He also served in the Sinai, and was second in command of his unit from August 1917. Rankin was present at the famous charge at Beersheba on 31 October, and in 1918 was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his gallantry. His leadership subsequently earned him a Bar to his DSO. The bar's citation reads:\n\nFor great gallantry, dash and initiative during the operations from El Kuneitra to Damascus. On the 30th September, 1918, when his regiment acted as advance guard from Sasa to Kaukab, owing to his rapid movements, they captured 340 prisoners, 1 field gun and 8 machine guns. Kaukab was strongly held by the enemy, and when this officer was ordered to make a frontal attack his leadership was excellent and his regiment seized all objectives, capturing 9 officers, over 70 other ranks and 8 machine guns. In this action the enemy's cavalry were driven in disorder towards Damascus. On the morning of the 1st October, 1918, when ordered to seize the Military Barracks in Damascus, he showed great skill in manoeuvring his troops in such a manner that he was largely instrumental in capturing the whole enemy garrison in Damascus, numbering over 11,000.\nAfter the conclusion of the war, Rankin was sent to Egypt to suppress a rebellion, after which he returned to Australia. He returned to the Militia, becoming a brigadier in 1936 and a major general in 1937. During this time, he developed an interest in politics, in particular the Country Party.", "has_answer": false}
{"entityID": "5543720", "text": "Rankin was elected chief president of the Victorian United Country Party (VUCP) in 1937, but resigned later that year in order to contest the seat of Bendigo in the Australian House of Representatives. He was elected, and became part of the faction of the Country Party that advocated coalition with the United Australia Party. However, he was forced to back down on this by the State council of the VUCP.\nRankin became well known as an advocate of returned servicemen and wheat-farmers. He was a voracious critic of the Labor governments of John Curtin and Ben Chifley. When in 1949, an electoral redistribution substantially changed Rankin's seat, he contested the Senate instead and won. He was returned in 1951, but his parliamentary activity steadily decreased. He remained an active and vigorous anti-communist until his retirement, due to ill health, in 1955.\nRankin died of cerebrovascular disease on 28 December 1957 at Rochester, where he was buried, and was survived by his wife.", "has_answer": false}

Between 1807 and 1817 several of his lyrics appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine.Mayne's Siller Gun was based on a Dumfries wapinschaw: the competitors were members of the corporations, and the prize a silver cannon-shaped tube presented by James VI.
