  "Public Opinion": "The term `` public opinion '' was derived from the French opinion publique , which was first used in 1588 by Michel de Montaigne in the second edition of his Essays ( ch . XXII ) .The French term also appears in the 1761 work Julie , or the New Heloise by Jean-Jacques Rousseau.Precursors of the phrase in English include William Temple 's `` general opinion '' ( appearing in his 1672 work On the Original and Nature of Government ) and John Locke 's `` law of opinion '' ( appearing in his 1689 work An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ) . The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm dates to the late 17th century , but opinion had been regarded as having singular importance much earlier . Medieval fama publica or vox et fama communis had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward . Later , William Shakespeare called public opinion the `` mistress of success '' and Blaise Pascal thought it was `` the queen of the world '' . In his treatise , An Essay Concerning Human Understanding c , John Locke considered that man was subject to three laws : the divine law , the civil law and most importantly in Locke 's judgement , the law of opinion or reputation . He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ill opinion force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms , however he did not consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments . In his 1672 essay On the Original and Nature of Government , William Temple gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion . He observed that `` when vast numbers of",

  "Aaron": "According to the Book of Exodus , Aaron first functioned as Moses ' assistant . Because Moses complained that he could not speak well , God appointed Aaron as Moses ' `` prophet '' ( Exodus 4:10-17 ; 7:1 ) . At the command of Moses , he let his rod turn into a snake . Then he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues . After that , Moses tended to act and speak for himself.During the journey in the wilderness , Aaron was not always prominent or active . At the battle with Amalek , he was chosen with Hur to support the hand of Moses that held the `` rod of God '' . When the revelation was given to Moses at Mount Sinai , he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied Moses on the way to the summit . While Joshua went with Moses to the top , however , Aaron and Hur remained below to look after the people . From here on in Exodus , Leviticus and Numbers , Joshua appears in the role of Moses ' assistant while Aaron functions instead as the first high priest . Aaron appears paired with Moses frequently in Jewish and Christian art , especially in the illustrations of manuscript and printed Bibles . He can usually be distinguished by his priestly vestments , especially his turban or miter and jeweled breastplate . He frequently holds a censer or , sometimes , his flowering rod . Aaron also appears in scenes depicting the wilderness Tabernacle and its altar , as already in the third-century frescos in the synagogue at Dura-Europos in Syria . An eleventh-century portable silver altar from Fulda , Germany depicts Aaron with his censor , and is located",

  "Our Lady of the Flowers": "The novel tells the story of Divine , a drag queen who , when the novel opens , has died of tuberculosis and been canonised as a result . The narrator tells us that the stories he is telling are mainly to amuse himself whilst he passes his sentence in prison \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the highly erotic , often explicitly sexual , stories are spun to assist his masturbation . Jean-Paul Sartre called it `` the epic of masturbation '' . Divine lives in an attic room overlooking Montmartre cemetery , which he shares with various lovers , the most important of whom is a pimp called Darling Daintyfoot ( `` Mignon-les-Petits-Pieds '' in French ) . One day Darling brings home a young hoodlum and murderer , dubbed Our Lady of the Flowers . Our Lady is eventually arrested and tried , and executed . Death and ecstasy accompany the acts of every character , as Genet performs a transvaluation of all values , making betrayal the highest moral value , murder an act of virtue and sexual appeal . Our Lady of the Flowers was written in prison . Genet wrote it on sheets of brown paper which prison authorities provided to prisoners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the intention that they would make bags of it . As recounted by Sartre in his foreword to Our Lady of the Flowers , a prison guard discovered that the prisoner Genet had been making this `` unauthorized '' use of the paper , confiscated the manuscript and burned it . Undaunted , Genet wrote it all over again . The second version survived and Genet took it with him when leaving the prison.Largely completed in 1942 , the book was first published anonymously by Robert Deno\u00c3\u00abl and Paul Moribien at the end of",
