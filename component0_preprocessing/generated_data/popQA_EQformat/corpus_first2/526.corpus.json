        "content": "Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film produced by, directed by, and starring Orson Welles. He also co-wrote the screenplay with Herman J. Mankiewicz. The picture was Welles' first feature film. Citizen Kane is considered by many critics and experts to be the greatest film ever made. For 50 consecutive years, it stood at number 1 in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound decennial poll of critics, and it topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years\u00a0... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as its 2007 update. The film was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories and it won for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Mankiewicz and Welles. Citizen Kane is praised for Gregg Toland's cinematography, Robert Wise's editing, Bernard Herrmann's music, and its narrative structure, all of which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting. The quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a composite character based on American media barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, as well as aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited the film from being mentioned in his newspapers. After the Broadway success of Welles's Mercury Theatre and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast \"The War of the Worlds\" on The Mercury Theatre on the Air, Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939. Although it was unusual for an untried director, he was given freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have final cut privilege. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane, collaborating with Herman J. Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film was released in 1941. Although it was a critical success, Citizen Kane failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but it returned to public attention when it was praised by French critics such as Andr\u00e9 Bazin and re-released in 1956. And later in 1958, the film was voted number 9 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. The film was made available on Blu-ray on September 13, 2011, as a special 70th-anniversary edition. Citizen Kane was selected by the Library of Congress as an inductee of the 1989 inaugural group of 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "In a mansion called Xanadu, part of a vast palatial estate in Florida, the elderly Charles Foster Kane is on his deathbed. Holding a snow globe, he utters a word, \"Rosebud\", and dies. A newsreel obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher and industrial magnate. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of \"Rosebud\". Thompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach his second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns about Kane's rise from a Colorado boarding house and the decline of his personal fortune. In 1871, gold was discovered through a mining deed belonging to Kane's mother, Mary Kane. She hired Thatcher to establish a trust that would provide for Kane's education and to assume guardianship of him. While the parents and Thatcher discussed arrangements inside the boarding house, the young Kane played happily with a sled in the snow outside. When Kane's parents introduced him to Thatcher, the boy struck Thatcher with his sled and attempted to run away. By the time Kane gained control of his trust at the age of 25, the mine's productivity and Thatcher's prudent investing had made him one of the richest men in the world. He took control of the New York Inquirer newspaper and embarked on a career of yellow journalism, publishing scandalous articles that attacked Thatcher's (and his own) business interests. Kane sold his newspaper empire to Thatcher after the 1929 stock market crash left him short of cash. Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls that Kane hired the best journalists available to build the Inquirers circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the Spanish\u2013American War and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of the President of the United States. Thompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a retirement home. Leland says that Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrated over the years, and he began an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while running for Governor of New York. Both his wife and his political opponent discovered the affair and the public scandal ended his political career. Kane married Susan and forced her into a humiliating operatic career for which she had neither the talent nor the ambition, even building a large opera house for her. After Leland began to write a negative review of Susan's opera debut, Kane fired him but finished the negative review and printed it. Susan consents to an interview with Thompson and describes the aftermath of her opera career. Kane finally allowed her to abandon singing after she attempted suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, she left him. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan left him, he began violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. When he happened upon a snow globe, he grew calm and said \"Rosebud\". Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will forever remain a mystery. Back at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are cataloged or discarded by the staff. They find the sled on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. They throw it with other junk into a furnace and, as it burns, the camera reveals its trade name, not noticed by the staff: \"Rosebud\"."

        "content": "Military tensions rise between the two Cold War powers led by the Soviet Union and the United States. Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact forces build on the border between East Germany and West Germany, and West Berlin is blockaded. A NATO attempt to break the blockade results in heavy casualties. Airman First Class Billy McCoy (William Allen Young) lives at Whiteman Air Force Base near Sedalia, Missouri. He is called to alert status at the Minuteman launch site he is stationed at in Sweetsage, Missouri,  from Kansas City. The Hendry family lives on a farm adjoining McCoy's launch site. The Dahlberg family lives on their farm  away from the Sweetsage launch site, in Harrisonville, Missouri,  from Kansas City. The Dahlbergs' eldest daughter Denise (Lori Lethin) is set to be married in two days to a student at the University of Kansas, and they perform their wedding dress rehearsal. The next day, the military conflict in Europe rapidly escalates. Tactical nuclear weapons are detonated by NATO to stop a Soviet Union advance into West Germany, and each side attacks naval targets in the Persian Gulf. Dr. Russell Oakes (Jason Robards), a doctor in Kansas City, Missouri, travels to Lawrence, Kansas, by car to teach a class at the University of Kansas hospital there. Pre-med University of Kansas student Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg) receives a physical at the hospital, hears the news from Europe, and decides to hitchhike toward home in Joplin, Missouri. As the threat of large-scale nuclear attack grows, hoarding begins, and so does evacuation of major cities in both the Soviet Union and United States. Frequent Emergency Broadcast System warnings are sent over television and radio, and Kansas City begins to empty, clogging outbound freeways. Dr. Oakes is among the many stuck in the traffic jam as he drives toward Lawrence, but, after hearing an EBS alert and realizing the danger to Kansas City and his family living there, decides to turn around and head home. Minutes apart, the United States launches its Minuteman missiles, and United States military personnel aboard the EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft track inbound Soviet nuclear missiles. The film deliberately leaves unclear who fired theirs first. Billy McCoy flees the site he was stationed at now that its Minuteman missile has been launched, intending to locate his wife and child. As air raid sirens go off, widespread panic grips Kansas City as most people frantically seek fallout shelters and other protection from the imminent Soviet nuclear attack. A high-altitude nuclear explosion occurs over the central United States, generating an electromagnetic pulse which disables vehicles and destroys the electrical grid. Shortly thereafter, high-yield nuclear weapons detonate over numerous locations, including downtown Kansas City, Sedalia, and Sweetsage. The Hendry family, having initially ignored the crisis, is killed when they try to flee. McCoy takes refuge in a truck trailer, and Klein, who had hitchhiked as far as Harrisonville, finds the Dahlberg home and begs for protection in the family's basement. In the meantime, young Danny Dahlberg is flash blinded upon looking at a nearby nuclear detonation. Dr. Oakes, who witnessed the nuclear explosion over Kansas City, walks to the hospital in Lawrence and begins treating patients. Nuclear fallout and its deadly effects are felt everywhere in the region. McCoy and Oakes, both outside immediately after the explosions, have been exposed without their knowledge to lethal doses of radiation. Denise Dahlberg, frantic after days in the family's basement shelter, runs outside, and Klein, who vows to her father that he'll bring her back, does so, but not before both have been exposed to very high doses of radiation. McCoy learns in his travels that Sedalia and many other cities have been obliterated. Food and water are in very short supply, and looting and other criminal activity leads to the imposition of martial law. Klein takes Denise and her brother Danny, who was blinded by one of the nuclear explosions, to the hospital in Lawrence for treatment. McCoy also travels there, where he dies of radiation poisoning. Denise and Danny Dahlberg, and Klein, finally leave for Harrisonville and the Dahlberg farm, when it becomes clear to them they cannot be treated medically for their injuries; it is implied that Denise and Klein's conditions are terminal. Jim Dahlberg, returning home from a municipal meeting about agricultural techniques that may work to grow food in the new circumstances, finds squatters on the farm. He explains that it is his land, and asks them to leave, at which point one of the squatters shoots and kills him without any sign of remorse. Dr. Oakes, at last aware he has sustained lethal exposure to radiation, returns to Kansas City on foot to see the site of his home before he dies. He finds squatters there, attempts to drive them off, and is instead offered food. Oakes collapses, weeps, and one of the squatters comforts him. The film ends as Lawrence science faculty head Joe Huxley repeatedly tries to contact other survivors with a shortwave radio. There is no response."

        "title": "The Day After_Production",
        "content": "The Day After was the idea of ABC Motion Picture Division president Brandon Stoddard, who, after watching The China Syndrome, was so impressed that he envisioned creating a film exploring the effects of nuclear war on the United States. Stoddard asked his executive vice president of television movies and miniseries Stu Samuels to develop a script. Samuels created the title The Day After to emphasize that the story was not about a nuclear war itself, but the aftermath. Samuels suggested several writers and eventually Stoddard commissioned veteran television writer Edward Hume to write the script in 1981. ABC, which financed the production, was concerned about the graphic nature of the film and how to appropriately portray the subject on a family-oriented television channel. Hume undertook a massive amount of research on nuclear war and went through several drafts until finally ABC deemed the plot and characters acceptable. Originally, the film was based more around and in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City was not bombed in the original script, although Whiteman Air Force Base was, making Kansas City suffer shock waves and the horde of survivors staggering into town. There was no Lawrence, Kansas in the story, although there was a small Kansas town called \"Hampton\". While Hume was writing the script, he and producer Robert Papazian, who had great experience in on-location shooting, took several trips to Kansas City to scout locations and met with officials from the Kansas film commission and from the Kansas tourist offices to search for a suitable location for \"Hampton.\" It came down to a choice of either Warrensburg, Missouri, and Lawrence, Kansas, both college towns\u2014Warrensburg was home of Central Missouri State University and was near Whiteman Air Force Base and Lawrence was home of the University of Kansas and was near Kansas City. Hume and Papazian ended up selecting Lawrence, due to the access to a number of good locations: a university, a hospital, football and basketball venues, farms, and a flat countryside. Lawrence was also agreed upon as being the \"geographic center\" of the United States. The Lawrence people were urging ABC to change the name \"Hampton\" to \"Lawrence\" in the script. Back in Los Angeles, the idea of making a TV movie showing the true effects of nuclear war on average American citizens was still stirring up controversy. ABC, Hume, and Papazian realized that for the scene depicting the nuclear blast, they would have to use state-of-the-art special effects and they took the first step by hiring some of the best special effects people in the business to draw up some storyboards for the complicated blast scene. Then, ABC hired Robert Butler to direct the project. For several months, this group worked on drawing up storyboards and revising the script again and again; then, in early 1982, Butler was forced to leave The Day After because of other contractual commitments. ABC then offered the project to two other directors, who both turned it down. Finally, in May, ABC hired feature film director Nicholas Meyer, who had just completed the blockbuster Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Meyer was apprehensive at first and doubted ABC would get away with making a television film on nuclear war without the censors diminishing its effect. However, after reading the script, Meyer agreed to direct The Day After. Meyer wanted to make sure he would film the script he was offered. He did not want the censors to censor the film, nor the film to be a regular Hollywood disaster movie from the start. Meyer figured the more The Day After resembled such a film, the less effective it would be, and preferred to present the facts of nuclear war to viewers. He made it clear to ABC that no big TV or film stars should be in The Day After. ABC agreed, although they wanted to have one star to help attract European audiences to the film when it would be shown theatrically there. Later, while flying to visit his parents in New York City, Meyer happened to be on the same plane with Jason Robards and asked him to join the cast. Meyer plunged into several months of nuclear research, which made him quite pessimistic about the future, to the point of becoming ill each evening when he came home from work. Meyer and Papazian also made trips to the ABC censors, and to the United States Department of Defense during their research phase, and experienced conflicts with both. Meyer had many heated arguments over elements in the script that the network censors wanted cut out of the film. The Department of Defense said they would cooperate with ABC if the script made clear that the Soviet Union launched their missiles first\u2014something Meyer and Papazian took pains not to do. Meyer, Papazian, Hume, and several casting directors spent most of July 1982 taking numerous trips to Kansas City. In between casting in Los Angeles, where they relied mostly on unknowns, they would fly to the Kansas City area to interview local actors and scenery. They were hoping to find some real Midwesterners for smaller roles. Hollywood casting directors strolled through shopping malls in Kansas City, looking for local people to fill small and supporting roles, while the daily newspaper in Lawrence ran an advertisement calling for local residents of all ages to sign up for jobs as a large number of extras in the film and a professor of theater and film at the University of Kansas was hired to head up the local casting of the movie. Out of the eighty or so speaking parts, only fifteen were cast in Los Angeles. The remaining roles were filled in Kansas City and Lawrence. While in Kansas City, Meyer and Papazian toured the Federal Emergency Management Agency offices in Kansas City. When asked what their plans for surviving nuclear war were, a FEMA official replied that they were experimenting with putting evacuation instructions in telephone books in New England. \"In about six years, everyone should have them.\" This meeting led Meyer to later refer to FEMA as \"a complete joke.\" It was during this time that the decision was made to change \"Hampton\" in the script to \"Lawrence.\" Meyer and Hume figured since Lawrence was a real town, that it would be more believable and besides, Lawrence was a perfect choice to play a representative of Middle America. The town boasted a \"socio-cultural mix,\" sat near the exact geographic center of the continental U.S., and Hume and Meyer's research told them that Lawrence was a prime missile target, because 150 Minuteman missile silos stood nearby. Lawrence had some great locations, and the people there were more supportive of the project. Suddenly, less emphasis was put on Kansas City, the decision was made to have the city completely annihilated in the script, and Lawrence was made the primary location in the film."

        "content": "Basil is a Greek-British writer raised in the UK who bears the hallmarks of an uptight, middle-class Englishman. He is waiting at the Athens port of Piraeus on mainland Greece to catch a boat to Crete when he meets a gruff, yet enthusiastic Greek-Macedonian peasant and musician named Zorba. Basil explains to Zorba that he is traveling to a rural Cretan village where his father owns some land, with the intention of reopening a lignite mine and perhaps curing his writer's block. Zorba relates his experience with mining and persuades Basil to take him along. When they arrive at Crete, they take a car to the village where they are greeted enthusiastically by the town's impoverished peasant community. They stay with an old French former courtesan named Madame Hortense in her self-styled \"Hotel Ritz\". The audacious Zorba tries to persuade Basil into making a move on Madame Hortense, but when he is reluctant, Zorba seizes the opportunity, and they form a relationship. Over the next few days, Basil and Zorba attempt to work the old lignite mine, but find it unsafe and shut it down.  Zorba then has an idea to use the forest in the nearby mountains for logging, (his specific plan is left ambiguous, but it seems he thinks the timber can be used to shore up the tunnels). The land is owned by a monastery, so Zorba visits and befriends the monks, getting them drunk. Afterwards, he comes home to Basil and begins to dance in a way that mesmerizes Basil. Meanwhile, Basil and Zorba get their first introduction to \"the Widow\", a young and attractive widowed woman, who is teased incessantly by the townspeople for not remarrying, especially to a young local boy who is madly in love with her, but whom she has spurned repeatedly. One rainy afternoon, Basil offers her his umbrella, which she reluctantly takes. Zorba suggests that she is attracted to him, but Basil, ever shy, denies this and refuses to pursue the widow. Basil hands Zorba some money, and sends him off to the large town of Chania, where Zorba is to buy cable and other supplies for the implementation of his grand plan. Zorba says goodbye to Basil and Madame Hortense, who is by now madly in love with him. In Chania, Zorba entertains himself at a cabaret and has a brief romance with a much younger dancer. In a letter to Basil, he details his exploits and indicates that he has found love. Angered by Zorba's apparent irresponsibility and the squandering of his money, Basil untruthfully tells Madame Hortense that Zorba has declared his love to her and intends to marry her upon his return, which makes her ecstatic to the point of tears. Meanwhile, the Widow returns Basil's umbrella by way of Mimithos, the village idiot. When Zorba eventually returns with supplies and gifts, he is surprised and angered to hear of Basil's lie to Madame Hortense. He also asks Basil about his whereabouts the night before. That night, Basil had gone to the Widow's house and spent the night. The brief encounter comes at great cost. A villager catches sight of them, and word spreads, and the young local boy who is in love with the Widow is told about it. The next morning, the villagers find his body by the sea, where he has drowned himself out of shame. The boy's father, Mavrandoni, holds a funeral which the villagers attend. The widow attempts to come inconspicuously, but is blocked from entering the church. She is eventually trapped in the courtyard, then beaten and stoned by the villagers, who hold her responsible for the boy's suicide. Basil tells Mimithos to fetch Zorba. Zorba arrives just as a villager, a friend of the boy, tries to kill the widow with a knife. Zorba overpowers the much younger man and disarms him. Thinking that the situation is under control, Zorba asks the Widow to follow him and turns his back. At that moment, the dead boy's father pulls his knife and cuts the widow's throat. She dies at once, as the villagers shuffle away apathetically, whisking the father away. Only Basil, Zorba, and Mimithos show any emotion over her murder. Basil proclaims his inability to intervene whereupon Zorba laments the futility of death. On a rainy day, Basil and Zorba come home and find Madame Hortense waiting. She expresses anger at Zorba for making no progress on the wedding. Zorba conjures up a story that he had ordered a white satin wedding dress, lined with pearls and adorned with real gold. Madame Hortense presents two golden rings she had made and proposes their immediate engagement. Zorba tries to stall, but eventually agrees with gusto, to Basil's surprise. Some time later, Madame Hortense has contracted pneumonia, and is seen on her deathbed. Zorba stays by her side, along with Basil. Meanwhile, word has spread that \"the foreigner\" is dying, and since she has no heirs, the State will take her possessions and money. The poor villagers crowd around her hotel, impatiently waiting for her demise so they can steal her belongings. As two old ladies enter her room and gaze expectantly at her, other women try to enter, but Zorba manages to fight them off. At the instant of her death, the women re-enter Madame Hortense's bedroom en masse to steal her valued possessions. Zorba leaves with a sigh, as the hotel is ransacked and stripped bare by the shrieking and excited villagers. When Zorba returns to Madame Hortense's bedroom, the room is barren apart from her bed (where she lies) and the parrot in her cage. Zorba takes the birdcage with him. Finally, Zorba's elaborate contraption to transport timber down the hill is complete. A festive ceremony, including lamb on a spit, is held, and all the villagers turn out. After a blessing from the priests, Zorba signals the start by firing a rifle in the air. A log comes hurtling down the zip line at a worrying pace, destroying the log itself and slightly damaging part of the contraption. Zorba remains unconcerned and gives orders for a second log. This one also speeds down and shoots straight into the sea. By now the villagers and priests have grown fearful and head for cover. Zorba remains unfazed and orders a third log, which accelerates downhill with such violence that it dislodges the entire contraption, destroying everything. The villagers flee, leaving Basil and Zorba behind. Basil and Zorba sit by the shore to eat roasted lamb. Zorba pretends to tell the future from the lamb shank, saying that he foresees a great journey to a big city. He then asks Basil directly when he plans to leave, and Basil replies that he will leave in a few days. Zorba declares his sadness about Basil's imminent departure to England and tells Basil that he is missing madness. Basil asks Zorba to teach him to dance. Zorba teaches him the sirtaki and Basil begins to laugh hysterically at the catastrophic outcome. The story ends with both men enthusiastically dancing the sirtaki on the beach."

        "content": "Independence Day (also promoted as ID4) is a 1996 American science fiction action film directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Emmerich and Dean Devlin. It stars an ensemble cast that includes Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, Harvey Fierstein, and Harry Connick. The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an extraterrestrial race. With the other people of the world, they launch a counterattack on July 4\u2014Independence Day in the United States. While promoting Stargate in Europe, Emmerich conceived the film while answering a question about his belief in the existence of alien life. He and Devlin decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was completed on June 20, 1996. Considered a significant turning point in the history of the Hollywood blockbuster, Independence Day was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. It was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in original release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mixed to positive reviews, with praise for the performances, musical score and visual effects but criticism for its characters. It grossed over $817.4\u00a0million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996, surpassing Twister and Mission: Impossible. It also became the second-highest-grossing film ever at the time, behind Jurassic Park (1993). The film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound. A sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence, was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, part of a planned series of films."

        "content": "On July 2, 1996, an enormous alien mothership arrives in the orbit of the Earth and deploys multiple saucers, each  wide that take positions over Earth's major cities. U.S. Marine Captain Steven Hiller is deployed despite being on leave; his girlfriend, Jasmine Dubrow, worried about the aliens, decides to flee Los Angeles with her son, Dylan Dubrow. In New York City, David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David and his father Julius gain access to the Oval Office and alert President Thomas Whitmore to the threat. Whitmore orders evacuations of New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., but it is too late. Each of the saucers fires a single destructive beam, causing a gargantuan explosion that incinerates each saucer's targeted city, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others escape aboard Air Force One as Washington, New York, Los Angeles, and other major cities around the world are destroyed instantly. Jasmine, Dylan, and their dog Boomer take shelter in a tunnel's inspection alcove, emerging once the destruction is over. On July 3, counterattacks against the alien invaders begin, but their ships are shielded by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of fighter vessels with their own shields, which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Hiller, one of the mission's squadron leaders, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon before ejecting from his plane, causing the enemy fighter to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, transporting the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Whitmore's group has landed. Defense Secretary Albert Nimzicki revealed that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished ship, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As chief scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it awakens, telepathically invades Okun's mind, kills other personnel, and launches a psychic attack against Whitmore. After Secret Service agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reveals what he learned when they were linked: the invaders plan to wipe out civilizations and strip Earth of its natural resources as they have done to many other planets before them. Whitmore reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack against one warship situated above Houston, as a trial, but the warship survives. Jasmin and Dylan, having commandeered a truck, rescue other survivors, including the critically injured First Lady Marilyn Whitmore. Though they are later found by Hiller and taken to Area 51, Marilyn dies shortly after being reunited with her family. On July 4, taking inspiration from his father, David Levinson writes a computer virus that will disrupt the aliens' shields' operating system, and devises a plan to upload it into the mothership from the refurbished alien fighter, which Hiller volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts different nations' surviving airborne squadrons around the world through Morse code to organize a united counter-offensive against the aliens. With the military manpower short on pilots, Whitmore and General William Grey enlist the help of volunteers with flight experience, including retired Vietnam soldier Russell Casse, to fly the remaining jets at Area 51; Whitmore leads an attack on a warship bearing down on the base while Grey oversees it. Hiller marries Jasmine with David and Constance in attendance before Hiller and Levinson leave on the mission. Entering the mothership, they upload the virus and deploy a nuclear missile on board, nullifying the aliens' communications system and its reinforcements once the ship is destroyed. With the aliens' shields deactivated, Whitmore's squadron can combat the enemy fighters, but their ammunition is exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile, but is unable to fire due to a launcher malfunction; he sacrifices himself by crashing his jet with the missile into the saucer's weapon as it is charging to fire, destroying the warship. Human military forces worldwide are notified of the alien ships' critical weakness and destroy the others. As humanity rejoices in victory, Hiller and Levinson return to Area 51 and reunite with their families."

        "content": "Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller, a Marine F/A-18 pilot with the Black Knight squadron at MCAS El Toro and aspiring astronaut. The role was originally offered to Ethan Hawke but he turned it down as he thought the script was terrible. Devlin and Emmerich had always envisioned an African-American for the role, and specifically wanted Smith after seeing his performance in Six Degrees of Separation. Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore, a former fighter pilot and Gulf War veteran. To prepare for the role, Pullman read Bob Woodward's The Commanders and watched the documentary film The War Room. Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, an MIT-educated satellite engineer and technological expert. Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore, the wife of Thomas Whitmore. Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson, David Levinson's father. The character was based on one of Dean Devlin's uncles. Robert Loggia as General William Grey, USMC, the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Loggia modeled the character after World War II generals, particularly George S. Patton. Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, an eccentric, alcoholic former fighter pilot and Vietnam War veteran. He insists that he was abducted by the aliens during work on aerial application ten years prior to the film's events, shortly after completing his military service. Margaret Colin as Constance Spano, Whitmore's White House Communications Director and David Levinson's ex-wife. Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow, Steven Hiller's girlfriend and mother of Dylan Dubrow. James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, the Secretary of Defense and, as former CIA Director, is a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence due to the ship recovered at Roswell. Not well-liked, lying, arrogant, selfish, and crooked, Nimzicki embodies the stereotypical corrupt politician, and his ambition is to be elected as president himself and often at odds with idealists such as Whitmore and Grey. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North. The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki, MGM's head of advertising, who made life unpleasant for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of Stargate. Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert, David Levinson's coworker at Compact Cable Television Company. Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell, USAF, Area 51's commanding officer and thus a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence. During the interstellar war, he becomes a trusted ally to Thomas Whitmore's party. Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun, the unkempt and highly excitable scientist in charge of research at Area 51. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on Stargate. James Duval as Miguel Casse, the oldest son of Russell Casse. Bill Smitrovich as Lt. Colonel Watson, the commanding officer of the Black Knights. Harry Connick Jr. as Marine Captain Jimmy Wilder, fellow fighter pilot and friend of Steven. Connick took over the role from Matthew Perry who was originally cast in the role. Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore, the daughter of President Thomas J. Whitmore and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore. Ross Bagley as Dylan Dubrow, Jasmine Dubrow's son and Steven Hiller's stepson.

        "title": "Total Recall (1990 film)_Summary",
        "content": "Total Recall is a 1990 American science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven, with a screenplay by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, and Michael Ironside. Based on the 1966 short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" by Philip K. Dick, Total Recall tells the story of Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker who receives an implanted memory of a fantastical adventure on Mars. He subsequently finds his adventure occurring in reality as agents of a shadow organization try to prevent him from recovering memories of his past as a Martian secret agent aiming to stop the tyrannical regime of Martian dictator Vilos Cohaagen (Cox). Shusett bought the rights to Dick's short story in 1974 and developed a script with O'Bannon. Although considered a promising idea, the project's ambitious scope kept it in various stages of development at multiple studios over sixteen years, seeing forty script drafts, seven different directors, and multiple actors cast as Quaid. Total Recall eventually entered the early stages of filming in 1987 under the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group shortly before its bankruptcy. Schwarzenegger, who had long held an interest in the project but had been dismissed as inappropriate for the lead role, convinced Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights and develop the film with him as the star. On an estimated $48\u201380million budget (making it one of the most expensive films made in its time), filming took place almost entirely on expansive sets at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico over six months. Cast and crew suffered numerous injuries and illnesses during filming. Total Recall was anticipated to be one of the year's most successful films. On its release, the film earned approximately $261.4million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year. Its critical reception was mixed, with reviewers praising its themes of identity and questioning reality, but criticizing content perceived as vulgar and violent. The practical special effects were also well received, earning the film an Academy Award, and the score by Jerry Goldsmith has been praised as one of his best works. Since its release, the film has been praised for its ambiguous ending positing whether Quaid's adventures are real or a fantasy. It has also been analyzed for themes of colonialism and authoritarianism, and criticized for elements perceived as sexist and racist. Retrospective reviews have called it one of Schwarzenegger's best films and placed it among the best science-fiction films ever made. Alongside comic books and video games, Total Recall has been adapted into the 1999 television series Total Recall 2070. An early attempt at a sequel, based on Dick's The Minority Report, became the 2002 stand-alone film Minority Report, and a 2012 remake, also called Total Recall failed to replicate the success of the original."

        "content": "In 2084, Mars is a colonized world under the tyrannical regime of Vilos Cohaagen, who controls the mining of valuable turbinium ore. On Earth, construction worker Douglas Quaid experiences recurring dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman. Intrigued, he visits Rekall, a company that implants realistic false memories, and chooses one set on Mars (with a blue sky) where he is a Martian secret agent. However, before the implant is completed Quaid lashes out, already thinking he is a secret agent. Believing Cohaagen's \"Agency\" has suppressed Quaid's memories, the Rekall employees erase evidence of Quaid's visit and send him home. En route, Quaid is attacked by men led by his work colleague Harry because Quaid unknowingly revealed his past; Quaid's instincts take over and he kills his assailants. At home, he is assaulted by his wife Lori who claims their marriage is a false memory implant, and the Agency assigned her to monitor Quaid. He flees but is pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband. A man claiming to be Quaid's former acquaintance gifts him a suitcase containing supplies and a video recording in which Quaid identifies himself as Hauser, a Cohaagen ally who defected after falling in love. According to the recording, Cohaagen brainwashed Hauser to become Quaid and conceal his secrets before securing him on Earth. Hauser instructs Quaid to return to Mars and stop Cohaagen. On Mars, Quaid evades Richter and, following a note from Hauser, travels to Venusville, a district populated by humans and those mutated by air pollution and radiation. He meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, who knows him as Hauser and believes he is still working for Cohaagen. In his hotel room, Quaid is confronted by Lori and Dr. Edgemar from Rekall, who explains that Quaid is trapped in his fantasy memory and is still at Rekall on Earth. Quaid notices Edgemar is sweating and, believing he is real, kills him. Quaid is captured by Richter's men, but Melina rescues him and Quaid kills Lori. The pair escape with taxi driver Benny to Venusville. The mutants lead them to a hidden rebel base, where Quaid meets their leader Kuato, a mutant growing out of the abdomen of his brother George. Kuato psychically reads Quaid's mind, learning that Cohaagen is hiding a 500,000-year-old alien reactor built into a mountain that, once activated, produces breathable air but could also destroy all turbinium, ending Cohaagen's monopoly over both resources. Benny shoots George, revealing himself to be in Cohaagen's employ, and Cohaagen's forces attack the base, killing the rebels. Kuato implores Quaid to start the reactor before Richter executes him. Cohaagen disables Venusville's air supply to slowly suffocate the remaining inhabitants. Quaid and Melina are brought to Cohaagen, who explains that Hauser was his close friend who volunteered to become Quaid as an elaborate ruse to bypass the mutants' psychic abilities, infiltrate the rebellion, and destroy it. Quaid's Rekall visit had activated him earlier than planned and Cohaagen has been helping him to survive the oblivious Richter's pursuit. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be restored in Quaid and Melina to be reprogrammed as his subservient lover, but they manage to escape to the mines below the reactor. Benny, Richter, and his men attack them, but the pair outwits and kills them all. Cohaagen awaits them in the reactor control room, claiming that activating it will destroy the planet. He sets off an explosive but Quaid throws it down a tunnel, creating a breach to the Martian surface. The explosive decompression blows Cohaagen out to the surface where he suffocates and dies. Quaid activates the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor melts the planet's ice core into gas that bursts to the surface, forming a breathable atmosphere and saving Quaid, Melina, and the rest of Mars's population. As everyone beholds the now-blue sky, Quaid momentarily wonders if everything was a dream, before he and Melina share a kiss."

        "content": "Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man. A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character. Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2008. The film received praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Two sequels have been released: Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013)."

        "content": "Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant colonel James Rhodes, to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself. At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is attacked by two F-22 Raptors. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been trafficking arms to the Ten Rings and has staged a coup to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities. Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and steals the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it before dying. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed \"Iron Man\". In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \"Avenger Initiative\"."

        "content": "Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: An industrialist, genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. Director Jon Favreau felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part and that the actor could not only make Stark a \"likable asshole,\" but also portray an authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience. Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, Shane Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man. Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process, especially when it came to adding humor to the film. Downey explained, \"What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into Dudley Do-Right, and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That Eliot Ness-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor.\" To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week weight training and practiced martial arts, which he said benefited him because \"it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day.\" Terrence Howard as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes: A friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Air Force in the department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play War Machine in a sequel. Howard prepared for the role by visiting Nellis Air Force Base on March 16, 2007, where he ate with the pilots and observed HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and F-22 Raptors. While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he meets Stark, his previous role as a disciplinarian creates a dynamic tension with Stark's character. He is unsure whether Stark's actions are acceptable. \"Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life, but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way,\" Howard said. \"Whose life is the right way: Is it the strict military life, or the life of an independent?\" Howard and his father are Iron Man fans, partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when Howard was a child. He has been a Downey fan since he saw him in Weird Science; the two competed physically on set. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane: Stark's business second-in-command, mentor, and friend, who turns on him to take over the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau's modern, realistic approach. He shaved his head, something he had wanted to do for some time, and grew a beard for the role. Bridges researched the Book of Obadiah, and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that book of the Bible, something that Stane represents. Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of \"less is more\" when editing the film. Shaun Toub as Ho Yinsen: Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest \"to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him\" and helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit. Gwyneth Paltrow as Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts: Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, level-headed, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant.\" Favreau wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way. Additionally, Faran Tahir appears as Raza, the leader of the Ten Rings; Paul Bettany voices J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's personal AI system; Leslie Bibb portrays Christine Everhart, a reporter for Vanity Fair; and Clark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Will Lyman provides the voice-over during the opening award ceremony. Director Jon Favreau plays Harold \"Happy\" Hogan, Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, and Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene. Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury. Other cameos in the film include Stan Lee as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark at a party; Peter Billingsley as William Ginter Riva, a scientist who works for Stane; Tom Morello, who provided guitar music for the film, as a terrorist guard; and Jim Cramer as himself. Ghostface Killah, who often adopted Iron Man's name as an alias, had a cameo in a scene where Stark stays in Dubai, but the scene was cut for pacing reasons."

As a result, Jerry is forced to work for Margolese's second-in-command, Bernie Nayman. Five years later, Nayman sends Jerry on his final errand: retrieving an antique pistol for Margolese in Mexico. This proves to be the last straw for Jerry's girlfriend Sam, who leaves him to move to Las Vegas. Arriving in Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol with Beck, who explains the history of the legendary gun known as \"the Mexican\". When Beck is killed by a stray bullet from celebratory gunfire, Jerry calls his colleague Ted and learns that Beck was Margolese's grandson, but his car is stolen with Beck's body and the pistol inside. He recovers the car and the gun, shooting one of the thieves in the foot and burying the body. En route to Las Vegas, a well-dressed hitman tries to abduct Sam, but is shot by another hitman who captures her instead. The second hitman introduces himself as Leroy, explaining that he was hired to hold her hostage to ensure Jerry delivers the pistol. Bonding with Leroy, Sam deduces that he is gay and encourages him to pick up Frank, a traveling postal worker. The three of them reach Las Vegas, and Leroy and Frank spend the night together. In Mexico, Jerry is briefly arrested after a police officer notices Beck's blood in his car. Confiscating the pistol, the officer elaborates on its cursed history and brings it to a pawn shop. Ted arrives and reveals that the infamous Leroy has been sent after Sam, and Jerry overhears a call with Nayman ordering Ted to kill him. They recover the pistol from the pawn shop, but Jerry confronts Ted and leaves with the gun. Realizing he grabbed Ted's passport instead of his own, he returns to find Ted has already fled. In Las Vegas, the well-dressed hitman murders Frank and returns for Sam, but is killed by a vengeful Leroy. Sam and Leroy fly to Mexico to meet Jerry, who crashes the car in an argument with Sam. Leroy finds the pistol and prepares to kill Jerry, but Jerry kills him first. He explains to a distraught Sam that Leroy was an imposter \u2013 his driver\u2019s license reveals he is actually Winston Baldry \u2013 and that Jerry once met the real Leroy: the well-dressed hitman. Jerry realizes that Margolese hired the real Leroy, but Nayman sent Baldry to intercept Sam and the pistol, allowing him to sell it himself and frame Jerry. Sam and Jerry prepare to go their separate ways, but Sam remembers Baldry's advice and reconciles with Jerry, who is kidnapped by the thieves who stole his car. He is brought to Margolese, newly released from prison, who explains the true story of the pistol: it was crafted by a gunsmith for his daughter's marriage to a nobleman's cruel son, but the daughter and the gunsmith's assistant were truly in love. When the gun refused to fire for the nobleman's son, he killed the assistant, leading the daughter to take her own life with the pistol. Margolese reveals that his cellmate was the gunsmith's great-grandson; he was killed protecting Margolese, who swore to return the pistol to his cellmate's father. Jerry agrees to give him the pistol, but Nayman kidnaps Sam. A Mexican standoff ensues, until Sam kills Nayman with the pistol; the shot dislodges a ring from the gunbarrel, which Jerry uses to propose to Sam. The Mexican pistol is restored to the gunsmith's family, as Jerry and Sam drive off together."

The screenplay for Nashville was written by Altman's frequent collaborator Joan Tewkesbury, based partly on her experiences as an outsider visiting the city and observing its local music industry. Several incidents she experienced appear in the finished film, though Altman improvised numerous additional scenes and plot strands during filming. The film was shot on location in Nashville in 1974. Nashville was released by Paramount Pictures in the summer of 1975, and opened to critical acclaim, praising the ensemble cast and soundtrack. It garnered numerous accolades, including five Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Original Song for Carradine's track \"I'm Easy\". The film was nominated for a total of 11 Golden Globe Awards, to date the highest number of nominations received by one film. Selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1992, it is now considered Altman's magnum opus, and one of the greatest films of all time."

Joan\", is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer. On the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from heat exhaustion, and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea, as well as Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic at Lady Pearl's club, demonstrating no singing ability. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two deaf children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea earlier that day, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the Grand Ole Opry. Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another nervous breakdown. On Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a Catholic mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a black Baptist church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings \"In the Garden\" from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs. After Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives a performance at Opryland USA that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to investigate his violin case. At Lady Pearl's club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \"I'm Easy\" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Tom is accustomed to women becoming clingy and emotional after trysts but Linnea is polite but detached afterwards. She leaves Tom\u2019s room oblivious to his blatant attempts to rattle her and make her jealous, frustrating him. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a striptease in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but Wade rescues her. He tells her that she cannot sing and attempts to persuade her to come to Detroit with him; she refuses, determined to \"sing with Barbara Jean\". The next morning, the performers and audience converge at the Parthenon for Walker's gala concert. The lineup consists of Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther's funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean's set, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. A bullet grazes Haven's arm, but Barbara Jean is seriously injured. Pfc. Kelly disarms Kenny as chaos breaks out. Barbara Jean is carried from the stage, bleeding and unconscious, while Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that \"This isn't Dallas\". Winifred is handed the microphone in the melee, and begins singing \"It Don't Worry Me\", joined by Linnea's gospel choir."

        "content": "Sarah Bailey, a beautiful but troubled teenage girl with unusual abilities, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls who are considered outcasts for one reason or another and rumored to be witches. Bonnie Harper bears burn scars from an auto accident, Nancy Downs lives in a trailer with her mother and abusive stepfather, and Rochelle Zimmerman is African American and subjected to racist bullying by a group of popular white girls. The girls all worship a powerful deity they call \"Manon\". Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris Hooker but when Bonnie observes her levitating a pencil in class, she and the other outcast girls become convinced that she is the right person to complete their coven as \"the fourth\", completing an air-water-earth-fire circle and making them all powerful. One afternoon, Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house) and he is immediately hit by a car. The girls believe that together they willed it to happen and the event strengthens the bond among them. It is also revealed that Sarah has attempted suicide in the past. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to find that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex and she was terrible in bed. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. In response, Sarah casts a love spell on him. Rochelle then casts a revenge spell on racist bully Laura Lizzie, Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy a spell for power. It very soon becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back miraculously heal, and Rochelle's bully, Laura, begins to lose her hair. Nancy causes her stepfather to have a heart attack and die, enabling her and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move out of the trailer park they had been living in and into a luxurious high-rise apartment. Nancy quickly becomes power hungry and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \"Invocation of the Spirit,\" despite being warned against the spell by Lirio, the owner of a local occult shop and practicing witch. Upon completion of the complicated spell, Nancy is struck by lightning. The following morning, the other girls see Nancy walking on water, with beached sharks and other dead animals littering the shore. In the days that follow, Nancy becomes increasingly devoid of empathy and engages in risky behavior that endangers her life and those of others. The spells the girls cast eventually lead to negative consequences, as Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic, Rochelle finds Laura traumatized by her baldness and sobbing hysterically, and the obsessed Chris attempts to rape Sarah after she rejects his continual advances. In supposed retaliation, Nancy uses a glamour spell to make herself look like Sarah and attempts to fool Chris into having sex with her at a party. She is interrupted by the real Sarah, who tells Nancy to leave with her, but it becomes obvious that Nancy's desire to control Chris is mixed with unrequited feelings. Upset at being fooled, Chris says Nancy must be jealous, angering her, and she uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window. Sarah attempts a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but it does not work and the coven turns on Sarah. They invade her dreams, torment her with visions of swarms of snakes, rats, and insects, and make her believe that her family has died in a plane crash. Sarah seeks out Lirio, but changes her mind and leaves before Lirio can offer help. The rest of the coven then try to induce Sarah to commit suicide, and Nancy cuts Sarah's wrists herself. Although initially terrified, Sarah successfully invokes the spirit and is able to heal herself and fight back. She scares off Bonnie and Rochelle by showing them glamours in a mirror of Bonnie with her face scarred and Rochelle losing her hair like Laura. Sarah then defeats Nancy and binds her, preventing her from causing harm forever. Bonnie and Rochelle, finding their powers gone, visit Sarah to attempt reconciliation, only to find that she wants nothing to do with them and that Manon took their powers because they abused them. They scornfully mutter that Sarah must have lost her powers too but Sarah then makes a tree branch nearly fall on them. She warns them to be careful not to end up like Nancy. In the final scene, Nancy has been committed to a psychiatric hospital, delusional and stripped of her powers, and strapped to her bed as she desperately insists she can fly."

        "content": "The concept for The Craft came from a collaboration between producer Douglas Wick, who wanted to create a film about the high school experience blended with witchcraft, and screenwriter Peter Filardi, who extensively researched the topic and wrote the initial draft. Andrew Fleming was hired to direct and produce the final version of the screenplay. Eighty-five other actresses screen-tested for the four main roles, including Angelina Jolie, Scarlett Johansson and Alicia Silverstone. Rachel True and Fairuza Balk were the first to be cast in their respective roles. The character of Rochelle was re-written to be black when True was cast, incorporating racism subplot as the character's major conflict. Robin Tunney was initially cast in the role of Bonnie, but the producers decided she would be better in the starring role of Sarah, which she was persuaded to accept despite preferring the former. Neve Campbell, the most well known of the four actresses for her role on Party of Five, was then cast as Bonnie. Tunney had shaved her head for her role in Empire Records and had to wear a wig throughout filming. Production enlisted a real-life Wiccan named Pat Devin to act as an on-set advisor for the film. She wrote the incantations used and ensured that the treatment of the Wiccan subject-matter was as accurate and respectful as possible. The shooting took place throughout Los Angeles, including the Los Angeles International Airport, Sunset Boulevard, and Broadway. Verdugo Hills High School was the setting for the fictional Catholic school, St. Benedict's Academy; production designer Marek Dobrowolski added different religious statues throughout the building and the grounds. Sarah's home in the film was a two-story Spanish mansion and the interiors were built on a soundstage at Culver City Studios. The occult bookstore was shot at the El Adobe Marketplace in Hollywood Boulevard. The room was repainted and enhanced and occult icons such as candles, stigmas, religious statues, masks, and tribal dolls were added for effect. Jensen's Recreation Center in Echo Park was chosen to avoid overuse of frequently seen Los Angeles locations. During filming, an unrelated accident occurred in which a child was injured; the production's medic saw this and called paramedics. The makeshift altar was set in Wood Ranch, a location that Dobrowolski called the hardest to find. Dobrowolski wanted to avoid manicured parks like Griffith Park. The beach summoning took place at Leo Carrillo State Park, which was chosen because its crest made it seem less visually boring. The makeup effects were designed and created by Tony Gardner and his special effects company Alterian, Inc., which also created the beached sharks for the film."

When she inquires about the factory at the camp, a fellow inmate informs her that it is a crematorium and that the rest of her family likely has been murdered. The character Marta Weiss is based on the true life of Mala Zimetbaum. In the barracks, many of the women are dying and ill. Eugenia, a prisoner and doctor, tries her best to administer to them but is unable to do much as supplies are limited. The women learn that an international commission is coming to the camp to observe the conditions of the prisoners. Eugenia learns a few key phrases in German and is able to tell the observers that everything they see is a lie and people are dying. Unfortunately the commanders tell the observers that Eugenia is mentally ill. Later they torture her to find out who taught her the German phrases but Eugenia refuses to tell them and is murdered. Eugenia is replaced by Lalunia, a Polish woman who claims to have been rounded up by mistake and who says she is a doctor though she is actually only a pharmacist's wife. However rather than administer medicine to the women of the camp she distributes them among the Kapos in exchange for luxuries like clothes and perfume. The nurses' aide searches her room and confiscates the remaining medicine. Lalunia later turns the aide in and has her killed after discovering messages she had written that the Russians were advancing. Meanwhile, Marta is able to temporarily escape in order to smuggle information about the camps to a resistance broadcaster. When she is returned to the camp, she is tortured and then sentenced to death by hanging. A prisoner frees her wrists and hands her a knife before she is to die, and she tells the camp that the Russians are coming and slashes the face of the Nazi commander who tortured her.

She invites long-time frenemy Helen Sharp, an aspiring writer, backstage along with Helen's fianc\u00e9, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Smitten with Madeline, Ernest breaks off his engagement with Helen to marry her instead. Seven years later, Helen is obese, depressed and committed to a psychiatric hospital where she plots revenge on Madeline. Another seven years later, Madeline and Ernest live in Beverly Hills, but they are miserable: Madeline's acting career has declined and Ernest, now an alcoholic, has been reduced to working as a reconstructive mortician. Receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives facial treatments. Understanding Madeline's desperation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle Von Rhuman, a mysterious, wealthy socialite who specializes in rejuvenation. Madeline and Ernest attend the party for Helen's novel, Forever Young, and discover that Helen is slim, glamorous and youthful. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helen's appearance, Madeline witnesses Helen tell Ernest that she blames Madeline for his career decline. After the soiree, Madeline visits her young lover, but discovers he is with a woman his age. Dejected, Madeline drives to Lisle's home. Lisle, claiming to be 71, but looking decades younger, reveals a potion that promises eternal life and an everlasting youthful appearance. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is rejuvenated, regaining her beauty. As a condition of purchase, Lisle warns Madeline to disappear from the public eye after ten years to keep the potion's existence secret, and to take good care of her body. Helen seduces Ernest and convinces him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she and Ernest argue, during which she falls down the stairs, breaking her neck. Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, initially not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backward. At Madeline's request, Ernest drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead, and faints. She is taken to the morgue due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below . After rescuing Madeline, Ernest considers her reanimation a miracle and uses his skills as a mortician to repair her body at home. Helen demands information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to kill her, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. Although the blast creates a hole in her abdomen, Helen rises, undead like Madeline, revealing that she too drank the potion, in 1985. The two briefly fight before apologizing and reconciling their friendship. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize they will need regular maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available. After bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge in exchange for his surgical skills. Ernest refuses to drink it upon realizing that he will be their servant for all time. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest, realizing that they only need him for their own selfish reasons, refuses and drops the potion to the ground, but after falling he lands in Lisle's pool and escapes. Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, leaving the pair to rely on each other for companionship and maintenance. Thirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life with a large family and friends. The two women have become grotesque in appearance, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. They mock the eulogy and leave early; outside the church, Helen slips on a dropped can of spray paint and falls down a flight of steps, dragging Madeline with her. Their bodies shatter to pieces at the curb, and Helen sardonically asks Madeline if she remembers where they parked their car."

        "content": "Alphaville: une \u00e9trange aventure de Lemmy Caution (Alphaville: A Strange Adventure of Lemmy Caution) is a 1965 French New Wave science fiction neo-noir film directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It stars Eddie Constantine, Anna Karina, Howard Vernon and Akim Tamiroff. The film won the Golden Bear award of the 15th Berlin International Film Festival in 1965. Alphaville combines the genres of dystopian science fiction and film noir. There are no special props or futuristic sets; instead, the film was shot in real locations in Paris, the night-time streets of the capital becoming the streets of Alphaville, while modernist glass and concrete buildings (that in 1965 were new and strange architectural designs) represent the city's interiors. The film is set in the future but the characters also refer to twentieth-century events; for example, the hero describes himself as a Guadalcanal veteran. Expatriate American actor Eddie Constantine plays Lemmy Caution, a trenchcoat-wearing secret agent. Constantine had already played this or similar roles in dozens of previous films; the character was originally created by British pulp novelist Peter Cheyney. However, in Alphaville, director Jean-Luc Godard moves Caution away from his usual twentieth-century setting and places him in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia, the technocratic dictatorship of Alphaville."

        "content": "Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from \"the Outlands\". Entering Alphaville in his Ford Galaxie, he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda. Caution is on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun, which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because\". People who show signs of emotion are presumed to be acting illogically and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society. Images of the E\u00a0=\u00a0mc2 and E\u00a0=\u00a0hf (the iconic equations of, respectively, Special relativity and Quantum mechanics, the two great scientific developments of the first half of the twentieth century) are displayed several times throughout the film as referents for the scientism that underpins Alphaville. At one point, Caution passes through a place called the Grand Omega Minus, from where brainwashed people are sent out to the other \"galaxies\" to start strikes, revolutions, family rows, and student revolts. As an archetypal American anti-hero private eye in trenchcoat and with weathered visage, Lemmy Caution's old-fashioned machismo conflicts with the puritanical computer (Godard originally wanted to title the film Tarzan versus IBM). The opposition of his role to logic (and that of other dissidents to the regime) is represented by faux-quotations from Capitale de la douleur (\"Capital of Pain\"), a book of poems by Paul \u00c9luard. Caution meets Dickson, who soon dies in the process of making love to a \"Seductress Third Class\". Caution then enlists the assistance of Natacha von Braun (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60 and daughter of Professor von Braun. Natacha is a citizen of Alphaville and when questioned, says that she does not know the meaning of \"love\" or \"conscience\". Caution falls in love with her, and his love introduces emotion and unpredictability into the city. Natacha discovers, with the help of Lemmy Caution, that she was actually born outside of Alphaville. (The city name is given as Nueva York\u2014Spanish for New York\u2014instead of either the original English name or the French literal rendering \"Nouvelle York\".) Professor von Braun (the name is a reference to the German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun) was originally known as Leonard Nosferatu (a tribute to F. W. Murnau's film Nosferatu), but Caution is repeatedly told that Nosferatu no longer exists. The Professor himself talks infrequently, referring only vaguely to his hatred for journalists, and offering Caution the chance to join Alphaville, even going so far as to offer him the opportunity to rule a galaxy. When he refuses Caution's offer to go back to \"the outlands\", Caution kills him. Alpha 60 converses with Lemmy Caution several times throughout the film, and its voice is seemingly ever-present in the city, serving as a sort of narrator. Caution eventually destroys or incapacitates it by telling it a riddle that involves something Alpha 60 can not comprehend: poetry (although many of Alpha 60's lines are actually quotations from the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges; the opening line of the film, along with others, is an extract of Borges's essay \"Forms of a Legend\", and other references throughout the movie are made by Alpha 60 to Borges's \"A New Refutation of Time\"). The concept of the individual self has been lost to the collectivized citizens of Alphaville, and this is the key to Caution's riddle. At the end, as Paul Misraki's musical score reaches its climax, Natacha realizes that it is her understanding of herself as an individual with desires that saves her, and destroys Alpha 60. The film ends with her line \"Je vous aime\" (\"I love you\")."

        "content": "Despite its futuristic scenario, Alphaville was filmed entirely in and around Paris and no special sets or props were constructed. Buildings used were the Electricity Board building for the Alpha 60 computer centre and the Hotel Scribe. Constantine came to the film through producer Andr\u00e9 Michelin, who had the actor under contract. Constantine had become a popular actor in France and Germany through his portrayal of tough-guy detective Lemmy Caution in a series of earlier films. Godard appropriated the character for Alphaville but according to director Anne Andreu, Godard's subversion of the Lemmy Caution \"stereotype\" effectively shattered Constantine's connection with the character\u2014he reportedly said that he was shunned by producers after Alphaville was released. Constantine didn't play Lemmy Caution again until Panic Time in 1980. The opening section of the film includes an unedited sequence that depicts Caution walking into his hotel, checking in, riding an elevator and being taken through various corridors to his room. According to cinematographer Raoul Coutard, he and Godard shot this section as a continuous four-minute take. Part of this sequence shows Caution riding an elevator up to his room, which was achieved thanks to the fact that the hotel used as the location had two glass-walled elevators side by side, allowing the camera operator to ride in one lift while filming Constantine riding the other car through the glass between the two. However, as Coutard recalled, this required multiple takes, since the elevators were old and in practice they proved very difficult to synchronize. Like most of Godard's films, the performances and dialogue in Alphaville were substantially improvised. Assistant director Charles Bitsch recalled that, even when production commenced he had no idea what Godard was planning to do. Godard's first act was to ask Bitsch to write a screenplay, saying that producer Michelin had been pestering him for a script because he needed it to help him raise finance from backers in Germany (where Constantine was popular). Bitsch protested that he had never read a Lemmy Caution book, but Godard simply said \"Read one and then write it.\" Bitsch read a Caution book, then wrote a 30-page treatment and brought it to Godard, who said \"OK, fine\" and took it without even looking at it. It was then given to Michelin, who was pleased with the result, and the \"script\" was duly translated into German and sent off to the backers. In fact, none of it even reached the screen and according to Bitsch the German backers later asked Michelin to repay the money when they saw the completed film."

Frequent visitors are Daisy's best friend Twist Morgan and Tim's best friend Mike Watt. The latter ends up becoming a lodger after Marsha's daughter Amber Weary \"flies the nest\". The series largely concerns the surreal and awkward adventures of Tim and Daisy as they navigate through life, come to terms with affairs of the heart, and try to figure out new and largely unproductive ways of killing time. Tim and Daisy repeatedly clarify that they are not a couple to everyone but Marsha, but despite this, romantic tension develops between them, particularly during the second series."

        "content": "The show has a distinctive cinematic style set by Wright and is shot with a single camera. In addition to borrowing liberally from the visual language of film (in particular some kind of unspecified genre films), it has particular stylistic mannerisms, such as the recurring device of scene changes occurring in the middle of a pan. The series' atmosphere is also established by the use of a particular flavour of contemporary dance music on its soundtrack. Northern Exposure's frequent use of fantasy sequences was \"one of the key influences\" in the creation of the show, and Pegg and Stevenson pitched the show to LWT as \"a cross between The Simpsons, The X-Files and Northern Exposure.\" The series is dense with references to popular culture, including but not limited to science fiction and horror films, comic books, and video games.  The Series 2 DVD release introduced the \"Homage-o-meter\", an alternative set of subtitles listing every reference and homage; the \"Definitive Collectors Edition\" boxed set introduced a similar subtitle track for Series 1. 2000 AD artists Jim Murray and Jason Brashill provided the artwork for Tim's comic The Bear, as well as other incidental artwork for the show. Tim's boss Bilbo wears a 2000 AD comic T-shirt whilst lecturing Tim about Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace. The series is also noted for its regular recreational drug use references, from its title onwards. Tim and Daisy smoke Cannabis on a number of occasions, one episode centring on its use. Tim and Mike take speed on one occasion, and it is implied that Tim, Mike, Daisy, Twist and Brian take ecstasy while clubbing."

        "content": "is an action-adventure game developed by Japan Studio and Team Ico, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 in various regions. It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a \"boy meets girl\" concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a \"subtracting design\" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion. The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadowy creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles. Ico introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialogue, bloom lighting, and key frame animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art, original gameplay and story elements and received several awards, including \"Game of the Year\" nominations and three Game Developers Choice Awards. Considered a cult classic, it has been called one of the greatest video games of all time, and is often brought up in discussions about video games as an art form. It has influenced numerous video games since its release. It was rereleased in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with Shadow of the Colossus, the spiritual successor to Ico. A high-definition remaster of the game was released alongside Shadow for the PlayStation 3 in The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection in 2011."

        "content": "Ico is primarily a three-dimensional platform game. The player controls Ico from a third-person perspective as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda. The camera is fixed in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also pan the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings. The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle. These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can jump only short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment. Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open. Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character."

For the past two years, he has attended night school in Boston, learning to read and write from teacher Alice Kinnian. However, his spelling and penmanship remain poor, and he is unable to spell his own name. He works as a janitor in a bakery, where his coworkers frequently amuse themselves at his expense, and enjoys playing with children at a playground when not at work. Alice, who has undertaken doctoral studies, takes Charly to see Dr. Richard Nemur and Dr. Anna Straus, researchers who have increased the intelligence of laboratory mice with a new surgical procedure and are now looking for a human test subject. To assess Charly's suitability as a candidate, they put him through a battery of aptitude tests and have him race against Algernon, a mouse who has had the procedure. Algernon runs through a maze while Charly uses a pencil to trace his way through a diagram of the same maze. Charly consistently loses the races but is nevertheless given the experimental surgery. After the surgery, Charly still loses to Algernon and is initially angry at not immediately becoming smarter. Eventually, he beats Algernon and his intelligence begins to increase rapidly. Charly's coworkers tell him to use a machine that they think is too complex for him to operate, hoping that he will break it so that they can have the day off. When he successfully works the machine, they become displeased that he is now too intelligent to fall for their jokes and get him fired from the bakery. Alice continues teaching him, but he soon surpasses her. Nemur and Straus argue over the importance of Charly's emotional development, with Straus pointing to the drawings and paintings that he has created (including several abstract nude figures of Alice) as evidence of his need to mature. Charly becomes infatuated with Alice and questions whether she loves her fianc\u00e9. He follows her to her apartment one night, declaring his love for her, but flees after she rejects his sexual advances. He rebels by immersing himself in the counterculture \u2013 riding a motorcycle, kissing a series of different women, smoking and dancing \u2013 but eventually returns to Boston. The two reconcile, and both realize that they want to be together and consider marriage. Four weeks later, Nemur and Straus present their research at a convention of scientists, playing back film footage of Charly's aptitude tests before bringing him out for a question-and-answer session. Angry and aggressive at seeing the audience laugh at his past behavior, he allows a brief Q-and-A session during which he explains that humanity has become aimless, soulless, amoral and joyless and that it is rapidly heading toward self-induced extinction. He concludes by revealing that Algernon has died after regressing to his original mental state \u2013 a fact that had been withheld from him \u2013 and that he expects to lose his own enhanced intelligence as well. Charly flees the convention but hallucinates seeing his former self everywhere he goes. Stopping at a bar for a drink, he sees a mentally handicapped busboy drop a tray of glasses; the other customers laugh at the incident but stop when Charly begins to help the busboy clean up the mess. Charly overhears an argument among Alice, Nemur and Straus over the decision to keep Algernon's regression a secret from him and offers to help research the issue. He works with Nemur and Straus in the hope that his intelligence can be saved, but the results indicate that nothing can be done. Alice visits Charly and asks him to marry her, but he refuses and tells her to leave. Some time later, Alice watches Charly playing with children at the playground (as seen at the start of the film), having reverted to his former self."

Driving around in Alonzo's Monte Carlo, they begin the day by catching some college kids buying marijuana. Confiscating their drugs, Alonzo puts it into a pipe and tells Jake to smoke it. When Jake refuses, Alonzo threatens him at gunpoint, stating that refusing like this while on the streets would get him killed. Jake smokes the pipe, and Alonzo tells him that it was laced with PCP. After paying a visit to Roger, an ex-cop turned drug dealer, Jake notices a pair of addicts attempting to rape a teenage girl in an alley. Jake intervenes while Alonzo watches. After the girl leaves and Alonzo scares the addicts off, Jake finds the girl's wallet on the ground and retrieves it. Later, Alonzo and Jake apprehend a dealer named Blue, finding crack rocks and a loaded handgun on him. Rather than go to jail, Blue informs on his employer Kevin \"Sandman\" Miller, who is in prison. Using a fake search warrant, Alonzo steals $40,000 from Sandman's home. At lunch, the two visit Alonzo's mistress Sara and their young son. Alonzo then meets with a trio of corrupt high-ranking police officials he dubs the \"Three Wise Men.\" Aware that the Russian Mafia is hunting Alonzo, they suggest that he skip town. Alonzo insists he has control of the situation, and trades Sandman's drug money for an arrest warrant. Using the warrant, Alonzo, Jake, and four other narcotics officers return to Roger's house and seize $4 million from the premises, a quarter of which Alonzo keeps. Alonzo shoots and kills Roger when Jake refuses to do so, and stages the scene with his men to make the shooting look justified. Infuriated, Jake gets into a Mexican standoff with the corrupt officers; Alonzo (having planned the day's events long in advance) threatens Jake by reminding him of the LAPD's routine blood test, which will identify the PCP-laced cannabis Jake smoked earlier and end his career. Alonzo promises to protect Jake for his cooperation, and Jake is forced to comply. Later that evening, Alonzo drives Jake to the home of a Sure\u00f1o gangster named \"Smiley\" for an errand. Jake reluctantly plays poker with Smiley and his fellow gang members as he waits for Alonzo. As they talk, Smiley reveals Alonzo's situation: by midnight, Alonzo must pay $1 million to the Russians for killing one of their men in Las Vegas, or be killed himself. Realizing that Alonzo abandoned him and has paid Smiley to kill him, Jake attempts to flee but is beaten and dragged to the bathroom to be executed. Before they can kill Jake, a gang member searches him for money and finds the wallet of the teenage girl, who happens to be Smiley's cousin. After calling his cousin and confirming how Jake had saved her, Smiley releases Jake out of gratitude. Jake returns to Sara's apartment to arrest Alonzo, just as he is leaving to pay the Russians with Roger's money. A gunfight and chase ensue, and Alonzo is eventually subdued on the street while the entire neighborhood (which despises Alonzo) gathers to watch. Alonzo offers money to whoever kills Jake, but nobody is interested. Jake then takes the stolen cash, intending to submit it as criminal evidence against Alonzo. The neighborhood gang allows Jake to leave unharmed. Enraged, Alonso threatens to retaliate against the gang members, but the unimpressed gangs ignore him and walk away, knowing that his fate is sealed without the money. Alonzo flees for his life to LAX, but he is ambushed and killed by the Russians. Jake returns home as the press reports on Alonzo's death."

She is bailed out by Jim Johannsen (Sterling Hayden), a younger former actor whom she had helped in the past. Jim, now comfortably settled as the owner of a boatyard, admits that he has loved her ever since those days, and helped by Margaret's daughter Gretchen (Natalie Wood), tries to help Margaret see that her days as a famous actress are already over. She reluctantly tries to work as a saleswoman in an upscale department store, but gossip from two customers wounds her pride and she runs out.  Her old agent manages to get her a screen test for a role in a film she'd always wanted to play. She takes a screen test for a supporting role, believing that if she plays that character as a sexy younger woman, rather than the middle-aged frump she is seen as by the studio, she might be able to win the more coveted lead role. It does not work. At a Hollywood party thrown by her agent, she is offered a role in a new film about a fallen star who can't face the fact that it's all over.

Hearing the pitch delivered right to her face, and that she'd be the perfect actress to play the role, seems to have finally helped Margaret realize the cold truth about her future.

When the consequent moral panic culminates in the United States declaring war on Canada, Stan, Kyle and Cartman take it upon themselves to save Terrance and Phillip from execution, while Kenny tries to prevent a prophecy involving Satan and Saddam Hussein's intent to conquer the world. Primarily centered on themes of censorship and scapegoating, the film also parodies and satirizes the animated films of the Disney Renaissance, musicals such as Les Mis\u00e9rables, and controversies surrounding the series itself. The film also heavily satirizes the Motion Picture Association of America; during production, Parker and Stone disputed with the MPAA, which returned the film multiple times with an NC-17 rating due to its use of profanity. The film's songs were written by Parker and Marc Shaiman, the latter of whom composed the score. South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut premiered at Grauman's Chinese Theater on June 23, 1999 and was released theatrically in North America the following week by Paramount Pictures, with Warner Bros. Pictures handling international distribution. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, soundtrack, humor and themes. Produced on a $21\u00a0million budget, it grossed $83.1\u00a0million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing R-rated animated film until 2016. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the song \"Blame Canada\" was nominated for Best Original Song, but lost to Phil Collins' \"You'll Be in My Heart\" from Tarzan."

        "content": "One morning in South Park, Colorado, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski and his adopted brother Ike, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick visit the movie theater to see Terrance and Phillip's new film, Asses of Fire. When they are denied tickets to the R-rated film, the boys pay a homeless man to accompany them. After watching the film, the boys begin swearing constantly. Their friends are impressed and also decide to see the film, except for Wendy Testaburger, who becomes acquainted with transfer student Gregory, to Stan's jealousy. When the children's parents find out, they are forbidden from seeing the film again, but do so multiple times. As a bet with Cartman, Kenny sets his fart on fire, imitating a scene from the film; he accidentally immolates himself and is rushed to the hospital, where he dies from a botched heart transplant. Barred from Heaven, Kenny descends into Hell, wherein he encounters Satan and his abusive partner Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, Kyle's mother, Sheila, forms the Mothers Against Canada (M.A.C.) movement with other parents. Terrance and Phillip are arrested as war criminals; when the United States refuses to release them, Canada bombs the Baldwins in retaliation. The US declares war on Canada and arranges to have Terrance and Phillip executed during a USO show. After insulting Sheila, Cartman is implanted with a V-chip, which administers an electric shock whenever he swears. Satan prophesies that the war is a sign of the apocalypse and upon Terrance and Phillip's deaths, he will invade and conquer Earth. After failing to persuade Satan to abandon Saddam, Kenny's ghost visits Cartman to warn him. Unable to reason with their mothers, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman form a resistance movement with their classmates to rescue Terrance and Phillip. At Gregory's behest, they recruit the French-accented, misotheistic Cristophe, nicknamed \"the Mole.\" Kyle later hides Ike in their family's attic as Canadians are sent to internment camps. After they infiltrate the show, Stan and Kyle are tasked with stalling the execution, while Cartman attempts to deactivate the alarm as the Mole prepares to secure Terrance and Phillip. However, Kenny's ghost reappears before Cartman, frightening him into forgetting his task. The Mole is discovered and fatally mauled by guard dogs. The remaining boys try to warn their mothers about Satan's prophecy, but are ignored as the execution commences. The execution is interrupted when Canada launches a surprise attack, resulting in a massive battle between the two armies. Cartman deactivates the electrical switch, allowing Terrance and Phillip to escape; the shock from the switch causes his V-chip to malfunction. Stan chases after them, but is knocked out in an explosion. Members of M.A.C., horrified at what they incited, decide to abandon their cause, with only Sheila remaining committed. Stan reawakens before a sentient clitoris, who tells him to be self-confident to gain Wendy's affection. Stan leads the others to Terrance and Phillip, whom the US Army have cornered. The children form a human shield as Kyle tries to reason with Sheila, faulting her for scapegoating others for his mistakes. While the soldiers begin to back down, Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip dead, fulfilling Satan's prophecy. Saddam usurps Satan and demands that everyone bow to him. When Saddam insults Cartman, the latter's retort releases bolts of energy from his hands. Subsequently, Cartman engages in profanity-laden tirades to attack Saddam, who continues to verbally abuse Satan. Satan becomes enraged and throws Saddam back into Hell, where he is impaled on a stalagmite. Grateful for Kenny's support, Satan grants him one wish. Kenny wishes for everything to return to a pre-war state, and parts with his friends before disappearing. South Park is restored as the casualties, including Terrance and Phillip, are undone. As Americans and Canadians make peace, Sheila reconciles with Kyle, as does Wendy with Stan. For his sacrifice, Kenny is allowed entry into Heaven."

        "content": "The Fast and the Furious is a 2001 action film directed by Rob Cohen from a screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, with the story credited to Thompson. It is the first installment in the Fast & Furious franchise and stars Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny Strong, and Ted Levine. In the film, Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop, is tasked with discovering the identities of a group of automobile hijackers led by Dominic Toretto. Preparations for The Fast and the Furious began after Cohen was introduced to illegal street racing in May 1998, with the screenplay originally developed by Thompson and Bergquist; Walker and Diesel were cast in late 1999, and Diesel contributed to script rewrites with Ayer as the rest of the cast was finalized. The production attended illegal street races, and is notable for its inclusion of street racers. After setting an initial release date for March 2001, principal photography began in July 2000 and lasted until that October, with filming locations including Los Angeles and southern California. The Fast and the Furious was theatrically released in the United States on June 22, 2001, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the performances of Walker and Diesel and the action sequences, but criticism for its storyline and the ending. The film grossed over $200 million worldwide, becoming the 19th highest-grossing film of 2001. It launched a franchise starting with the sequel film 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), which then led to an industry of tie-in products, including video games, amusement park attractions, and spin-off works, and merchandise including toys and clothing. The Fast and the Furious was reissued in a limited release in June 2016, to commemorate its fifteenth anniversary."

        "content": "On a deserted highway, a heist crew driving three modified Honda Civics assault a truck carrying electronic goods, steal its cargo, and escape into the night. The following day, a joint Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and FBI task force sends LAPD officer Brian O'Conner undercover to locate the crew. He begins his investigation at Toretto's Market and flirts with its owner Mia, sister of the infamous street racer Dominic Toretto, while Dominic sits in the back office reading a newspaper. Dominic's crew, Vince, Leon, Jesse, and his girlfriend Letty, arrives. Vince, who has a crush on Mia, starts a fight with Brian until Dominic intervenes. That night, Brian brings a modified 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse to an illegal street race, hoping to find a lead on the heist crew. Dominic arrives in his Mazda RX-7 and initiates a drag race between himself, Brian and two other drivers. Lacking funds, Brian is forced to wager his car. Dominic wins the race after Brian's car malfunctions, but the LAPD arrive before he can hand over his vehicle. Brian, in his car, helps Dominic escape, but they accidentally venture into the territory of Dominic's old racing rival, gang leader Johnny Tran and his cousin Lance Nguyen, who destroy Brian's vehicle. Dominic reiterates that Brian still owes him a \"10 second car\". Brian brings a damaged 1994 Toyota Supra to Dominic's garage as a replacement. Dominic and his crew begin the long process of restoring the vehicle, and Brian starts dating Mia. He also begins investigating Tran, convinced that he is the mastermind behind the truck hijackings. While investigating one garage at night, Brian is discovered by Dominic and Vince. Brian convinces them that he is researching his opponents' vehicles for the upcoming desert Race Wars. Together, the trio investigate Tran's garage, discovering a large quantity of electronic goods. Brian reports the discovery to his superiors and Tran and Lance are arrested. The electronics are proved to have been purchased legally, and Brian is forced to confront his suspicion that Dominic is the true mastermind. Brian is given 36 hours to find the heist crew, as the truckers are now arming themselves to defend against the hijackings. The following day, Dominic and Brian attend Race Wars. There, Jesse wagers his father's MK3 Volkswagen Jetta against Tran in his Honda S2000, but flees with the car after he loses. Tran demands Dominic recover the vehicle. That night, Brian witnesses Dominic and his crew leaving and realizes they are the hijackers. He reveals his true identity to Mia and convinces her to help him find the crew. Dominic, Letty, Vince, and Leon attack a semi-trailer truck, intending it to be their final heist. The armed driver shoots Vince and runs Letty off the road. Brian arrives with Mia and rescues Vince. He is forced to reveal his identity to call in emergency medical care to save Vince. Dominic, Mia and the rest of the crew leave before the authorities can arrive. Some time later, Brian arrives at Dominic's house to apprehend him as he is getting his father's 1970 Dodge Charger R/T out of the garage. He demands Brian leave, since he is not running, but is going to rescue Jesse who has no one else to look after him. Instead Jesse arrives at his house and pleads for protection. Tran and Lance ride by on motorbikes and shoot Jesse dead. Brian and Dominic give chase in their separate vehicles, finding and killing Tran and injuring Lance. Brian then pursues Dominic, with them both eventually acquiescing to a quarter-mile drag race. The pair barely cross a railroad before a train passes, which ends the race in a draw, but Dominic crashes his car into a truck. Instead of arresting him, Brian gives Dominic the keys to his own car, asserting that he still owes him a 10-second car from their first race. Dominic leaves in the Supra as Brian walks away. In the post-credits scene, Dominic is seen driving through Baja California, Mexico, in a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS."

        "content": "After nearly being caught on a routine burglary, master safe-cracker Nick Wells decides the time has finally come to retire from his criminal activities. He shares this idea with his girlfriend Diane, offering to live together and open a legitimate restaurant. He is enticed into taking one final score by his fence Max. The job, worth a $4 million payoff to Nick, is to steal a sceptre, a French national treasure stored in the ultra-secure basement of the Montr\u00e9al Customs House. The sceptre was discovered by Customs agents being smuggled into Canada. Max introduces Nick to Jack Teller, an ambitious thief who has infiltrated the Customs House and gained security information by pretending to be a mentally-challenged janitor. The plot includes the initial distrust from Nick towards Jack, and their settlement in order to do the job. After agreeing with Max that Nick is in charge of the operation, and making a truce between them, they begin working together to build a plan and to find access to the Customs House basement. The plot also includes the disappointment of Nick's girlfriend, Diane, due to Nick's motives to do this last score (have enough money to get full ownership of his Jazz Club, and to have a comfortable life with Diane), after she happily agreed to start a new life with him. She leaves Nick disappointed and reconsiders their ongoing relationship. Another complication arises as Jack is not able to get the codes for the Security System of the Customs House. Nick then seeks help from a trusted associate, Steven, a computer hacker who has worked with Nick on past jobs. Steven hacks into the Custom House's security system to obtain the bypass codes so they can temporarily manipulate the alert protocols of the system during the heist. He is caught, however, by a corrupt systems administrator of the Security company (Ironclad) who extorts Nick for $50,000 in order to give them the information. The exchange of money and codes is made at a public park, at the corrupt administrator's request, and a tense moment involving guns arises, while Jack, Nick and Steven confirm the codes in real time, using a radio and a cell phone to communicate between them. After this event, Nick firmly orders Jack not to carry a gun again ever, even if it helped control the situation at the park. One more complication appears as Nick discovers the safe cannot be opened, using the tools and procedures he masters, so he needs to find a way to open it within the short time frame allowed by the schedule planned for the night of the heist. After seeing an accident in the street involving a beer keg being opened by the pressure of the liquid inside, Nicks figures a way to open the safe. The day after this, at his secret workshop, Nick explains how he will open the safe to Jack. Nick tells Jack that, after the score, Jack must remain in his job so no suspicions arise regarding who planned the job, and Jack must also wait for his share of the money after Nick and Max finish the transaction with the final buyer. At first Jack does not agree to these terms and insists on being present during the rest of the transaction with Max, but Nick pushes his decision so Jack reluctantly agrees to follow Nick's orders. A few days before the score, Nick and Jack have a conversation in Nick's Jazz Club, where Nick advises Jack to make a list of goals, and to take life slow and smartly, in order to achieve them. After this, Nick abruptly ends the conversation and goes to meet Diane, who is visiting him at the Jazz Club, while Jack observes their encounter at a distance. Still yet another complication arises when they are forced to move up their timetable after the Customs House becomes aware of the sceptre's value and adds extra closed-circuit television cameras and infrared detectors to monitor the basement room while preparing to return it to its rightful owners. At this point, Nick feels the job is too risky after all these complications and wants to pull out, but Max implores him to do it so he can pay a mafia boss the 4 million Max owes him. Nick reluctantly agrees to continue and finishes the details of the plan with Jack at a restaurant. The night of the score, Nick uses a sewer tunnel to enter the Customs House basement as Jack rigs the cameras to shut off when Nick enters the storage room. A fellow janitor stumbles upon Jack, who locks the janitor in a closet. Nick fills the enormous in-floor safe containing the sceptre with water before inserting and detonating a depth charge to blow off the door. He quickly packs up the sceptre in a carrying case to depart, but Jack double crosses him and at gunpoint demands he hand it over. Nick reluctantly gives up the carrying case and seconds later the alarm, rigged by Jack, alerts the entire security staff to the heist. Nick darts for the sewer entrance he came in through as Jack heads back upstairs, tucking the carrying case inside his janitor jumpsuit and slipping past the incoming police units responding to the burglary. Nick escapes the security guards chasing him through the sewer tunnels. After making it to a bus station to flee the city, Jack calls Nick to gloat, and says Nick should have shown him respect and shouldn't have forced him to play second fiddle during the job since he was the one who brought the job to Max, but he is shocked to discover that Nick anticipated Jack's actions. Jack opens the carrying case Nick gave him and finds it contains a steel rod weighed down with various bushings they used during the planning of the job. Brushing off Jack's threats of vengeance, Nick advises Jack to flee as \"every cop in the city\" will now be looking for him. Nick hangs up and boards a boat with the real sceptre as a shocked Jack broods over his situation. Later, Max smiles as he watches a news broadcast reporting a massive manhunt being organized to find Jack, the prime suspect, and an unidentified accomplice. Nick then meets his girlfriend Diane at Montreal Mirabel International airport as she returns from work, and they embrace."

Jonathan doesn't have any, so Skip gives him a set from his dresser. They head out of the dorm together until they get to the final door where Skip stays behind and locks the door. The other students begin to laugh and mock Jonathan for wearing girls' underwear. Mortified, Jonathan tries to get back inside. After discovering all the doors are locked, he climbs a trellis leading into his room where he finds Skip rolling on the floor laughing. Skip tries to tell Jonathan it was just a practical joke and to just laugh it off, but Jonathan is too embarrassed. Later, during lunchtime in the cafeteria, the other students again taunt Jonathan as he tries to eat. When Skip invites him over to his table to sit with him and his friends, Jonathan turns to reveal that he is crying. Skip is now deeply remorseful for pulling the prank on Jonathan as he flees the cafeteria. When Skip returns to their room to apologize to Jonathan, he finds him hanging with a rope around his neck in an apparent suicide. Going to get help, on his return to the room, Skip and the gathering crowd find not Jonathan but a mannequin with a picture of the dean's face attached to its head. The crowd begins to crack up hysterically at Skip as the dean says he wants to see him and Jonathan in his office. As the crowd disperses, Skip finds Jonathan very much alive and laughing hysterically in the closet. He grudgingly accepts the prank reversal and they become fast friends. Afterwards they share secrets, and Jonathan confesses he cheated on the SAT. After several failed attempts to find Jonathan a date, Skip vows to help him have a successful sexual encounter. He sends Jonathan to Chicago to gain sexual experience before their reputations are ruined. He is picked up by Ellen, a beautiful older woman, and begins an affair with her.

Suffield House, a private mansion in Lake Forest, played the part of Skip Burroughs' family estate, given the fictitious address of 65 Spring Creek Road, Barrington Hills. Bisset replaced Lesley Ann Warren for the role of Ellen Burroughs. Bisset was disappointed that scenes involving her character's backstory were cut. These included a scene at the end where her son visited her in a mental hospital. \"When you're in a comedy ... It's always difficult to develop a character because they always cut for comedy, the comic effect. I lost a couple of scenes that would have explained my character better. She was more interesting in the original script. Why does she do what she does? She's a very unhappy woman. She doesn't have any relationship at home. Cliff tells her in the bedroom that she's a Burrows and as long as she's a Burrows she must behave. That's not much of a relationship to have with your husband. So she's a bit off balance, greatly in need of a childlike component in her life. She's been completely buckled down by Cliff. There's absolutely no fantasy aspect to her life. She's condemned to being an adult... The director sees it much more as a rites-of-passage film\", Bisset said. McCarthy attended an open call held at New York University and wound up with the lead part in the film. Lowe said, \"It was a very atypical role for me. So it's a little uncomfortable when I'm too readily associated with it. 'Oh yeah, him, he was in Class.' It was such an extroverted role, and most of my work has been just the opposite. I like the movie. I think it was fun, not the vile concoction a lot of people seem to think it was.\" Madsen dislikes talking about her experience making the film, stating in a 2013 interview, \"Those guys were assholes. They were really shitty to me. It was bad. Bad memories.\" Rob Lowe said her comment was justifiable, pointing out \"her big part in that movie required her shirt to get ripped off, and looking back, it couldn't be a more egregious, vintage, lowbrow, 1980s Porky's-esque, shoehorned-in moment... I can imagine it was not much fun to do that big sequence with a bunch of laughing, ogling frat-boy actors.

Because there were no visual communications at that time, the two races have never seen each other. While Kirk officiates at the wedding of Lieutenant Tomlinson and Ensign Martine, Outpost 4 comes under attack. The Enterprise comes to Outpost 4's aid and contacts the base commander, Hansen, who reveals he is the only survivor of an attack by an unknown enemy. As they speak, the enemy ship reappears, fires, and disappears. The shot destroys the outpost and kills Hansen. The ship's sensors locate the attacker, which remains invisible. Kirk surmises that the attacker is equipped with a cloaking device. A coded message from the intruder provides a view through one of its internal cameras, revealing humanoids with an appearance like Vulcans. Lieutenant Stiles, the navigator, son of a service family that lost several members in the Earth\u2013Romulan War, begins to question the loyalty of the Enterprise first officer, Mr. Spock. During a discussion of the Romulan ship's capabilities, Stiles suggests the Enterprise attack before it can reach the Neutral Zone. Spock agrees; he reasons that if the Romulans are in fact an offshoot of the Vulcan species and have retained the martial philosophy of the Vulcans' ancient past, they would surely take advantage of any perceived weakness. A cat-and-mouse game ensues. The Enterprise is faster and more maneuverable, while the Romulan ship has a cloaking device and immensely destructive plasma torpedoes. However, the range of these torpedoes is limited, and firing one requires so much power that the ship must decloak first. After several attacks, the Romulans, almost beaten, plant a nuclear weapon amidst jettisoned debris. When Spock detects a \"metal-cased object\", Kirk orders a point-blank phaser shot that detonates the device. The Enterprise is shaken by the blast and many of the phaser crew are incapacitated, requiring Stiles to fill in. Kirk orders operations to work at minimal power to exaggerate the apparent damage and lure the Romulans in for a kill shot. Although the Romulan commander suspects Kirk's trap, Decius, a politically well-connected member of the command crew pressures him to attack. When the Romulan ship decloaks to launch a torpedo, Kirk tries to spring his trap, but a coolant leak in the phaser control room incapacitates Stiles and Tomlinson. Spock rescues Stiles and fires the phasers, mortally wounding the Romulan ship. Kirk hails the Romulans and at last communicates directly with his opponent, offering to beam aboard survivors. The Romulan commander tells Kirk that he regrets having met him in combat, that \"You and I are of a kind. In a different reality, I could have called you friend.\" He declines Kirk's offer to take off his crew, telling the Captain that it is not the Romulan way to be taken prisoner. The Commander then triggers his ship's self-destruct system. Enterprise's only fatality is Lt. Tomlinson. Kirk goes to the chapel to offer comfort to a grieving Ensign Martine."

Director Vincent McEveety had seen the 1957 film The Enemy Below but only noticed the similarities between its plot and this episode later. He admitted \"Obviously, it's the same story.\" The music played during the opening scene of the wedding ceremony is the 19th century English song \"Long, Long Ago.\" Fans of a certain age may remember it as \"Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree (With Anyone Else But Me)\", which, with updated lyrics, became a hit for both the Glenn Miller Orchestra and The Andrews Sisters during World War II. The term photon torpedo  was only invented for a later episode \"Arena\", but the same effect was used in this one although still called phaser.

A landing party consisting of Captain Kirk, Doctor Leonard McCoy, Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, and historian Lieutenant Marla McGivers beams over to the freighter. The landing party finds a cargo of 84 humans, 72 of whom are alive in suspended animation after nearly 200\u00a0years, the other 12 having perished during the journey. McGivers identifies the group's leader, who begins to revive and is taken back to the Enterprise for a medical examination. Kirk has Botany Bay taken in tow by a tractor beam, and Enterprise sets course for Starbase\u00a012. In sickbay, the group's leader awakens and introduces himself as \"Khan\". McGivers marvels over Khan, a living relic from the 20th century, her field of interest. First Officer Spock discovers that their guest is actually Khan Noonien Singh, who, along with his people, are products of 20th-century selective breeding designed to create perfect humans. The genetic superhumans instead became tyrants and conquered more than a third of the planet during the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s. Khan is placed under guard in quarters. McGivers is sent to brief him on current events. Taking advantage of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over Enterprise. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to Botany Bay, where he revives the rest of his people. They return to Enterprise and take control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression chamber, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his people. Khan escapes the gas and goes to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy Enterprise, but Kirk confronts him; they fight and Kirk knocks Khan unconscious. Kirk holds a hearing to decide the fate of Khan and his people. Kirk exiles them to Ceti Alpha V, a harsh world that he believes would be a perfect place for Khan to \"tame\". Khan accepts, citing Milton's Paradise Lost. Instead of a court-martial for McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that it would be interesting to see what Khan makes of Ceti Alpha V in 100 years."

        "title": "Space Seed_Writing",
        "content": "Carey Wilber was hired to write a script for an episode of Star Trek. His idea was based on an episode he wrote for the television series Captain Video and His Video Rangers (1949\u20131955). His work on that show featured Ancient Greek-era humans transported in suspended animation through space, with the people of the future finding that they have mythological powers. For \"Space Seed\", Wilber replaced these mythological powers with abilities that were enhanced due to genetic engineering. Wilber had briefly worked with Gene Roddenberry on the television series Harbormaster. His science fiction extended beyond Star Trek: he also wrote scripts for Lost in Space and The Time Tunnel around the same time. The script changed numerous times during preproduction as producer Bob Justman felt that it would be too expensive to film. Eventually Gene L. Coon and series creator Gene Roddenberry also made alterations. In Wilber's first proposal for the story that became \"Space Seed\", dated August 29, 1966 (shortly before the first episode of Star Trek aired) the villain was Harold Erickson, an ordinary criminal exiled into space. He sought to free his gang from Botany Bay, seize Enterprise, and become a pirate. Parts of the story were inspired by the use of penal colonies in the 18th century, and characterizations were based on descriptions from the series' writer's bible. As a result, several elements of the draft differed from how the characters behaved in the series; for example, the draft includes a scene where Spock defeats Kirk at chess by cheating. Producer Gene L. Coon told Wilber that his work was the best outline he had seen during his time on Star Trek. Fellow producer Bob Justman was less enthusiastic; he compared it negatively to Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, and felt the concept would be too expensive to film. There were also concerns that an unsolicited script submitted by science fiction author Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer resembled the proposed plot which, as Roddenberry had corresponded with Farmer, might lead to litigation. NBC executives reviewed the plot for \"Space Seed\" and approved it, but Justman reassessed the outline, saying that it needed to be heavily revised. In September, Wilber was given a list of suggested changes including asking him to remove any mention of the setting, as the producers did not want to say how far in the future Star Trek was set, and to remove the chess scene. Wilber submitted a second draft, but Roddenberry still had problems with basic elements of the script. He did not believe common criminals would be fired into space as a solution and strongly disliked the notion of space pirates. The second draft introduced the idea that Kirk marooned Erickson and his crew on a new planet; this remained in the final version. Wilber was not asked for a third draft; Coon was tasked with the re-write; he submitted it on December 7 and updated it twice over the following five days. Wilber accepted Coon's re-writes, and left the staff after the submission of his second draft as his contractual obligations were complete. Coon proposed that Erickson should be a rival to Kirk, a genetic superman who had once ruled part of Earth. Roddenberry and Justman were still unhappy with the script, and Roddenberry revised it once more a week before filming was due to begin, after Montalb\u00e1n had been cast. In this draft the blond Nordic character of Erickson became closer to the version seen on screen. In Roddenberry and Coon's script, the character was renamed Sibahl Khan Noonien. The name Govin Bahadur Singh was suggested by the DeForest Research company, who checked scripts for potential errors on behalf of the production company; the Singh name was suggested in part because it was closer to actual Sikh names. Coon and Roddenberry settled on Khan Noonien Singh; Roddenberry had an old Chinese friend named Noonien Wang that he had lost touch with, and hoped that Wang would see the episode and contact him. In the final draft, Roddenberry listed himself as the primary writer, Coon as co-writer and Wilber was absent, but the Writers Guild of America turned down Roddenberry's request to be credited; Coon received the main credit; Wilber was given co-writer and \"story-by\" credits. Wilber did not often watch his own work, and nearly thirty years later had never seen \"Space Seed\". Coon was later credited as Lee Cronin for his part in production of the script."

Kirk appeals to Ayelborne, the head of the local council to allow the Federation to help them resist Klingon occupation, but the Organians adamantly oppose any use of violence. When a Klingon fleet appears in orbit, Kirk orders the Enterprise to withdraw, which strands himself and Spock on the planet. Ayelborne disguises Kirk and Spock to avoid suspicion and the Klingons seize control of the planet without resistance, installing the ranking Klingon officer, Kor, as the military governor. Kor has Spock questioned with a \"mind sifter\" device to confirm he is not a spy and designates Kirk as the Organian civilian liaison with the occupation force. Spock uses his mental discipline to withstand the scrutiny of the device. That evening, in an attempt to inspire the Organians, Spock and Kirk sabotage a munitions dump outside the town. Ayelborne reveals the true identities of the Federation officers to Kor. He and the council then mysteriously free the two before the Klingons can torture information out of them. While Kirk and Spock try to comprehend the council's contradictory actions, Kor orders the execution of two hundred Organians, yet the council seems unmoved. As the Federation and Klingon fleets ready themselves for a confrontation in the system, Kirk and Spock raid the Klingon headquarters in hopes of rousing the population into resistance. They capture Kor and prepare to make a last stand. The Organians then reveal their true nature: they are highly advanced incorporeal beings.

Commander Dexter Remmick (Robert Schenkkan) aboard the Enterprise. For classified reasons, Quinn has ordered Remmick to perform an investigation of the Enterprise and its crew and expects Picard to fully co-operate. Remmick's inquiry causes tension in the crew, particularly when he questions the trustworthiness of the senior staff based on their personal logs and past actions. A young cadet, having failed the Starfleet Academy entrance examination, attempts to run away in a shuttlecraft but ends up drifting. Picard is able to direct the cadet to pilot the shuttle away from a planet by bouncing off the atmosphere. The investigation is completed, and Remmick informs both Picard and Quinn that there is no sign of wrongdoing, and expresses his interest in joining its crew in the future. Quinn tells Picard that he feels there is an unknown force that has infiltrated Starfleet, and he was seeking to assure himself of his trust in Picard and the Enterprise crew. To help combat this threat, Quinn offers Picard a promotion to Admiral and a job overseeing Starfleet Academy which would place Picard near Quinn at all times. Picard mulls the offer for some time, but eventually declines. Meanwhile, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) prepares to take the Academy entrance exam himself. He succeeds in passing several parts of the exam, and helps Mordock (John Putch), a highly talented Benzite and fellow competitor, to solve a difficult test problem so that they may both advance. Wesley is worried about the psychological part of the exam, and he is directed to a room to wait for the test to start. While waiting, he hears an explosion nearby, and leaves the room to investigate. He finds two men trapped by fallen components in a fire-engulfed room. Wesley helps to release one man wounded under a heavy pipe, and tries to coax the other man to leave the burning room, but the man is frozen with fear. Wesley is forced to abandon him and drags the other man to safety. Outside the room, he discovers the explosion was fake and this was the psychological test: to see whether he could make a difficult decision in circumstances reminiscent of those that killed his father. (Rescuing either man would pass the test.) Eventually, the cadets are told of the results, and Mordock is granted admission into Starfleet Academy, while Wesley is encouraged to try again next year. Mordock thanks Wesley for his help and wishes him future success. After Wesley returns to the Enterprise, Picard confides in him that he also failed the examination the first time."

Numerous make-up effects were created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore, including an exploding head using raw meat. There were concerns by producers that some of the effects were too graphic, but after a viewing by a staff member's son, they decided to broadcast it uncut.

Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using is supposed to be a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command in the past six months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon investigating this, the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the conspiracy theory, and orders the Enterprise to Earth. As it approaches Earth, the Enterprise receives no response from Starfleet Command. Eventually, a transmission is received from a trio of Starfleet admirals: Savar (Henry Darrow), Aaron (Ray Reinhardt) and Quinn (Ward Costello), an old friend of Picard's who recently made an inspection of the Enterprise (in \"Coming of Age\"). They are surprised by the Enterprises presence, but invite Captain Picard and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) to dinner. Quinn requests to beam aboard the Enterprise for a tour. Captain Picard recalls being warned by Quinn about some kind of threat to Starfleet when the admiral was last aboard. Upon Quinn's arrival, Picard discusses matters with him and Quinn seems strangely evasive; Picard comes to believe that he is an impostor, or under some sort of alien influence. After warning Riker of his concerns and asking him to watch Quinn, the captain beams down to Starfleet headquarters to attend the dinner. On arrival, Picard is greeted by the other two Admirals who are accompanied by Quinn's assistant, Lt. Commander Remmick (Robert Schenkkan). Meanwhile, Riker visits Quinn's quarters on the Enterprise and questions him about what he has in the small box he brought with him. Quinn tells Riker of a superior life form within the box. Riker attempts to leave but Quinn throws Riker across the room. A security team arrives to subdue Quinn, who is able to withstand a great amount of phaser-fire before he collapses. The ship's chief medical officer, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), finds a small protrusion on the back of his neck. She discovers that a bug-like parasite has wrapped its tendrils around the stem of Quinn's brain and is controlling him. Dr. Crusher warns Picard of this incident when he contacts the ship in private. He is advised that the infected person can only be stopped by a phaser set to 'kill': the captain points out that he is unarmed. He then has no choice but to go in to dinner with his three superiors. A bowl of living larvae is served at the meal, to Picard's disgust. He attempts to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears to be controlled by the parasite Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic protrusion on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is about to put a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed. Later, Dr. Crusher reports that the other parasites, including the one inside Quinn, have shriveled up and died, as they were unable to survive without the mother-creature that had been inhabiting Remmick. As they help to settle matters with Starfleet headquarters, they find that before Remmick was killed, he had sent a signal to a distant quadrant of the galaxy. The signal is thought to be a homing beacon."

        "content": "Gene Roddenberry originated the idea for the episode in a single-sentence proposal entitled \"The Assassins\". Robert Sabaroff expanded this idea to thirty pages, but his version was seen as too expensive. Tracy Torm\u00e9 was then given the job of rewriting it, but some producers thought the new version was too dark until Roddenberry saw it and endorsed the new version. In one of the original versions, it was a faction within Starfleet who were conspirators rather than alien parasites, but Roddenberry did not like showing Starfleet itself in such a dark manner. Wired magazine has suggested that the premise was based on the Iran\u2013Contra affair. The director of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick at the end of the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included. Several props and effects seen in the episode were reproduced from the Star Trek movies, including the shots of Earth and Spacedock One and the painting used of Starfleet Command. The doors to the room where dinner is served were later reused from season 2 onwards on the set for Ten-Forward. The episode also features two first appearances; the Ambassador class starship was mentioned for the first time (the Horatio was a member of this class, as was the Enterprise-C) and it also marks the first time that a Bolian had been seen on Star Trek, the species having been named after the episode's director. Although the parasites never appeared again on screen in any Star Trek series, they reappear in the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels, where they are revealed to be mutated Trill symbionts. They also reappear in several episodes of the game Star Trek Online. The parasites, known as Bluegill, are bio-engineered by the Solanae on behalf of the Iconians. They are not capable of infecting a joined Trill."

It portrays would-be rubber baron Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, an Irishman known in Peru as Fitzcarraldo, who is determined to transport a steamship over a steep hill to access a rich rubber territory in the Amazon Basin. The film is derived from the historic events of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fitzcarrald and his real-life feat of transporting a disassembled steamboat over the Isthmus of Fitzcarrald. The film had a troubled production, and the documentary Burden of Dreams chronicled the film's hardships. Herzog forced his crew to manually haul the 320-ton steamship up a steep hill, leading to three injuries. The film's original star Jason Robards became sick halfway through filming, so Herzog hired Kinski, with whom he had previously clashed violently during production of Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Nosferatu the Vampyre and Woyzeck. Their fourth partnership fared no better. When shooting was nearly complete, the chief of the Machiguenga tribe who were used extensively as extras, asked Herzog if they should kill Kinski for him.

He has an indomitable spirit, but is little more than a dreamer with one major failure already behind him \u2013 the bankrupted and incomplete Trans-Andean railways. A lover of opera and a great fan of the internationally known Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, he dreams of building an opera house in Iquitos. Numerous Europeans and North African Sephardic Jewish immigrants have settled in the city at this time, bringing their cultures with them. The opera house will require considerable amounts of money, which the booming rubber industry in Peru should yield in profits. The areas in the Amazon Basin known to contain rubber trees have been parceled up by the Peruvian government and are leased to private companies for exploitation. Fitzcarraldo explores entering the rubber business. A helpful rubber baron points out on a map the only remaining unclaimed parcel in the area. He explains that while it is located on the Ucayali River, a major tributary of the Amazon, it is cut off from the Amazon (and access to Atlantic ports) by a lengthy section of rapids. Fitzcarraldo sees that the Pachitea River, another Amazon tributary, comes within several hundred meters of the Ucayali upstream of the parcel. He plans to investigate that. He leases the inaccessible parcel from the government. His paramour, Molly, a successful brothel owner, funds his purchase of an old steamship (which he christens the SS Molly Aida). After recruiting a crew, he takes off up the Pachitea, the parallel river. This river has dangerous interior areas because of its indigenous people hostile to outsiders. Fitzcarraldo plans to go to the closest point between the two rivers and, with the manpower of impressed natives (who are nearly enslaved by many rubber companies), physically pull his three-deck, 320-ton steamer over the muddy 40\u00b0 hillside across a portage from one river to the next. Using the steamer, he will collect rubber produced on the upper Ucayali and bring it down the Pachitea and the Amazon to market at Atlantic ports. The majority of the ship's crew, at first unaware of Fitzcarraldo's plan, abandon the expedition soon after entering indigenous territory, leaving only the captain, engineer, and cook. Impressed by Fitzcarraldo and his ship, the natives start working for him without fully understanding his goals. After great struggles, they successfully pull the ship over the mountain with a complex system of pulleys, worked by the natives and aided by the ship's anchor windlass. When the crew falls asleep after a drunken celebration, the chief of the natives severs the rope securing the ship to the shore. It floats down the river. The chief wanted to appease the river gods, who would otherwise be angered that Fitzcarraldo defied nature by circumventing them. Though the ship traverses the Ucayali rapids without major damage, Fitzcarraldo and his crew are forced to return to Iquitos without any rubber. Despondent, Fitzcarraldo sells the ship back to the rubber baron, but first sends the captain on a last voyage. He returns with the entire cast for the first opera production, including Caruso. The entire city of Iquitos comes to the shore as Fitzcarraldo, standing on top of the ship, proudly displays the cast."

        "content": "The story was inspired by the historical figure of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald. In the 1890s, Fitzcarrald arranged for the transport of a steamship across an isthmus from one river into another, but it weighed only 30 tons (rather than over 300), and was carried over in pieces to be reassembled at its destination. In his autobiographical film Portrait Werner Herzog, Herzog said that he concentrated in Fitzcarraldo on the physical effort of transporting the ship, partly inspired by the engineering feats of ancient standing stones. The film production was an incredible ordeal, and famously involved moving a 320-ton steamship over a hill. This was filmed without the use of special effects. Herzog believed that no one had ever performed a similar feat in history, and likely never will again, calling himself \"Conquistador of the Useless\". Three similar-looking ships were bought for the production and used in different scenes and locations, including scenes that were shot aboard the ship while it crashed through rapids. The most violent scenes in the rapids were shot with a model of the ship.  Three of the six people involved in the filming were injured during this passage. Casting of the film was difficult. Jason Robards was originally cast in the title role, but he became ill with dysentery during early filming. After leaving for treatment, he was forbidden by his doctors to return. Herzog considered casting Jack Nicholson, or playing the role of Fitzcarraldo himself, before Klaus Kinski accepted the role. Herzog had done considerable film work with Kinski. By that point, forty percent of shooting with Robards was complete. For continuity, Herzog had to begin a total reshoot with Kinski. Mick Jagger as Fitzcarraldo's assistant Wilbur and Mario Adorf as the Ship's captain were originally cast, but due to the delays, their shooting schedule expired. Jagger parted to tour with the Rolling Stones. Herzog dropped Jagger's character from the script altogether as he reshot the film from the beginning. Brazilian actor Grande Otelo and singer Milton Nascimento play minor parts. Kinski displayed erratic behavior throughout the production, and fought virulently with Herzog and other members of the crew. A scene from Herzog's documentary of the actor, My Best Fiend, shows Kinski raging at production manager Walter Saxer over trivial matters, such as the quality of the food. Herzog notes that the native extras were greatly upset by the actor's behavior. Kinski claimed to feel close to them. In My Best Fiend, Herzog says that one of the native chiefs offered in all seriousness to kill Kinski for him, but that he declined because he needed the actor to complete filming. According to Herzog, he exploited these tensions: in a scene in which the ship's crew is eating dinner while surrounded by the natives, the clamor the chief incites over Fitzcarraldo was inspired by their hatred of Kinski. Locations used for the film include: Manaus, Brazil; Iquitos, Peru; Pongo de Mainique, Peru; an isthmus between the Urubamba and the Camisea rivers, Peru at -11.737294,-72.934542, 36 miles west of the actual historical fiction, the Isthmus of Fitzcarrald. Herzog's first version of the story was published as Fitzcarraldo: The Original Story (1982) from Fjord Press (). He made alterations while writing the screenplay."

        "content": "In 1977 Azusa, California, Rocky Dennis, who suffers from craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, is accepted without question by his freewheeling biker mother's boyfriends, his \"extended motorcycle family,\" and his maternal grandparents who share his love of baseball card collecting; but is treated with fear, pity, awkwardness, and teasing by those unaware of his humanity, humor, and intelligence. Rocky's mother, Florence \"Rusty\" Dennis, is determined to give Rocky as normal a life as possible, in spite of her own wild ways as a member of the Turks biker gang, as well as her strained relationship with her parents. She fights for Rocky's inclusion in a mainstream junior high school, and confronts a principal who would rather classify Rocky as mentally retarded and relegate him to a special education school, despite the fact that his condition has not affected his intelligence. Rocky thrives at school, making friends by assisting a fellow student with remembering his locker combination, and winning over a class by using humor when faced with an awkward silence during roll call, where Rocky just repeats the prior new student's line, \"Wow, thanks a lot.\" He shows his brilliance in history class by giving a rendition of the Greek myth about the Trojan Horse and it being the turning point of the Trojan War. Gradually overcoming discrimination and tutoring his classmates for $3 per hour, Rocky is asked by the principal to accept a job as a counselor's aide at Camp Bloomfield, a summer camp for blind children. At his graduation from junior high, Rocky takes home academic achievement prizes in mathematics, history, and science. Rocky feels the need to leave his chronically depressed and drug-addicted mother, and helps her break her drug habit. At camp, Rocky falls in love with Diana Adams, a blind girl who cannot see (but feels) his deformed skull and is entranced by Rocky's kindness and compassion. Rocky uses his intelligence to explain to Diana words like \"billowy,\" \"clouds,\" \"red,\" and \"green\" by using cotton balls as a touchable vision of \"billowy clouds,\" a warm rock to explain \"red\" and \"pink,\" and a frozen rock to explain \"icy blue.\" Diana introduces Rocky to her parents, who are put off by Rocky's appearance, and do not want Diana to spend time with him. Later, Rocky faces the pain of separation from the two people to which he feels closest. Diana goes away to a school for the blind, and his dream of a motorbike trip through Europe collapses when his best friend Ben, who was to come with him, tells him that he is moving back to Michigan for good. This drives Rocky into berating Ben and calling him \"stupid\", then finally revealing to Ben that he conned him out of a Rube Walker card. Rocky also finds it difficult to thrive at high school, where none of his friends are. However, Rocky feels better after taking a bus trip by himself to visit Diana at the equestrian stables, located near Griffith Park. Diana tells Rocky that her parents prevented her from receiving his phone messages. Despite this, Rocky vows that no matter how separated they're gonna be, they will always love each other, and will always be together. One evening when Rocky's biker family is visiting, Rocky is fighting a fierce headache and quietly withdraws to his room, removes the tacks from his map of Europe, and goes to bed. The next morning, Rusty tries to wake up Rocky for school and flies into a fit of grief-stricken rage when she realizes he has died. After destroying the kitchen, Rusty mourns the death of Rocky and says \"Now you can go anywhere you want, baby.\" She then re-pins his map of Europe. The film ends with Rocky's biker family, Rusty, Gar, and Dozer, visiting his grave, leaving flowers and some 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers baseball cards by his headstone, as Rocky's voice is heard reciting the poem he wrote earlier for English class."

She originally hoped the film would focus on Rocky's life and intrepid personality rather than giving equal emphasis to her story, but was won over by Cher's role, stating: \"Cher depicted the way I am very well. I always thought I was perfectly normal, that the rest of the world is nuts.\" In 1984 camp scenes for the movie were filmed at Camp Bloomfield. Campers and staff got a preview of the finished film at Universal Studios in February, 1985. Bogdanovich had originally intended to use several songs by Bruce Springsteen, the real Rocky Dennis' favorite singer. But due to an impasse between Universal Pictures and Springsteen's label, Columbia Records, the songs were pulled from the film and replaced with songs by Bob Seger for the original theatrical release. Bogdanovich sued Universal for $19 million, alleging the film studio switched the music without his approval in violation of his final cut privilege. The Springsteen songs were eventually restored for the 2004 director's cut DVD of the film."

The film was directed by the Greek Cypriot Michael Cacoyannis and written by Cacoyannis and Iakovos Kambanelis.  The music was composed by Manos Hadjidakis and Vassilis Tsitsanis. Stella was originally intended to be a stage play with the title Stella with the Red Gloves, but it was never staged. It has been claimed that this story was the perfect vehicle for the thirty-five-year-old Mercouri's film debut. Indeed, it was the hit that Melina Mercouri needed. The film sparked great controversy, and although it was initially rejected by Greek critics, it is now considered one of the five greatest Greek films. At the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, where the film was screened, Melina met Jules Dassin, her future husband, mentor, and director. He helped her to secure major roles in such films as Topkapi, Never on Sunday, Phaedra, and 10:30 P.M. Summer, which have become major international successes."

After the child is discovered at the workshop, the elves name him Buddy after his diaper's brand label and Papa Elf adopts him. Buddy is accepted by the elf community and grows up thinking he is an elf, but soon learns that he is really a human. Papa Elf explains that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, and that Susan put him up for adoption prior to her death. Walter now works as a children's book publisher at the Empire State Building in New York City, unaware of Buddy's existence. Santa reveals that Walter is on the Naughty List due to his selfishness, but suggests Buddy could help redeem Walter. Buddy travels to New York and finds Walter at work, but Walter mistakes him for a Christmas-gram messenger and has him ejected. Buddy heads to a local Gimbels department store and meets Jovie, an unenthusiastic employee with whom he is instantly smitten. Hearing that Santa will be at the store the following day, Buddy redecorates the store overnight. However, upon realizing that the Gimbels Santa is not the genuine article, Buddy unmasks him and causes a brawl in the store that the manager Wanda breaks up. Walter reluctantly bails Buddy out of the police station and takes him for a DNA test, confirming that Buddy is his biological son. Dr. Leonardo convinces Walter to take Buddy home to meet his stepmother Emily and half-brother Michael. Walter and Michael are unnerved by Buddy's strange behavior, but Emily insists that they care for him until he \"recovers\". Michael warms up to Buddy after they defeat a gang of bullies in a snowball fight and encourages Buddy to ask Jovie out on a date, which she accepts. During the date, the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Walter's publishing company is failing after their latest book flops. Walter's boss, Fulton Greenway, expects Walter to have a new book ready by Christmas Eve. Walter and his team secure a meeting with best-selling children's author Miles Finch, but Buddy interrupts the meeting and mistakes  Finch, who has dwarfism, for an elf. Buddy unintentionally insults Finch before the latter attacks him and leaves the meeting, upon which Walter loses his temper and disowns Buddy. Heartbroken, Buddy writes an apology note on an Etch A Sketch and leaves Walter's apartment. Upon finding Finch's notebook full of ideas, Walter and his team scramble to create a book to pitch. As Walter prepares to pitch the book to Greenway, Michael arrives and informs Walter of Buddy's departure. Realizing his mistake, Walter quits his job and walks out with Michael to find Buddy. Meanwhile, Buddy sees Santa's sleigh crash in Central Park, attracting a large crowd. Santa explains that the sleigh's engine is lost and cannot fly without it due to a shortage of Christmas spirit. Buddy finds the engine and reunites with Walter and Michael. Walter apologizes to Buddy for how he treated him and accepts him as his son. After he takes them to meet Santa, Michael takes Santa's list and reads it in front of television news cameras gathered outside the park, proving that Santa is real. A group of Central Park Rangers, who are angry at Santa for placing them on the Naughty List, chase the sleigh as Buddy tries to reattach the engine. Jovie leads the crowd and those watching on television in singing \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\", raising enough Christmas spirit to fully power the sleigh without the engine. By the following Christmas, Buddy writes a book about his life, which becomes a bestseller and allows Walter to establish his own publishing company. Buddy also marries Jovie and brings their newborn daughter Susie to visit Papa Elf."

He warns that his employer at Biocyte Pharmaceuticals forced him to develop a biological weapon to profit from the cure. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the Chimera virus, and its remedy, Bellerophon. With Ethan on holiday, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon, destroying the aircraft to cover their escape. IMF director Swanbeck informs Ethan of the circumstances of Nekhorvich's death, and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain -- and Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. Ethan successfully recruits her to trace Ambrose and his team, and to spy on Ambrose, despite her reluctance. Ethan assembles his team, computer hacker Luther Stickell and Pilot Billy Baird, in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located, and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan's team. Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy, and shows him a video of Chimera infecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket. Ethan's team kidnaps McCloy to sting him for information. They discover that the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for the Chimera. Ethan's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan can destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose commands Nyah to collect the specimen; however, she injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from eliminating her after the retrieval. Nyah begs Ethan to kill her along with the virus, but Ethan refuses. Ambrose abducts Nyah as Ethan flees the facility. Ambrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He plans to get rich from Biocyte's stock due to demand for Bellerophon after Chimera is released. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose's men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliffside, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men, but the last man, Hugh Stamp (Ambrose's best friend) is accidentally shot by Ambrose himself. Ambrose chases Ethan to a beach, where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a pistol from the sand he uses to finally kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to save her. Director Swanbeck realizes that Ethan destroyed the virus but the IMF clears Nyah's criminal record, and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney."

One brother, Primo, is a brilliant, perfectionist chef who chafes under their few customers' expectations of \"Americanized\" Italian food. Their uncle's offer for them to return to Rome to help with his restaurant is growing in appeal to Primo. The younger brother, Secondo, is the restaurant manager, a man enamoured of the possibilities presented by their new endeavor and life in America. Despite Secondo's efforts and Primo's magnificent food, their restaurant is failing to gain success and recognition. Secondo's struggles as a businessman render him unable to commit to his girlfriend Phyllis, and he has recently been sleeping with Gabriella, the wife of a competitor. Her husband's eponymous restaurant, \"Pascal's\", has succeeded despite (or perhaps due to) the mediocre, uninspired food served there. Desperate to keep Paradise afloat, Secondo asks Pascal for a loan. Pascal demurs, repeating a past offer for the brothers to work for him, which Secondo refuses: he and his brother want their own restaurant.  In a seemingly generous gesture, Pascal insists that he will persuade popular Italian-American singer Louis Prima to dine at Paradise when in town, assuming the celebrity jazz singer's patronage will revitalize the brothers' business. Primo and Secondo dive into the preparations for this \"big night\", spending their entire savings on  food, drinks and decoration, inviting numerous people (including a newspaper reporter and Primo's love interest) to join them for a magnificent feast showcasing a timballo (a complex baked pasta dish). Primo pours his heart into every dish, lavishing care and great expertise on the cooking. As they wait for Prima and his entourage to arrive, the dinner party indulges in the exquisite food and partake in a fabulous celebration. Hours go by, however, and it becomes apparent that the famous singer is not coming, although a reporter who came to cover the singer's appearance promises to ask his newspaper to send a food critic. Phyllis catches Secondo and Gabriella kissing and runs off to the beach. At Gabriella's insistence, Pascal admits that he never called Louis Prima, thus ending the party. Secondo follows Phyllis to the beach where they have a final quarrel.  Primo and Secondo have a fiery, heart-wrenching argument, chafing at their mutual differences. In the wee hours of the morning, Pascal admits to Secondo that he set the brothers up for failure; not as revenge for Secondo's affair with Gabriella but because the brothers would have no choice but to return to Italy or work for Pascal.  Secondo refuses him, saying they will never work for him. As dawn breaks, Secondo silently cooks scrambled eggs. When done, he divides it among three plates, giving one to Cristiano, their waiter, and eating one himself. Primo hesitantly enters, and Secondo hands him the last plate. They eat without speaking, and lay their arms across one another's shoulders."

The USOC is skeptical, but ultimately gives Brooks the job. Brooks meets his assistant coach Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich) at the tryouts in Colorado Springs. Brooks selects a preliminary roster of 26, indifferent to the preferences of senior USOC hockey officials, after only a day. Needing to cut the roster to 20 before the Olympics, he convinces USOC executive director Walter Bush (Sean McCann) that he has their best interests at heart. Bush reluctantly agrees to take the heat from the committee for Brooks' decisions. During the initial practice, tempers flare as forward Rob McClanahan (Nathan West) and defenseman Jack O'Callahan (Michael Mantenuto) get into a fight based on college rivalry. Brooks allows the fight to go on so they can get the bad blood out of their systems and then he bluntly tells all the players that they are to let go of old rivalries and start becoming a team. He then calls for introductions and the players each tell their name, hometown and which team they play for. As practices continue, Brooks uses unorthodox methods to reduce the roster down to 20 players. The players themselves worry about being cut at any time, knowing that Brooks himself was the last player cut from the 1960 Olympic hockey team that won the gold medal, so he will do anything to win. During an exhibition game against Norway in Oslo that ends in a 3\u20133 tie, Brooks notices the players are distracted and not playing up to their potential. After the game, he orders them back on the ice for a bag skate. Brooks has them skate from one end of the ice to the other several times (doing, in other words, his infamous \"Herbies,\" as the team would call them colloquially), continuing the drill even after the rink manager cuts the power. Exhausted, forward and team captain Mike Eruzione (Patrick O'Brien Demsey) re-introduces himself in the same manner from the initial practice and cries out that he plays for the United States. Getting the answer he wanted all along, Brooks finally tells the players they are done. Eventually, the team comes together, with the players thinking of themselves as a family representing the United States. With their roster finalized, just before heading to Lake Placid, the Americans play the Soviets in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden. The Soviets manhandle the young American team, winning by a score of 10\u20133. During the game, O'Callahan suffers a knee injury that could keep him out of the entire Olympics, and starting goaltender Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill) is shockingly told he may be benched in favor of backup Steve Janaszak (Sam Skoryna). Brooks tells him that he hasn't been giving his very best and ultimately decides to keep Craig as the starter for the Olympics. As the 1980 Winter Olympics begins, the Americans trail Sweden 2\u20131 in the first game. Brooks fires up the team during an intermission by throwing a table and accuses McClanahan, who suffered a relatively minor leg injury, of quitting. McClanahan ends up playing despite his injury, which inspires the team. Bill Baker (Nick Postle) scores a goal with only 27 seconds remaining in the third period for a dramatic 2\u20132 tie. They then follow up with a 7\u20133 win over heavily favored Czechoslovakia. As the Olympics continue, the team defeats Norway, Romania, and West Germany to earn a spot in the medal round. The Americans are considered overwhelming underdogs to the Soviets in the first medal round game. The game begins and the Soviets score the first goal. Then O'Callahan, having healed enough from his injury, enters the game for the first time. He makes an immediate impact by heavily checking Vladimir Krutov on a play that leads to a goal by Buzz Schneider (Billy Schneider). The Soviets score again to retake the lead. In the final seconds, Soviet goalie Vladislav Tretiak stops a long shot by Dave Christian (Stephen Kovalcik), but Mark Johnson (Eric Peter-Kaiser) gets the rebound and scores with less than one second left in the period. During the first intermission, Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov (Zinaid Memi\u0161evi\u0107) replaces Tretiak with backup Vladimir Myshkin. In the second period, the Soviets score a goal to go up 3\u20132. Early in the final period, the Soviet team is called for a penalty for slashing, putting the Americans on the power play. Johnson scores his second goal of the game just as the penalty is about to expire. Later, Eruzione puts them ahead 4\u20133 with 10 minutes left. The Americans hold off the Soviets to win the game, completing one of the biggest upsets in sports history. Two days later, the team would go on to defeat Finland 4\u20132 to win the gold medal. The movie ends with Brooks staring out over his team with pride as the entire team crowds together on the gold medal platform. Before the credits, the film is dedicated to Herb Brooks who died right before principal photography was finished and states \"He never saw it. He lived it.\""

        "content": "Gavin O'Connor directed and Mark Ciardi produced the movie. Both are drawn to inspirational stories and they decided to take on the \"Greatest Sports Moment of the 20th Century\". They chose to focus on the determination and focus of coach Herb Brooks. O'Connor knew from the beginning that he wanted to cast Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks because he needed someone with an athletic background and a fiery passion for sports. The casting of the team consisted of real hockey players to give the film a raw and accurate feel. O'Connor figured it would be easier to teach hockey players to act than to teach actors to play hockey. On-ice tryouts were held in New York, Boston, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Vancouver. Another tryout was held in Vancouver for the Soviet and European teams. There are a total of 133 different hockey plays in the film. To accomplish this, the directors turned to ReelSports Solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, The Rookie. The ReelSports team referred to coach Herb Brooks for information on practices, plays, equipment, and uniform styles. Each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors' safety. Players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment. All of the locations of the real life hockey games are replicated by hockey arenas in British Columbia. The team tryouts, set in Colorado Springs, were filmed at the Queen's Park Arena in New Westminster. The team practices were filmed at the M.S.A. Arena in Abbotsford. The exhibition game in which the USA team lost to the USSR team at Madison Square Garden was filmed at the Pacific Coliseum, former home of the Vancouver Canucks. The Exhibition against Norway, the subsequent bag skate, and all Olympic game scenes were filmed at the PNE Agrodome. Al Michaels re-recorded most of his television commentary for the film. However, the last 30 seconds of the USA-Soviet game, including \"Do you believe in miracles?\" used the original audio, as Michaels didn't feel he could re-create the call effectively. Sadly, Coach Brooks died in a car accident before the movie was released. At the end, before the credits it states, \"This film is dedicated to the memory of Herb Brooks, who died shortly following principal photography. He never saw it. He lived it.\""

There, Miranda, a mermaid, catches him by pulling on his fishing line and making him fall in the water. She drags him down to her underwater cavern where she keeps him prisoner for a week and only lets him go after he agrees to show her London, where he lives. Having ordered several extra long dresses from his wife's London couturier to cover her tail, he disguises her as an invalid patient in a bath chair and takes her to his home, initially for a three weeks stay. Martin's wife Clare reluctantly agrees to the arrangement, but insists he hire someone to look after the \"patient\". He selects Nurse Carey for her eccentric nature and takes her into his confidence. To Paul's relief, Carey is delighted to be working for a mermaid as she has always believed they exist. Miranda's seductive nature earns her the admiration of not only Paul, but also his chauffeur Charles, as well as Nigel, the fianc\u00e9 of Clare's friend and neighbour Isobel, arousing the jealousy of the women. Nigel even breaks off his engagement, but when he and Charles discover that Miranda has been flirting with both of them, they come to their senses. With Clare strongly suspecting that Miranda is a mermaid, she makes Martin admit it. But when Miranda overhears Clare telling Paul that the public must be told, Miranda wheels herself down to the Thames and makes her escape into the water. She had previously told them she would go to Majorca for a visit. In the final scene, Miranda is shown on a rock, holding a merbaby on her lap."

One day, Simon comes home from the grocery store to find an unconscious woman in Chance's bed. The film then goes back several months. Chance is annoyed when Rory, a struggling soap opera actor with whom Chance had a one-night stand, appears at her door and becomes emotional trying to convince her that they have a connection beyond just sex. Chance and Simon spin a story about meeting in a mental institution, which makes Rory uncomfortable enough to stop crying and to leave. Simon tricks Chance into answering a phone call from her mother by telling her that it is a man named Jack whom she was immediately attracted to when she met him at a nightclub. Her mother, Desiree, is calling to tell her that she is coming to visit. Trying to escape spending time with her mother, Chance persuades Simon to switch roles with her for the weekend and Simon spends time with Desiree pretending to be Chance until Desiree tells Simon that she needs to talk to Chance about something in particular. Desiree tells Chance that she is leaving Chance's father Malcolm, who is in a relationship with another woman named Heidi. Upset, Chance tells Simon about her parents' divorce and reveals that Desiree wants to stay with them for a while. Chance is suspicious when Simon tries to offer some comfort, and he begs again for $200 to pay off some unpaid parking tickets. Though hesitant to loan anyone money because of a bad experience with her first serious boyfriend, Chance agrees to give him the money for playing along with her charade for her mother. Uncomfortable with the idea of her mother living with her, Chance arranges for Desiree and her to have dinner with Malcolm and Heidi. Chance also invites Rory and, as Chance had hoped, Heidi is immediately smitten with him because she watches the soap opera in which he stars. When Rory manages to get Heidi out of the room, Chance asks her parents about the divorce. Malcolm reveals that Desiree had suggested that they experiment sexually with Heidi, and Desiree felt rejected when Heidi preferred him. Desiree insists that he seduced her, but Malcolm denies it. Malcolm says that while attractions may come and go he loves her. Chance goes out to a nightclub one night and meets a woman named Sara, who makes sexual advances on her. Chance brings Sara home with her, and after spending a day in bed together, Sara suggests that they take some drugs. Chance refuses and takes the drugs away. Chance leaves her apartment the next morning, and when she returns she finds Simon in her bedroom with Sara, who has apparently overdosed; Chance fears that Sara may have died from the drugs. Simon, overcome with emotion, kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, the two quickly begin to fight about the significance of the sex and Simon leaves the apartment. The next morning Chance awakes to find Sara, alive, sitting at the kitchen table. She thanks Chance for a place to sleep off the drugs and then leaves. Meanwhile, Simon runs into Jack, who recognizes him from the nightclub. When Simon realizes that Jack is hitting on him, he tells him that Chance has a crush on him and thinks that he is straight. Simon then tells Jack about what had happened the night before and about his frustration and attraction to Chance. Jack tells Simon that, even though he is gay, he sometimes has sex with women because he needs the contact with human beings, and Simon realizes that he needs that human contact too. Simon returns to Chance's apartment, and Chance is happy to see him, greeting him with a hug. They apologize for their actions and both admit that they are ready to try a relationship."

Gerry and Cookie Fleck are a middle-class couple from Florida who arrive at the Taft Hotel with their terrier Winky. After having forgotten to pay their credit card bill and short of cash, they are forced to sleep in the hotel's storage room. While traveling to the show, they encounter several of Cookie\u2019s former lovers who kiss her passionately and try to seduce her, making Gerry jealous. To Gerry's chagrin, they cross paths with Cookie's paramours after the show ends. Meg and Hamilton Swan, a stereotypical yuppie couple from a Chicago suburb, arrive with their Weimaraner Beatrice. Their constant doting and neurotic behavior confuses and upsets Beatrice. Earlier they take Beatrice to a psychotherapist after she sees them having sex in a position they learned from the Kama Sutra. The Swans lose Beatrice's favorite toy and frantically search for a replacement before the show starts, but are unable to find one. When Beatrice performs poorly and is removed by a judge for unruly behavior, they blame it on the lost toy. Later they replace Beatrice with another dog. Harlan Pepper, the Southern owner of a fishing goods store and an aspiring ventriloquist, arrives with his Bloodhound Hubert. Harlan is an affable, good-natured man who prides himself on being able to name every type of nut. The Pepper family has raised a variety of hounds for generations; Harlan continues the tradition by raising Bloodhounds. Sherri Ann Cabot is the plump, buxom, overly-made-up trophy wife of the elderly Leslie Ward Cabot, her sugar daddy. A former two-time winner of the show, Sherri Ann receives help with her Standard Poodle Rhapsody in White, also known as Butch, from her taskmaster trainer Christy Cummings.  Christy is an extremely competitive handler who makes sure the dog is prepared for the show. A no-nonsense, short-haired lesbian, she resists Sherri Ann's attempts at giving her a beauty makeover. Leslie is oblivious to Christy and Sherri Ann's romantic involvement \u2014 as well as everything else happening around him. Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof are a campy gay couple who take great pride in their Shih Tzu Miss Agnes. They are confident that she will win the competition. They share a love of old movies and enjoy making fun of Christy Cummings, but are friendly to the other competitors, especially the Flecks. The dog show is hosted by dog expert Trevor Beckwith and oblivious \"color\" commentator Buck Laughlin, whose inane banter annoys Beckwith. During the first round, Beatrice is disqualified when she becomes aggressive and Hamilton cannot control her. The other four dogs advance to the final round. Just before the finals, Cookie dislocates her knee and insists that Gerry take over for her despite his two left feet (the result of a birth defect). Though Gerry is nervous, Winky ultimately takes Best in Show. After the competition, Gerry and Cookie return home to Florida and enjoy brief fame there. While in a studio recording novelty songs about terriers, they discover that the recording engineer is yet another of Cookie's ex-lovers, to Gerry's unending frustration. Christy and Sherri Ann publish American Bitch, a magazine for lesbian owners of purebred dogs. After spending weeks on a kibbutz, Harlan fulfills his dream of being a ventriloquist, entertaining sparse crowds with a honky tonk song-and-dance number. Stefan and Scott design a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs in costume appearing in scenes from classic films such as Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. Meg and Hamilton Swan replace Beatrice with a pug named Kipper, which they claim enjoys watching them make love."

Jack is in Turkey shooting a movie, and makes arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment. Jack asks his roommates to keep the delivery a secret per his friend's wishes; when Mary arrives, they believe she is the \u201cpackage.\u201d Peter and Michael are totally befuddled how to care for Mary, and Peter leaves to buy supplies. Their landlady Mrs. Hathaway delivers a small box \u2013 the actual \"package\" of heroin \u2013 which Michael tosses aside. They learn to care for Mary, including diaper changes, baths, and feedings. Four days later, two drug dealers arrive at the apartment for the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give them Mary, along with a can of powdered milk the dealers believe is the heroin. Peter discovers the actual package; realizing the mix-up, he runs downstairs but trips, spilling the package's contents. He gathers up the drugs and confronts the men outside, causing a scuffle. A police officer on horseback intervenes; Peter rescues Mary, but the dealers flee with the can of powdered milk. The officer detains Peter and Michael at the apartment until Sgt. Melkowitz, a narcotics officer, arrives to question them. Jack calls from Turkey, but Peter and Michael are unable to talk openly as they are being recorded.

The film tells the story of the rock band the Doors, emphasizing the life of its lead singer, Jim Morrison. The film portrays Morrison as a larger-than-life icon of 1960s rock and roll and counterculture, including portrayals of Morrison's recreational drug use, free love, hippie lifestyle, alcoholism, interest in hallucinogenic drugs as entheogens, and, particularly, his growing obsession with death, presented as threads which weave in and out of the film. Released by Tri-Star Pictures on March 1, 1991, The Doors grossed $34 million worldwide against its $32 million production budget and received mixed reviews from critics, audience and fans of the band alike. Kilmer's performance as Morrison was widely praised as well as the supporting cast, the cinematography, the production design and Stone's directing.

In 1965, Jim arrives in California and is assimilated into the Venice Beach culture. During his tenure studying at UCLA, he meets his future girlfriend, Pamela Courson. He also meets Ray Manzarek for the first time, as well as Robby Krieger and John Densmore, all of whom form \"The Doors\" with Morrison. Jim convinces his bandmates to travel to Death Valley and experience the effects of psychedelic drugs. Returning to Los Angeles, they play several shows at the famous Whisky a Go Go nightclub and develop a rabid fanbase. Jim's onstage antics and lewd performance of the group's song \"The End\" upset the club's owners, and the band is ejected from the venue. After the show, they are approached by producer Paul A. Rothchild and Jac Holzman of Elektra Records and are offered a deal to record their first album. The Doors are soon invited to perform on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to be told by one of the producers that they must change the lyric \"girl we couldn't get much higher\" in the song \"Light My Fire\", due to a possible reference to drugs. Despite this, Morrison performs the original lyric during the live broadcast and the band is not allowed to perform on the show again. As the Doors' success continues, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as \"The Lizard King\" and develops an addiction to alcohol and drugs. Jim meets Patricia Kennealy, a rock journalist involved in witchcraft, and participates in mystical ceremonies with her, including a handfasting ceremony. Meanwhile, an elder spirit watches these events. The rest of the band grows weary of Jim's missed recording sessions and absences at concerts. Jim arrives late to a Miami, Florida concert, becoming increasingly confrontational towards the audience and allegedly exposing himself onstage. The incident is a low point for the band, resulting in criminal charges against Jim, cancellations of shows, breakdowns in Jim's personal relationships, and resentment from the other band members. In 1970, following a lengthy trial, Jim is found guilty of indecent exposure and ordered to serve time in prison. However, he is allowed to remain free on bail, pending the results of an appeal. Patricia tells Jim that she is pregnant with his child, but Jim convinces her to have an abortion. Jim visits his bandmates for the final time, attending a birthday party hosted by Ray where he wishes the band luck in their future endeavors and gives each of them a copy of his poetry book An American Prayer. As Jim plays in the front garden with the children, he sees that one of them is his childhood self and comments, \"This is the strangest life I've ever known\" (a lyric from the Doors song \"Waiting for the Sun\"). In 1971, Jim and Pam move to Paris, France to escape the pressures of the L.A. lifestyle. One evening, Pam finds Jim dead in the bathtub of their apartment. The film's final scenes before the credits roll are of Jim's gravesite in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, while \"The Severed Garden (Adagio)\" (from An American Prayer) plays in the background. Just before the closing credits, the screen whites out and text appears stating that \"Jim Morrison is said to have died of heart failure. He was 27. Pam joined him three years later.\" During the closing credits, the band is shown recording the song \"L.A. Woman\" in the studio."

        "content": "Film directors Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin had all flirted with making a Doors biopic over the years. In 1985, Columbia Pictures acquired the rights from the Doors and the Morrison estate to make a film. Producer Sasha Harari wanted filmmaker Oliver Stone to write the screenplay but never heard back from his agent. After two unsatisfactory scripts were produced, Imagine Films replaced Columbia. Harari contacted Stone again and the director met with the surviving band members, telling them he wanted to keep a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended by this and exercised their right of approval over the director, rejecting Stone. By 1989, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who owned Carolco Pictures, had acquired the rights to the project and wanted Stone to direct it. The Doors had seen Stone's film Platoon (1986) and were impressed with what he had done, and Stone agreed to make the film after his next project, Evita. After spending years working on Evita and courting both Madonna and Meryl Streep to play the titular role, the film fell apart over salary negotiations with Streep and Stone quickly moved into pre-production for The Doors. Guitarist Robby Krieger had always opposed a Doors biopic until Stone signed on to direct. Conversely, keyboardist Ray Manzarek had traditionally been the biggest advocate of immortalizing the band on film but opposed Stone's involvement. He was not happy with the direction that Stone was going to take with the film and refused to give his approval. According to actor Kyle MacLachlan, \"I know that he and Oliver weren't speaking. I think it was hard for Ray, he being the keeper of the Doors myth for so long\". According to Krieger, \"when the Doors broke up Ray had his idea of how the band should be portrayed and John and I had ours\". Manzarek stated that he was not asked to consult on the film and wanted it to be about all four band members equally, rather than the focus being on Morrison. Conversely, Stone stated that he repeatedly tried to get Manzarek involved, but \"all he did was rave and shout. He went on for three hours about his point of view... I didn't want Ray to be dominant, but Ray thought he knew better than anybody else\"."

        "content": "\"The Naked Now\" is the third episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, originally aired on October 5, 1987, in broadcast syndication in the United States. Directed by Paul Lynch, the episode had been written by D.C. Fontana, under the pseudonym of \"J. Michael Bingham,\" with John D.F. Black also credited for his role in devising the plot's origins. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the  Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise encounters a research ship where all personnel are found dead. The Enterprise crew quickly become infected with the same affliction, one that is similar to that suffered by the crew of James T. Kirk's USS Enterprise decades before. Based on an unfinished teleplay by Gene Roddenberry, the episode deliberately followed up on the events of original series Star Trek first season episode \"The Naked Time\" (1966). Fans initially criticised the origins of the episode, and later reviews were also largely negative."

        "content": "The crew of the  Enterprise responds to messages received from the SS Tsiolkovsky, a science vessel monitoring the collapse of a supergiant star. The messages suggest, amid their rounds of laughter, that the crew has been exposed to a sudden hull breach. After the Enterprise secures the Tsiolkovsky via tractor beam, an away team beams over and finds the crew frozen to death in various stages of undress\u2014including one who was taking a shower fully clad. A woman's body, frozen, falls into Lt. La Forge's (LeVar Burton) hands. Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) orders full medical examinations of the away team on their return, and finds La Forge sweating profusely and complaining about the temperature. She orders him to stay in sickbay but he wanders out while she is studying his test results, and makes his way to the quarters of Crusher's son, Wesley (Wil Wheaton). Unaware of La Forge's condition, Wesley shows him a portable tractor beam device and La Forge places an encouraging hand on his shoulder. Meanwhile, acting on a hunch by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who had read up on past starships named \"Enterprise\" that included an event involving illness and showering fully dressed, Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) locates a historical record identifying the ailment as similar to one encountered by Captain Kirk's USS Enterprise. La Forge returns to sickbay, where Dr. Crusher quickly becomes concerned when she realizes that the infection is spread by physical contact. Much of the ship's crew comes under the influence of the ailment, with much sexier results than on Kirk's Enterprise. Most notably, a \"fully functional\" Data engages in a sexual encounter with Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby). Dr. Crusher, struggling against the effects of the ailment, finds the original antidote documented by Kirk's Enterprise to be ineffective, and begins devising a new version of it. Now infected, Wesley uses a digital sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key engineering crew-members away from the engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports that he will not have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship to move out of the way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster."

        "content": "Star Trek: The Next Generation's creator, Gene Roddenberry, wanted to include an episode revealing the characters' motivations to the audience early on in the series. As a basis, he turned to the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"The Naked Time.\" Executive producer Rick Berman described \"The Naked Now\" as \"a[n] homage, not a copy\" of \"The Naked Time,\" while director Paul Lynch described it as \"slightly more adult and a lot more comic than the original\". \"The Naked Now\" is based on an incomplete teleplay by Roddenberry for The Next Generation, titled \"Revelations.\" The first few scenes remained largely similar, but in \"Revelations\" La Forge infected Yar while making unsuccessful sexual advances toward her. Original Series writer D.C. Fontana wrote a new draft of the teleplay with several further changes that failed to make it into the final installment. These included Data turning down Yar's sexual advances, Troi's lack of privacy due to empathic abilities, Picard's concern for the families on the ship, and Riker's fear of becoming a lonely starship captain. Brooke Bundy made her only appearance as the first Chief Engineer of the Enterprise, Sarah MacDougal, in this episode. The post of Chief Engineer changed hands numerous times through the rest of season one before Geordi La Forge was finally assigned the post on a permanent basis in season two. Michael Rider made his first appearance as an unnamed transporter chief but his scene was cut in this episode. He would go on to appear in the same role twice more before appearing a final time as the same security guard. The SS Tsiolkovsky model was a re-dress of the USS Grissom from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984). Michael Okuda created a ship's dedication plaque for the Tsiolkovsky which stated that it had been created in the Soviet Union. A copy was subsequently sent for display at the Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics in Kaluga, Soviet Russia."

The race abide by a strict code of honor and their leader seeks to use Yar as a pawn to increase his power. Powers and Baron pitched a story based on a reptilian race following a code of honor similar to the bushido code of the Samurai.

The crew, possessing little information on the Ligonian culture, finds it follows strict customs of status similar to ancient China. Specifically, while the men in their culture rule society, the land itself is controlled by the women. Lutan (Jessie Lawrence Ferguson), the Ligonian leader, transports up to the Enterprise to provide a sample of the vaccine, and is impressed by Lt. Tasha Yar's status as head of security. Yar further demonstrates her aikido skills against a holographic opponent for Lutan on the holodeck.  After a tour of the ship, Lutan and the Ligonians abduct Yar as they transport back to the surface. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) demands that Lutan return Yar, considering the kidnapping an act of war, but receives no response from the planet. After consultation with his officers, Picard determines that Lutan took Yar in a \"counting coup\" as a show of heroism. Picard contacts Lutan in a more peaceful manner, who grants permission for the Enterprise crew to beam down to the planet and promises to return Yar after a banquet in his honor. Lutan announces at the banquet that he wishes to make Yar his \"First one\", surprising not only the Enterprise crew but also Yareena (Karole Selmon) who was already Lutan's \"First one.\" Yareena challenges Yar to a fight to the death to claim back the position. When Picard objects to the fight, Lutan refuses to give the Enterprise the rest of the vaccine unless Yar participates.  The crew investigates the combat ritual and find that the weapons used are coated with a lethal poison, and also that it is Yareena's wealth to which Lutan owes his position. Picard prepares to have Yar beamed to the Enterprise should she be harmed in the battle. As the match progresses, both Yareena and Yar are equally skilled, but Yar eventually lands a strike on Yareena. Yar quickly covers Yareena and orders the transport of both of them to the Enterprise against the demands of Lutan. Aboard the ship, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) reaches Yareena moments after death, but is able to counteract the poison and revive the woman's body. When Lutan demands to know the fate of Yareena, Crusher reveals that Yareena died, thus ceding the match to Yar and breaking the \"first one\" bond.  Yareena is now free to select a new mate; she chooses Hagon (James Louis Watkins), one of Lutan's bodyguards, and effectively strips Lutan of his position of power and makes him her \"Second One\". Hagon lets Yar go and gives the Enterprise their full supply of vaccine."

        "content": "Writer Katharyn Powers was invited to pitch a story for The Next Generation as she was friends with Star Trek writer D. C. Fontana. Alongside her writing partner Michael Baron, Powers pitched a story involving a reptilian race called the \"Tellisians\" who followed a code of honor similar to that of the samurai. However, the script and the aliens went through several changes before making it to the screen. Powers would go on to write the Season 1 episode \"Emancipation\" for Stargate SG-1, which held similar themes to \"Code of Honor\". The African theme of the episode was brought in by director Russ Mayberry, who had the Ligonians race cast entirely from African-American actors. Mayberry was fired during production by the show's creator Gene Roddenberry, and First Assistant Director Les Landau completed the episode. Star Trek novel author Keith DeCandido later recalled that this was because of the casting itself, while cast member Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher) thought that it was because Mayberry was racist towards the guest stars after they were cast. Staff writer Tracy Torm\u00e9 was not pleased with the \"1940s tribal Africa\" theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene towards the end of the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in The Original Series episode \"Amok Time\". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was \"a good idea, but the execution just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea.\" Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. Michael Dorn wished they hadn't done the episode, and was glad he was not in it. In 2012 interview, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode \"The Measure of a Man\" to be \"the first truly great episode of the series\", stating that the first season \"had several quite weak episodes\"; referring to \"Code of Honor\" in particular he said, \"I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about.\" The episode also saw the first appearance of the black and yellow grid structure of the empty holodeck. However, the interface unit used by Yar, which resembled a corded phone, was not seen again, with crew members using vocal commands to program the holodeck in future episodes. Captain Picard showed pride in his French heritage in this episode. This character quirk was rarely repeated, such as in the following episode \"The Last Outpost\", and by singing \"Fr\u00e8re Jacques\" in \"Disaster\" while escaping a turboshaft with three children."

        "content": "Child psychologist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is hired to conduct an experimental virtual reality treatment for coma patients: a \"Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System\" device managed by doctors Henry West and Miriam Kent (Dylan Baker and Marianne Jean-Baptiste) that allows her to enter a comatose mind and attempt to coax them into consciousness. The technology is funded by the parents of her patient, Edward Baines (Colton James), a young boy left comatose by a viral infection that causes an unusual form of schizophrenia. Despite Deane's lack of progress, West and Kent reject Deane's suggestion to reverse the feed to bring Baines into her mind, fearing the consequences of him experiencing an unfamiliar world. Serial killer Carl Rudolph Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) traps his victims in a cell in the form of a glass enclosure that slowly fills with water by means of an automatic timer, then uses a hoist in his basement to suspend himself above their bodies while watching the recorded video of their deaths. He succumbs to the same schizophrenic illness and falls into a coma just as the FBI identifies him, leaving them without any leads as to the location of his latest victim, Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff). After learning of this experimental technology, Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) persuades Deane to enter Stargher's mind and discover Hickson's location. Deane enters the dark dreamscape of Stargher's twisted psyche, filled with doll-like versions of his victims. Stargher's innocent side manifests as Young Stargher (Jake Thomas) and leads Deane through his memories of abuse he suffered at the hands of his sadistic father (Gareth Williams). Deane nurtures Young Stargher in hopes of getting Hickson's location but she is thwarted by another manifestation: King Stargher, a demonic idealization of his murderous side that dominates the dreamscape. King Stargher torments Deane until she forgets the world is not real. Dr. West discovers this while monitoring Deane's vitals. He warns that what happens to Deane while she is integrated into Stargher's mindscape will inflict neurological damage on her real body. Novak volunteers to enter Stargher's mind to make Deane remember herself. Inside Stargher's mind, Novak is captured and subjected to King Stargher's torture while Deane looks on as Stargher's servant. Novak reminds Deane of a painful memory to reawaken her awareness that she is in Stargher's mind. Deane breaks free of Stargher's hold and stabs King Stargher to free Novak. During their escape, Novak sees a version of the glass enclosure with the same insignia as the hoist in Stargher's basement. Novak's team discovers that after the hoist's previous owner went bankrupt, the government hired Stargher to seal up his property. Novak races to the property and finds Hickson treading water in the enclosure and breathing through a pipe. Novak breaks the glass wall and rescues Hickson. Deane, now sympathetic to Young Stargher, locks her colleagues out and reverses the feed of the device to pull Stargher's mind into her own. She presents a comforting paradise to Young Stargher but he knows it is only a temporary reprieve from King Stargher. He shifts to Adult Stargher to relate a childhood story of when he drowned an injured bird as a mercy killing to prevent its torture at his father's hands. King Stargher intrudes as a scaly snake-man but this time, Deane is in control and she beats him to a bloody pulp before impaling him with a sword. However, Young Stargher exhibits the same injuries as King Stargher, and killing either manifestation kills Stargher. Adult Stargher reminds her of the story of the bird and implores her to \"save\" him. Deane carries Young Stargher into a pool, putting him out of his misery as Stargher dies in the real world. In the aftermath, Deane and Novak meet outside of Stargher's house. The FBI has officially excluded the mind technology from their inquiry and Deane has gotten approval to use the reverse feed on Edward Baines. The final scene is of Baines walking to embrace Deane inside the paradise of Deane's mindscape."

Her father, Harry Sultenfuss, operates the town's funeral parlor, which also serves as their home. Vada's upbringing leads her to suffer from hypochondria and develop an obsession with death, and her father fails to understand it. Also living with them is \"Gramoo\", Vada's paternal grandmother, whose recent mind wandering accentuates Vada's worries. Her uncle Phil lives nearby and frequently helps the family. Vada hangs out with Thomas J. Sennett, an unpopular boy her age who is allergic to \"everything\". Other girls tease the two, thinking they are more than just friends. Thomas J. often accompanies Vada when she visits the doctor, who assures her that she is not sick. He is quite nice to her, although she is often unkind in return. Vada's summer begins well. She befriends Shelly DeVoto, the new makeup artist at the funeral parlor, who provides her with some much needed guidance. She also develops a crush on Mr. Bixler, her fifth-grade school teacher, and hears about an adult poetry writing class he is teaching. Wondering how to pay for the class, Vada schemes after seeing enough money in a cookie jar in Shelly's camper. During her first class, when advised to write about what is in her soul, Vada fears that she killed her mother, who died two days after giving birth to her. When Harry and Shelly start dating, Vada's attitude towards Shelly changes. One night, Vada follows Harry and Shelly to a bingo game and brings Thomas J. along to disrupt it. On the Fourth of July, when Shelly's ex-husband Danny shows up, Vada hopes that he will take Shelly back, but to no avail. Following the holiday, and another doctor visit, Vada and Thomas J. spot a beehive in the woods, which Thomas J. knocks down. Vada loses her mood ring in the process, and while the two look for it, the bees swarm and force them to run away. Shortly afterward, Harry invites Vada to a carnival, but she is unenthusiastic to go when he announces Shelly is also coming. Vada becomes distressed when the two announce their engagement there, leading her to contemplate running away. Later, Vada screams when she discovers she is hemorrhaging. With Harry not around, Shelly politely explains to Vada that she is experiencing her first period. As Vada accepts this happens only to girls, she is unwilling to see Thomas J., who happens to come by shortly afterward. A couple of days later, Vada and Thomas J. sit under a willow tree, wondering what a first kiss feels like, and they share one. After Vada heads home, Thomas J. returns to the woods to search for Vada's mood ring. Unaware that the beehive he knocked down is still active, he is surrounded and attacked by the bees, which ends up taking his life. Harry is left to deliver the tragic news to Vada. Following one more doctor visit, a devastated Vada stays in her bedroom for a full day. Prior to Thomas J.'s funeral, Shelly suggests that Harry cheer up Vada, but he brushes her off. To this, Shelly emotionally urges him to open his eyes to his daughter's pain. When Vada finally leaves her bedroom and sees Thomas J., her grief becomes so strong that she runs away. In tears, she rushes to Mr. Bixler's house, wanting to stay with him but discovering he is engaged. Vada continues her grieving on the willow tree, where she and Thomas J. hung out. When Vada returns home, everyone is relieved, including Shelly, whom Vada begins to accept as her future stepmother. Her grief also manages to mend the rift between her and her father, who assures Vada that her mother's death was not her fault. Toward the end of summer, Vada and her father see and comfort Mrs. Sennett, who still struggles with her son's death. She returns Vada's mood ring, which Thomas J. had found. On the last day of her writing class, Vada reads a poem in memory of her best friend."

An angry poltergeist residing in the family home terrorizes Sethe and her three children, an act which causes two of them to run away forever. Eight years later, Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) lives alone with her daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise). Paul D. (Danny Glover), an old friend from Sweet Home, the plantation Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds Sethe's home, where he drives off the angry spirit that inhabits it. Afterwards, Paul D. proposes that he should stay and Sethe responds favorably. Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean young woman who appears to have a cognitive delay (Thandie Newton) named Beloved finds her way into Sethe's yard and is taken in by her. Denver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe's reincarnated daughter. Nonetheless, she chooses not to divulge Beloved's origins to Sethe. One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D. dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell and rapes him. Paul D. resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead asks her to have a baby with him. When Stamp Paid (Albert Hall) a co-worker of Paul D who has known Sethe for many years, learns of Paul D's plans for a family with Sethe, he pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D. Years ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher (Jude Ciccolella), the owner of Sweet Home. She complained to Mrs. Garner (Angie Utt), Schoolteacher's sister-in-law, who confronted him. In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews brutally whipped Sethe, leaving a \"tree\" of keloid scars on her back. Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape. Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs (Beah Richards), Sethe's mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle (Hill Harper). Sethe was assaulted while searching for him in the barn. The Schoolteacher's nephews held her down, raped her, and forcibly took her breast milk. When Halle failed to appear, Sethe ran off alone. She crossed paths with Amy Denver (Kessia Embry), a white girl who treated Sethe's injuries and delivered Sethe's child, whom Sethe named Denver after Amy. Sethe eventually reached Baby Suggs' home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children. In desperation, Sethe slit her older daughter's throat, and attempted to kill her other children. Stamp Paid managed to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher departed. Sethe is detained for an unknown amount of time, and it is later revealed to Denver that she was saved from being hanged by an intervention from the Bodwins, a prominent Cincinnati family who knew Baby Suggs. Paul D., horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe. Sethe justifies her decision without apology, claiming that her children would be better off dead than enslaved. Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest. After Paul D.'s departure, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter. Feeling elated yet guilty, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver. Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate. The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work, having become physically and mentally drained by Beloved's parasitic nature. Denver becomes depressed yet, being inspired by a memory of her grandmother's confidence in her, she eventually musters the courage to leave the house and seek employment. After Denver finds employment with the Bodwins, women from the local church visit Sethe's house at the request of her new co-worker to perform an exorcism. Their motive for doing so is partly tempered with guilt; years before, they failed to warn Sethe of Schoolteacher's impending arrival. The women from the church comfort the family, and they are praying and singing loudly when Denver's new employer arrives to pick her up for work. Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher's arrival, tries to attack him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women. During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved's grip, becomes permanently bedridden. Some months later, Paul D. encounters Denver at the marketplace. He notices she has transformed into a confident and mature young woman. When Paul D. later arrives at Sethe's house, he finds her suffering from a deep malaise. He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her. Sethe tells him that she doesn't see the point, as Beloved, her \"best thing\", is gone. Paul D. disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing."

        "content": "\"Restless\" is the 22nd episode and season finale of season four of the supernatural drama television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997\u20132003), and the 78th episode of the series overall. The episode was written and directed by the show's creator Joss Whedon and originally aired on The WB in the United States on May 23, 2000. The premise of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is that an adolescent girl, Buffy Summers, is chosen by mystical forces and given superhuman powers to kill vampires, demons, and other evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. She is supported by a close circle of family and friends, nicknamed the Scooby Gang. \"Restless\" centers on the dreams of the four main characters after enduring an exhausting fight in the previous episode. The dreams are used to comment on the characters\u2014their fears, their past and their possible future. Consistent with each dream is the presence of the First Slayer who hunts and kills them one by one until, in the final sequence, she is confronted and disempowered by Buffy. The episode serves as a coda to the fourth season instead of a climax, as Whedon wanted to achieve something different for a season finale. Whedon experimented with several filming techniques to make the episode as dreamlike as possible. The episode also foreshadows upcoming events, most notably the first appearance of Buffy's sister Dawn. Buffy scholar Nikki Stafford calls the surrealistic episode \"unprecedented in television\", saying it is \"so jam-packed with information that we'll probably be seeing allusions to it for the rest of the series\", and referring to it as a \"mysterious lead-in to the emotionally turbulent season five\". \"Restless\" received high praise from critics upon airing, particularly for its character development, visual direction, and wit. It is frequently noted as one of the best episodes of the series."

        "content": "In the series, Buffy Summers is a teenager who, at the age of fifteen, was chosen by mystical forces to be the latest Slayer, a girl endowed with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces. After moving with her mother, Joyce (Kristine Sutherland), to the fictional town of Sunnydale, she befriends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), who join her in the struggle against evil. They are guided by Buffy's \"Watcher\", Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is well-versed in demonology and is responsible for Buffy's training as a Slayer. The group collectively refer to themselves as the Scooby Gang. During season two, Willow begins to experiment with magic, eventually becoming a formidable witch. Each season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often simplified as Buffy) presents an overall story arc which episodes tie into, as well as a specific manifestation of evil known as the Big Bad. As noted by Buffy scholar Roz Kaveney, episodes in the fourth season address authority, order, and the estrangement from the self and others as Buffy and her friends take on new roles after high school. An ongoing theme in the series is Buffy's complex relationship to her destiny as the current Slayer and how she uniquely expresses this role, and this plot element is further explored in season four in general, and in the episode \"Restless\" in particular. Season four begins with Buffy and Willow starting college, attending U.C. Sunnydale, while Xander works at a series of odd jobs and begins dating Anya Jenkins (Emma Caulfield), who lived for 1,100 years as a vengeance demon before losing her powers and getting stuck in the body of a teenager. In the fourth season, Willow becomes romantically involved with fellow-student Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), an experienced witch. The Big Bad in season four is the result of the work of a covert military force called \"The Initiative\" who are capturing and performing experiments on vampires and demons in Sunnydale. Buffy and her friends discover that chief amongst these experiments is the creation of a human-cyber-demonoid hybrid known as Adam (George Hertzberg), whose programming has gone terribly wrong, leading him to wreak havoc on the town. Buffy's challenge is to find a way to disempower him, something she and the Scoobies achieve in the penultimate episode of season four, \"Primeval\". In order to do this, the four magically join their essences together to create a single \"super Slayer\"; while the others perform a ritual, Buffy confronts and defeats Adam while mystically empowered with Giles' mind, Xander's heart, and Willow's spirit aiding her. The ritual employs four tarot-like cards: Manus (meaning hands or strength) represents Buffy, Sophus (meaning teacher or wise) represents Giles, Animus (meaning courage, or heart) represents Xander, and Spiritus (meaning spirit and magical power) represents Willow. These symbols will become relevant to the central motif in each of the episode's four dream sequences."

        "content": "Following their victory over Adam; Buffy, Xander, Willow, and Giles meet at Buffy's to relax with movies, including Apocalypse Now. They quickly fall asleep and are each confronted by the First Slayer in their dreams. Willow's dream opens with Willow painting Sappho's love poem, Hymn to Aphrodite, in Greek onto Tara's back. She then finds herself on the Sunnydale High school stage, about to perform in a radically changed Death of a Salesman, with Riley playing a cowboy, Buffy as a flapper and Harmony (a popular girl in high school who snubbed Willow, and who became a vampire at the end of Season 3) goofily trying to bite Giles' neck. Willow realizes with increasing uneasiness that she knows neither her lines nor her role. Buffy then takes Willow to stand in front of a classroom in the same nerdy clothes she wore in \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\" and \"The Harvest\" at the beginning of the series. Xander mocks her as she nervously begins to read her book report. Oz and Tara\u2014Willow's ex-boyfriend and current girlfriend\u2014flirt with each other while watching Willow recite. Suddenly, Willow is attacked and has the life sucked out of her by the First Slayer. Xander's dream begins when he wakes on Buffy's couch. After excusing himself to use the restroom, he finds himself the object of an attempted seduction by Joyce. In the restroom, he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom is attached to a large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike \u2013 unaffected by daylight \u2013 tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He tries to do so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out. Giles' dream begins with Giles swinging a watch in front of Buffy. They are in Giles' apartment, which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed. She laughs, and Giles' dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a fairground. Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks into song, giving suggestions on how to deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him. In the final dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds herself in her room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, who lives in the walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been promoted to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up. After they wake up, the four of them then discuss the significance of having tapped into the power of the First Slayer, and Buffy privately recalls Tara's words from her dream as she looks into her bedroom."

        "content": "On January 6, 1904, spinster sisters Kate and Julia Morkan and their unmarried niece, Mary Jane, host their annual Feast of Epiphany dinner party at their townhouse in Dublin. Horse-drawn carriages arrive with guests on the snowy night. First to enter are three of Mary Jane\u2019s music students, Miss Furlong, Miss O'Callaghan, and Miss Higgins, followed by young bachelors, Joseph Kerrigan and Raymond Bergin. Miss Furlong formally introduces them to Kate and her frail older sister, Julia. Kate\u2019s favorite nephew, Gabriel Conroy, and his wife, Gretta, arrive, followed by a drunken Freddy Malins. Gabriel promptly escorts Freddy to the restroom to sober him up. To Kate\u2019s consternation, Dan Brown, the group\u2019s only Protestant, also arrives in a light state of inebriation. Before dinner, the guests dance, and Bartell D\u2019Arcy, a \"celebrated tenor,\" waltzes with Gretta, as Gabriel exchanges glances with a young stranger, Molly Ivors. Meanwhile, Mrs. Malins finds her son Freddy drinking with Dan Brown, and berates him for not meeting her earlier, as she has just arrived from Scotland, where she lives with her daughter. As fellow guest, Mr. Grace, recites a poem in Irish, (\"Donal \u00d3g\") a lament of lost love, Gretta\u2019s eyes grow misty. Afterward, Kate introduces Gabriel to Molly Ivors. Dancing together, Molly, an Irish nationalist, chides Gabriel for writing at an English newspaper and not learning Irish. He declares that he is sick of Ireland. Julia entertains her guests by singing an operatic piece from her \"concert days.\" Despite her warbling voice, Freddy drunkenly gushes over her performance. Kate complains that the Pope ended her sister\u2019s singing career in the church choir when he replaced women with boys. Molly Ivors is called away for a union meeting, as the guests are called to the table, where a sumptuous feast awaits. Conversation topics range from opera to morality, and Freddy reliably utters the wrong things. Despite his nerves, Gabriel gives a rousing dinner speech praising his aunts\u2019 Irish hospitality. Later, as the party ends and guests begin to leave, Mrs. Malins asks Gabriel to look after Freddy when she returns to Scotland. Gabriel awakens Dan Brown in the coatroom and puts him in a carriage with the Malins. The remaining guests become still as D'Arcy sings \"The Lass of Aughrim,\" and Gabriel watches his wife, Gretta, standing transfixed on the stairs. She is pensive in the carriage on the way to their hotel, dismissing Gabriel\u2019s attempt to cheer her. In their room, Gretta rebuffs his urge to make love. When Gabriel asks about her behavior on the staircase, Gretta explains that she was reminded of a boy named Michael Furey who once sang \"The Lass of Aughrim\" in a pure tenor, on one of their country walks in County Galway. Gretta believes she is partly responsible for Michael\u2019s death from consumption at age seventeen: On the snowy night she was to leave for a Dublin convent, the boy left his sick bed and stood outside her window to say goodbye, and died a week later. After Gretta cries herself to asleep, Gabriel is overcome with jealousy. Watching the snowfall outside, he thinks of his foolish party speech, and his Aunt Julia\u2019s haggard appearance as she sang. He knows she will soon be dead, and imagines his aunt\u2019s body laid out, himself dressed in black as he searches for the right words to recite. Gabriel realizes that his wife\u2019s love for him is not as strong as he once thought, and wishes in turn that he felt a love as powerful as what Michael Furey seemed to feel for Gretta."

They decide to protect Dawn without telling others about it. Meanwhile, Glory easily frees herself from the collapsed factory rubble. At the hospital, Ben enters the locker room. A moment later, Glory is there and captures a Lei-Ach demon, who tells her that Buffy is the Slayer. Glory sends it and its friends to kill her. Buffy decides to leave on-campus accommodation and move back to the Summers house to be closer to her ailing mother. The gang assists with packing boxes, and Willow reminds everyone about Tara's upcoming 20th birthday. Later at The Magic Box, Buffy and Xander struggle to come up with ideas for presents for Tara, coming to the realization that they do not really know her very well. They similarly struggle to find information on Glory, since Buffy's best description that she resembles Cordelia proves too vague to be of use. A young man comes into The Magic Box and disparages magic. He reveals himself as Tara's big brother, Donny, who has come to town with their father and cousin Beth for Tara's birthday. While Tara is clearly not thrilled at their presence, she agrees to have dinner with her family that evening. Tara returns to her room to find her father there. He expresses disappointment that she has not quit magic and berates her for being out of reach for months. He reminds her (and reveals to the audience) that all women in the family show their demon selves after their 20th birthday, which is why her family has come for her. After he leaves, Willow returns and wants to repeat the demon location spell that Tara had secretly sabotaged previously. Tara fakes fatigue, so Willow returns to the magic shop. Tara secretly follows her and, from hiding, casts a spell to prevent her friends from seeing demonic manifestations of evil. Meanwhile, Riley is drinking alone in Willy's old demon bar after another argument with Buffy about her isolationism. Sandy hits on him, but he recognizes her as a vampire. In his crypt, Harmony tells Spike that the Lei-Ach demons have been summoned to kill Buffy. Spike, who had earlier been fantasizing about fighting Buffy while having sex with Harmony, leaves to help, although he tells Harmony that he is going to watch and enjoy her death. Beth finds Tara, and derides her for being \"selfish\", leaving her father and brother to fend for themselves. Beth realizes that Tara has cast a spell on her friends, then leaves to find Tara's father to inform him what his daughter has done. Three Lei-Ach demons arrive to attack Buffy, but because of Tara's spell they are invisible to the gang. They search for the Slayer and attack everyone in their path. Giles hides Dawn under a desk. Only Buffy manages to put up a decent fight. Spike arrives and fights one of the Lei-Achs, although, being demon himself, his entire scuffle is unseen by Buffy. Tara arrives, realizes her spell has gone awry, and breaks it. The demons can again be seen and are quickly beaten. Tara's family arrives and her father explains Tara's demonic heritage to her friends. Willow is visibly hurt that Tara has hidden this from her, and Tara tries to re-affirm her love for Willow. When Tara's family insists on taking her away against her wishes, all her friends make it clear they will fight to defend her, declaring that, while the Maclays may be her blood kin, her friends are her real family. Anya then asks Tara's father and Beth what kind of demon Tara is. Their refusal to give a straight answer and Mr. Maclay's puzzled look arouse Spike's suspicion, so he punches Tara in the nose, activating Spike's chip and proving that Tara is, in fact, human. Spike concludes that the legend of the Maclay women assuming their demonic heritages upon adulthood is just an old family myth maintained by the Maclay males to keep their women frightened and subordinate to them. Bolstered by the knowledge that she is fully human, Tara declares she will stay with her new family, and confidently tells her relatives to leave, which they do after a slight hesitation. Riley arrives at the birthday party and kisses Buffy. Tara opens cheesy witch-related birthday presents from the gang, and everyone mingles.

        "content": "Saturday Night Live (also known as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. Michaels currently serves as the program's showrunner. The show premiere was hosted by George Carlin on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which often parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast, with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\", properly beginning the show. In 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was then replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned. Since then, Michaels has held the job of showrunner. Many SNL cast members have found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone on to successful careers creating, writing, and starring in television and film. Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the Comcast Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, SNL has aired  episodes since its debut, and concluded its 46th season on May 22, 2021, making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States. The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films including The Blues Brothers (1980) and Wayne's World (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including home media releases of \"best of\" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show. Throughout four decades on air, Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards, including 86 Primetime Emmy Awards, four Writers Guild of America Awards, and two Peabody Awards. In 2000, it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. It was ranked tenth in TV Guides \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\" list, and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time'''s \"100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME.\" As of 2018, the show had received 252 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, the most received by any television program. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests."

        "content": "From 1965 until 1975, NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show, airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates' discretion (originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson). In 1974, Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so they could be aired during weeknights, allowing him to take time off. In 1974, NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming, Dick Ebersol, and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot. At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller, Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances that would attract 18- to 34-year-old viewers By 1975, Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, Michael O'Donoghue, Gilda Radner, and George Coe. The show was originally called NBC's Saturday Night, because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC. After the cancellation of the Cosell show, NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26, 1977. The show was originally conceived with three rotating permanent hosts: Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor, and George Carlin. According to Ebersol, consideration was given to Steve Martin and singer Linda Ronstadt also being included as a duo. When Pryor dropped out because his brand of comedy was not censor-friendly, the concept was dropped. Debuting on October 11, 1975, the show quickly developed a cult following, eventually becoming a mainstream hit and spawning (in 1978) \"Best of Saturday Night Live\" compilations that reached viewers who could not stay awake for the live broadcasts. But during the first season in 1975 and 1976, some NBC executives were not satisfied with the show's Nielsen ratings and shares. Lorne Michaels pointed out to them that Nielsen's measurement of demographics indicated that baby boomers constituted a large majority of the viewers who did commit to watching the show, and many of them watched little else on television. In 1975 and 1976, they were the most desirable demographic for television advertisers, even though Generation X was the right age for commercials for toys and other children's products. Baby boomers far outnumbered Generation X in reality but not in television viewership with the exception of Michaels's new show and major league sports, and advertisers had long been concerned about baby boomers' distaste for the powerful medium. NBC executives eventually understood Michaels's explanation of the desirable demographics and they decided to keep the show on the air despite many angry letters and phone calls the network received from viewers who were offended by certain sketches. They included a Weekend Update segment on April 24, 1976, the 18th episode, that ridiculed Aspen, Colorado murder suspect Claudine Longet and warranted an on-air apology by announcer Don Pardo during the following episode. Herminio Traviesas, a censor who was vice president of the network's Standards and Practices department, objected to cast member Laraine Newman's use of the term \"pissed off\" in the March 13, 1976, episode with host Anthony Perkins; he was in the process of placing the show on a permanent delay of several seconds, instead of live, but he changed his mind after Newman personally apologized to him. Chevy Chase left the show in November of the second season and was replaced a few months later by the then-unknown comic actor Bill Murray. Aykroyd and Belushi left the show in 1979 after the end of season four. In May 1980 (after season five), Michaels\u2014emotionally and physically exhausted\u2014requested to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time and energy to pursue other projects. Concerned the show would be canceled without him, Michaels suggested writers Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Downey as his replacements. NBC president Fred Silverman disliked Franken and was infuriated by Franken's Weekend Update routine called \"A Limo For A Lame-O\", a scathing critique of Silverman's job performance at the network and his insistence on traveling by limousine at the network's expense. Silverman blamed Michaels for approving this Weekend Update segment. Unable to get the deal he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount Pictures, intending to take his associate producer, Jean Doumanian, with him. Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at SNL after being recommended by her friend, NBC vice president Barbara Gallagher. Michaels's departure led to most of the cast and writing staff leaving the show. The reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. Jean Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months, and NBC immediately cut the show's budget from the previous $1\u00a0million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michaels's place. The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect to the original cast's replacements, such as Charles Rocket and Ann Risley. Doumanian's fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said \"fuck\" on live television. After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed. Although executives suggested SNL be left to die, Brandon Tartikoff, who succeeded Silverman as network chief in mid-1981, wanted to keep the show on the air, believing the concept was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol as his choice for the new producer. Ebersol previously had been fired by Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels's approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian's tenure. Ebersol's tenure saw commercial success, but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era, except for the breakout of new cast member Eddie Murphy during the 1980\u201381 sixth season. Murphy, the main draw of the cast, left in 1984 to pursue his already successful film career, and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast. He broke with history by hiring established comedians such as Billy Crystal and Martin Short who could bring their already successful material to the show. Ebersol's final year with this new cast is considered one of the series' funniest, but had strayed far from the precedent-shattering show Michaels had created. After that season, Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp, including departing from the show's established \"live\" format. Following unsuccessful forays into film and television, in need of money, and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show, Michaels finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted out. The show was again recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol's idea to seek out established actors such as Joan Cusack and Robert Downey Jr. The cast and writers struggled creatively and, in April 1986, Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show, until he was convinced by producer Bernie Brillstein to give it one more year. The show was renewed but for the first time in its history, for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty-two. Michaels again fired most of the cast and, learning his lesson from the previous seasons, sought out unknown talent such as Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman instead of known names. The show ran successfully again until it lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 1994. Wanting to increase SNLs ratings and profitability, then-NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer and other executives began to actively interfere in the show, recommending that new stars such as Chris Farley and Adam Sandler be fired (because Ohlmeyer did not \"get\" them) and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live. The show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast, in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels's position. Michaels received a lucrative offer to develop a Saturday night project for CBS during this time, but remained loyal to SNL. 1995 saw the biggest upheaval in the cast in nearly a decade. Popular cast member Mike Myers left after five years, and Farley and Sandler, among others, were fired. A mostly new cast featuring Will Ferrell, Cheri Oteri and Darrell Hammond was hired for the new season. The show focused on performers, and writers were forced to supply material for the cast's existing characters before they could write original sketches. By 1997, Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting Michaels's independence, forcing the removal of writer Jim Downey and cast member Norm Macdonald."

        "content": "The original 1975 cast of SNL, titled \"The Not Ready For Prime-Time Players,\" a term coined by writer Herb Sargent, included Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris, and Chevy Chase. Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself. Although Chase became a performer, he was hired on a one-year writer contract and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him, allowing him to leave the show after the first season in 1976. Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels. Morris was initially brought in as a writer, but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast, where he turned in a successful performance. Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired. Belushi had a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows, but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner and writers Anne Beatts and Michael O'Donoghue. Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi, believing he would be a source of trouble for the show, but Beatts, O'Donoghue, and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion. After Chase left the show, he was replaced by Bill Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast but was unable to because of budget restrictions. When Chase returned to host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded by the rest of the cast, and Chase came to blows shortly before the show. Chase's departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he took the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy Animal House and later refused to allow SNL musician Paul Shaffer to participate in The Blues Brothers (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers. Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi's independent successes. Radner had a one-woman Broadway show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy Meatballs. In 1980, Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests and was replaced by Doumanian, who wanted to give the show a fresh start with a new cast and writing staff. Michaels was followed out the door by the remaining original cast, Curtin, Newman, Radner, Morris, Murray, and additional cast members. The Doumanian-era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast and was not received favorably. Ebersol fired the majority of her hires, except for two unknown comedians: Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show and, after seeing him audition, Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of Robert Townsend. Doumanian wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy. Doumanian also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show. Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge, after which Murphy was credited with much of that era's success. Murphy's star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films such as 48 Hrs. and Trading Places, before leaving for his film career in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 1983\u201384 season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material, but at an inflated cost; Billy Crystal and Martin Short were paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode, respectively, a far cry from earlier salaries. Michaels's return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured talent such as Robert Downey Jr., Jon Lovitz, and Dennis Miller. The season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Michaels kept Lovitz, Miller, and Nora Dunn, and brought in new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, and Jan Hooks, who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s. In 1989\u201390, new talent such as Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, and Chris Farley was added. Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent, increasing competition for limited screen time. By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had left, taking with them a virtual army of characters; Myers quit for his movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a largely new cast including Will Ferrell, Cheri Oteri and Darrell Hammond. Within a few years, Jimmy Fallon and Tina Fey also joined the cast. While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, with the addition of six cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, and Fred Armisen. As of Season 46, SNL has featured 156 cast members including, besides the above-mentioned players, Rachel Dratch, Amy Poehler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Will Forte, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tracy Morgan, Chris Parnell, Maya Rudolph, Andy Samberg, Kristen Wiig, and many others. Kenan Thompson is the show's longest-serving cast member. Thompson first joined the series in 2003 and has been on the show for eighteen seasons. Those selected to join the cast of SNL are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings (Newman, Ferrell, Hartman, Lovitz, Wiig and The Second City (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey, Tim Meadows), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, Norm Macdonald), who already possess the training or experience necessary for SNL. Of the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of Weekend Update, a segment that has alternated between having one or two hosts and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time. Many of the Weekend Update hosts have gone on to find greater success outside the show, including Chase, Curtin, Murray, Miller, Macdonald, Fey, Fallon, and Poehler. From 2008, Seth Meyers was the solo host of Weekend Update, before being partnered with Cecily Strong in 2013. After Meyers left for Late Night with Seth Meyers in February 2014, Strong was paired with head writer Colin Jost. However, later that year, she was replaced by writer Michael Che. The cast is divided into two tiers: the more established group of repertory players; and newer, unproven cast members known as featured players, who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable. The cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show, but starting with the 1999\u20132000 season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom. Cast members are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years. The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on SNL and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast, such as Mike Myers and Adam Sandler, gained fame on SNL only to leave and make money for other studios. In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported to be contracted to SNL for a total of seven years. The contracts also contain a network option that allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time. In the first season of the show, the cast was paid $750 per episode, rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four. By the late 1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000 and $5,500 per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional $1,500 per episode for writing a sketch that made it to air. In 2001, Ferrell became the highest-paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season (approximately $17,500 per episode). In 2014, Sasheer Zamata was added as a cast member in mid-season after criticism of the show's lack of an African-American woman."

Porky practices with his rifle, frightens his dog, Rover and shoots a man upstairs, who comes down to punch Porky in the snout. At a lake, Porky spies a duck, but other duck hunters suddenly appear and shoot at it for several seconds. They all miss. A cross-eyed duck hunter tries to shoot the same duck but instead shoots down two planes. Porky puts out duck decoys. Daffy arrives and blends among them. Porky wears a decoy on his head, walks underwater and tries to shoot Daffy, but the gun shoots out water instead of bullets. Daffy then flies onto a floating barrel of poison (labeled 'XXX' \u2013 a period designation for whiskey). Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes. Some fish are attracted to the poison and get drunk. The fish come onshore, commandeer a boat and drunkenly sing 'On Moonlight Bay'. Daffy bites Porky on the nose as he peers through the grass. Porky shoots Daffy down and instructs Rover to bring the duck back, but when he comes back, it's Daffy carrying the dog and throwing him back on the bank. Porky whips out a notepad, leafs through it and notes that this scene 'wasn't in the script'. Daffy yells out his first words, that he is \"just a crazy, darn fool duck\", and proceeds to do his signature 'crazy dance' on the lake. After a humorous scene where Daffy eats an electric eel and shocks himself, Porky tries hunting from a rowboat but is taunted by the ducks when he stops for lunch. In his hurry to fire at them he inadvertently sinks the boat, cueing Joe Penner to rise from underneath the water with his signature line \"You wanna buy a duck?\" Alerted by Rover that Daffy is back, Porky makes several attempts to cock the gun and shoot, but when Daffy covers his ears with his hands once again the gun fails to fire each time. Daffy comes out of the water, takes the gun and fires it after the first cock. Daffy takes to the air and is met by Porky shooting his gun rapid-fire and being driven into the ground by the recoil, apparently not hitting anything. Porky tries to use a duck call, but the other duck hunters mistake it for a real duck and shoot at Porky. Disgusted, Porky throws the duck call to the ground, but it bounces and Rover accidentally swallows it. Rover gets the hiccups, quacking with each one, drawing constant fire and forcing Porky and Rover to flee from the lake. Porky and Rover trudge home, disappointed with their failure to bag a duck. When Porky gets home, he sees the ducks outside doing a trapeze act in the sky at his window. Porky tries to shoot them with his gun but, thinking the gun is empty, throws the shotgun to the floor. The gun fires into the ceiling, getting the guy from upstairs to come and punch Porky in the snout again. The cartoon ends with Daffy dancing and bouncing around the \"That's All Folks!\" title card."

It also concerns Pete's best friend, Al Yackey (Goodman), a fellow firefighter pilot. After yet another risky and nearly fatal flight that Pete casually shrugs off, Al suggests he accept a safer job training firefighting pilots in Flat Rock, Colorado. Pete refuses until Dorinda tearfully confronts him, confessing her perpetual fear and anguish that he will be killed. Pete relents and tells Dorinda he will take the training job. Pete flies one last mission, despite Dorinda's gloomy premonition. During the fire bombing run, Al's engine catches fire and is about to explode. Pete makes a dangerously steep dive and skillfully douses Al's engine with a fire-retardant slurry, saving Al. As Pete struggles to regain control from the dive, he flies directly through the forest fire, igniting his own engine and causing the aircraft to explode. Pete strolls through a burnt-out forest. Coming to a small clearing, he meets Hap (Hepburn), who explains Pete died in the explosion and now has a new purpose: As spirits did for him during his lifetime, he will provide Spiritus (\"the divine breath\") to guide others who will interpret his words as their own thoughts. Although time is non-linear from Pete's perspective, six months have elapsed in the real world  and Al wants a grieving Dorinda to move past Pete's death. He takes her with him to Colorado to work at the flight school where Pete was to command pilots who will be training to fight fires, one of which is Ted Baker (Johnson). More months pass and, to Pete's anguish, Ted falls in love with Dorinda as she begins emerging from her year-long mourning. Pete attempts to sabotage the budding romance, but Hap reminds him that his life ended; he was sent to inspire Ted, but also to bid Dorinda farewell. Ted, with Pete's inspiration, plans a dangerous rescue mission of trapped firefighters. Unable to bear another loss, Dorinda takes Ted's aircraft to do the job herself. Pete, unseen by Dorinda, fails to dissuade her. However, with Pete's guidance, Dorinda is able to save the firefighters who are trapped on the ground. On the return flight, Pete tells her everything he wanted to say in life. Dorinda makes an emergency water landing in a lake. As the sinking plane's cockpit floods, Dorinda seems reluctant to escape. Pete appears before her and, offering his hand, leads her to the surface. As Dorinda, now alone, wades ashore, Pete releases her heart to allow Ted to replace him. Dorinda walks back to the airbase and embraces Ted. Pete smiles and heads in the opposite direction to assume his place in the hereafter."

Meanwhile, in a farm outside Washington, D.C., widowed farmer Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) and his brother George (Simon Rex) discover a crop circle, saying \"Attack Here!\", after noticing the dogs' strange activity. Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), now a reporter, announces the crop circles on the news. She picks up her paranormally endowed nephew Cody from school, where her best friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) is his teacher. George picks up his niece Sue, who is in the same class. Cindy and George quickly become attracted to one another, and George invites her and Brenda to a rap-battle with his rapper friends Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart). George proves to be talented but is violently thrown out after he raises his unintentionally pointy white hood. After watching the cursed videotape, Brenda asks Cindy to keep her company. After playing several pranks on Cindy, the girl from the cursed tape, Tabitha, fights with and kills Brenda. George receives a phone call about the death, and Tom meets with Sayaman, who apologizes for the accident involving himself and Tom's wife Annie. During Brenda's wake, George and Mahalik wreak havoc in an unsuccessful attempt to revive her, only to blow up her body and get kicked out of the house. Cindy finds the cursed tape in Brenda's room, watches it, and receives a phone call warning her of her death in seven days. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help. CJ says his Aunt Shaneequa might be able to help. Shaneequa (Queen Latifah), the Matrix Oracle, and her husband Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) agree to watch the tape with her. Shaneequa discovers the hidden image of a lighthouse and gets in a fight with Tabitha's mother. Shaneequa tells Cindy to find the lighthouse to break the curse. When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody watched the tape. At work, Cindy searches through pictures of lighthouses before finding the one from the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter. Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson, and President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen) personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect (George Carlin). The loquacious old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster believing it was Pootie Tang, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race. Returning home, Cindy discovers her station has been broadcasting the evil tape for hours, and there have been various sightings of aliens around the world. Worse, Cody is missing. Cindy tracks him to the Logan farm, where he has taken refuge with George. Tom orders everybody into the basement for safety, as he, George and Mahalik go outside to fight the extraterrestrials. The aliens (Tom Kenny) arrive but reveal they are friendly and have come to stop Tabitha, since they accidentally watched the tape on a broadcast they had intercepted, again believing it was Pootie Tang. In the basement, Cindy recognizes the farm's cellar from the tape, and she finds the well where Tabitha drowned. Suddenly, Tabitha appears behind her. A short fight ensues, during which Tabitha takes Cody hostage. Cindy and George appeal to her, offering her a place in their family. Tabitha transforms into a little girl and claims her curse is broken, but changes back to her monstrous form and says she was \u201cjust screwing on them\u201d. As she advances on Cindy and the others, President Harris opens a door and accidentally knocks her into the well. The aliens leave in peace, and Cindy and George get married. Leaving for their honeymoon, they realize they left Cody behind. After Cindy avoids hitting Cody at an intersection, Cody breathes a sigh of relief and another car strikes him."

Robots was theatrically released on March 11, 2005. It grossed $260.7 million worldwide against a $75 million budget and received praise for its animation, humor and voice performances."

        "content": "In a world populated by sentient robots, Rodney Copperbottom, son of Herb and Lydia Copperbottom from Rivet Town, is an aspiring young inventor. He idolizes Bigweld, a famous inventor, entrepreneur, and philanthropist whose company, Bigweld Industries, hires other inventors and provides robots with spare parts. Following Bigweld's example to \"see a need, fill a need\", Rodney develops a small, flying robot, named Wonderbot, to assist his father, Herb, who works as a dishwasher at a restaurant. When Herb's supervisor Mr. Gunk confronts them, Wonderbot malfunctions and wreaks havoc in the kitchen. To help Herb pay for the damages, Rodney decides to move to Robot City, hoping to present Wonderbot to Bigweld Industries. Upon his arrival, Rodney is ejected from Bigweld Industries by the company's current head Phineas T. Ratchet, who, in Bigweld's absence, has stopped producing spare parts and inventions in favor of expensive \"upgrades\", thereby \"outmoding\" robots who are unable or unwilling to pay for them. Ratchet's mother, Madame Gasket, runs the Chop Shop, a facility that collects scrap and spare parts (and sometimes outmoded robots) and melts them to create ingots for Upgrades. Rodney befriends Fender Pinwheeler, a ne'er-do-well he met at the train station. Fender takes him in to a boarding home populated by other outmodes, known collectively as the \"Rusties\". Word of Rodney's mechanical prowess spreads, and he is hailed as a local hero after he and the Rusties fix outmodes throughout the neighborhood, although they are eventually unable to cope with the demand due to the spare part shortage. Hoping to enlist Bigweld's help, Rodney and Fender infiltrate the Bigweld Ball \u2013 where Bigweld usually makes an appearance \u2013 only for Ratchet to announce that Bigweld will not attend. Enraged, Rodney publicly berates Ratchet, who orders his security team to eliminate him. Cappy, a Bigweld Industries executive opposed to Ratchet's plans, rescues Rodney and Fender. Fender is captured by a Sweeper, a vehicle that collects scrap metal and outmodes, and taken to the Chop Shop where he discovers Gasket and Ratchet's plan to use a heavily-armed fleet of Super-Sweepers to destroy all outmodes throughout the city to make and sell more ingots. Meanwhile, Rodney and Cappy fly to Bigweld's mansion, where they eventually find Bigweld and tell him what has been going on. Bigweld reveals Ratchet's greed and business sense won over his idealism in the management of Bigweld Industries, and tells Rodney and Cappy to leave. Crushed, Rodney calls his parents and plans to return to Rivet Town. Herb encourages Rodney to fight for his dreams, or he will spend the rest of his life regretting it like Herb did. Fender returns upon escaping from the Chop Shop and reveals Ratchet and Gasket's plot. Rodney rallies Cappy and the Rusties to stop them. They are joined by Bigweld, who has regained his resolve after realizing how much he and his ideals meant to Rodney. The group returns to Bigweld Industries where Bigweld fires Ratchet, who ultimately knocks him unconscious, planning on melting him down as well. Rodney, Cappy, and Wonderbot rescue Bigweld from Ratchet and escape with the Rusties in a security vehicle with Ratchet close behind. Rodney unclips Ratchet\u2019s vehicle to break free, but their vehicle loses control in front of the Chop Shop and Bigweld is rolled inside. Refusing to give up, Rodney upgrades the Rusties to rescue Bigweld. Rodney, Cappy, and the Rusties, alongside an army of outmodes that Rodney had repaired earlier, battle Ratchet, Gasket, and their army of workers. Rodney and Bigweld immobilize the Super-Sweepers and defeat Ratchet, who accidentally kills Gasket by knocking her into the incinerator while trying to escape. Ratchet is accidentally stripped of his upgrades, being left chained to the ceiling with his father. Taking control of Bigweld Industries once again, Bigweld promises to make spare parts available to everyone. Later, he holds a public ceremony in Rivet Town, where he nominates Rodney as his new second-in-command and eventual successor. Rodney provides Herb with new replacement parts and a flugelhorn-like instrument to fulfill his dream of being a musician. After a shaky start, Herb leads Rodney, Cappy, the Rusties, Bigweld and the townspeople in a rousing rendition of \"Get Up Offa That Thing\"."

The film says this bias belies the channel's motto of being \"Fair and Balanced\". The documentary had a limited theatrical release, was distributed in DVD format by the political action committee MoveOn.org, and was sold online through Internet retailers such as Amazon.com.  MoveOn.org had helped promote the DVD release by taking out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times. Following the release of Outfoxed, Greenwald and Brave New Films produced a related series of anti-Fox viral videos, collectively entitled Fox Attacks. In an interview, Greenwald stated his goal in making the film: \"What we set out to do was to show that, in fact, the entire Fox News was not a news organization. The goal was not just to change that narrative but to change the impact that Fox News often had on legitimate journalists.\""

        "content": "The USS Enterprise arrives at the pergium mining colony on planet Janus VI to help the colony deal with an unknown creature that has killed 50 miners and engineers, and destroyed equipment with a strong corrosive substance. Captain Kirk, Spock, and McCoy meet with the mine supervisor, Chief Engineer Vanderberg. During the briefing, Spock's attention is drawn to a silicon nodule on Vanderberg's desk, which Vanderberg dismisses as a geological oddity. They are alerted to a problem in the colony's nuclear reactor, and find its guard killed and the main circulating pump stolen. The part has long since gone out of production, so no replacements are available. Chief Engineer Scott jury rigs a substitute, but it fails shortly thereafter, necessitating the missing part be found and reinstalled before the reactor goes super-critical in 10 hours. Kirk and his security team search for the creature. Spock, suspecting it may be a silicon based lifeform, modifies their phasers to be more effective against silicon. They encounter the creature\u2014which has the appearance of molten rock\u2014and fire upon it, breaking a piece of it off. The creature flees by burrowing through a rock wall. Spock analyzes the fragment, whose composition resembles fibrous asbestos. He deduces that it burrows through solid rock by secreting the same corrosive substance that has killed the miners. Spock adjusts his tricorder to scan for silicon-based life, and confirms that the creature is the only such lifeform for miles. Kirk and Spock happen upon a chamber containing thousands of the silicon nodules. The creature causes a cave-in that separates Kirk from Spock. Though Spock urges Kirk to kill it, Kirk observes the creature backs off whenever he aims his phaser at it. Spock finds a way around the cave-in and joins Kirk. He attempts a mind meld with the creature, but perceives little but intense pain. The creature etches the ambiguous message \"NO KILL I\" into a rock, having gained some knowledge of human language from the meld. By making physical contact with the creature, Spock establishes a deeper mind meld. He learns that the creature is called a Horta, and that its species dies out completely every 50,000 years, save for one individual that remains alive to protect the eggs, which are the silicon nodules. As the nodule eggs hatch, the single adult Horta acts as a protectant mother to this next generation. Though nearing death because of her wound, the Horta communicates through Spock, telling them the location of the stolen pump. There Kirk also discovers thousands of broken eggs which were destroyed by the miners as worthless. The miners arrive and attempt to attack the creature. Kirk and Spock stop them, explaining that it was only protecting its eggs when it killed humans. Dr. McCoy successfully treats the Horta's wound using a silicon-based cement normally used for building emergency shelters. The miners fear the prospect of thousands of Horta, but Kirk convinces them that the Horta are peaceful and could collaborate with the miners by tunneling for them. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy return to the Enterprise, prepare to leave orbit, and learn from Vanderberg that the eggs have hatched and already the new Horta have uncovered rich veins of pergium and other valuable metals."

        "content": "Comedian Albert Brooks (played by himself) leads a documentary film project meant to encapsulate the joys, sorrows and intimacy of real life by filming a regular american family at all times for a full year using expensive cameras: some installed on walls and four large helmet-like ones worn by a small camera crew that follows Brooks and the family in and out of their neighboring homes (a regular film crew is hired by the studio but aren\u2019t needed.) After countless testing, two families are declared \u2018\u2019perfect\u2019\u2019: the Feltons and the Yeagers. Brooks tells the audience that the Feltons are the clear pick because they live in Wisconsin and the Yeagers live in Arizona. The studio picks the Yeagers. The Yeagers are sent on vacation and filming starts as soon as they arrive back at the airport, causing immediate nervousness in the family. Brooks takes an hour off to do antiquing while the Yeagers have pizza and argue about rules at the dinner table. The father, Warren, makes a few unsympathetic remarks and ends up eating alone. Doctors Howard Hill and Ted Cleary are there to observe the project\u2019s integrity and progress. Cleary does not appreciate Brooks\u2019 intrusive method of constantly filming the family, worrying that their hold of reality is being threatened. The mother, Jeanette, leaves the house without cameras to unwind and meets Brooks later to thank him by inviting him to an appointment at the gynecologist. Brooks is thrilled until Jeanette kisses him, which he dislikes. He warns her that he\u2019s no better than her husband and that his charisma \u2018\u2019doesn\u2019t run deep.\u2019\u2019 The gynecologist refuses to be on camera because of a damning news story that ran about him years ago. Brooks offers him $500 to accept but then recognizes the man as \u2018\u2019the baby broker\u2019\u2019 from the news story and the deal is off. Warren brings the crew to witness a day at his work as a veterinarian. Being nervous from the cameras, he starts surgery on a horse by accidentally ordering an anesthetic drug twice and killing the animal instantly. He asks Brooks to not show the footage in the film but Brooks won\u2019t sign off on that. Jeannette\u2019s grandmother also dies and the family enters a deep depression. In trying to cheer the family up, Brooks invites Jeanette to a dinner date which she declines, having changed her mind on her attraction to him. Brooks then shows up to the house in a clown costume to cheer the kids but they are at school. While still in costume, Brooks is asked to sit down with Warren and Jeannette, where Warren confesses to feeling a nervous breakdown. Brooks is dismissive of the claim, saying that it\u2019s okay to be sad and confused as long as you don\u2019t \u2018\u2019clam up\u2019\u2019. After a meeting with the doctors, some scientists from the institute and an old-timey film producer obsessed with getting movie stars involved, Dr. Cleary leaves the project, disapproving of how the family is being treated. The family return to a happier, more harmonious lifestyle until Cleary\u2019s book on the project is published, calling it \u2018\u2019mind-control\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019psychological rape\u2019\u2019. The book attracts attention on the family from newscasters, much to the anger of Brooks and the discomfort of the Yeagers. Another meeting with Dr. Hill, the institute and the film producer calls for the termination of the project. Brooks brings The Yeagers to the meeting and, to his surprise, they also want to end the project. Despite his pleas and threats for them to stay, they do not change their minds and the producer calls for the Yeagers to be paid anyway to apologize for the stress they endured. Brooks suggests to start the project over with the Feltons back in Wisconsin but is turned down by the producer. While dressing back into the clown costume for a benefit at a children\u2019s hospital, Brooks starts losing his mind over the project. In a desperate attempt to find a solid ending to the film, Brooks recalls the endings of famous films and picks  Gone With The Wind as the one he should copy. He burns down the Yeagers house with elation in front of them, the camera crew and the scientists. No one is harmed. An epilogue is presented in text form saying that the house was rebuilt with a tennis court added for \u2018appreciation\u2019, that Dr. Cleary\u2019s book sold poorly and he is now ill. Real-life historians are invited to call 1-800-555-3824, should they want documentation on the project."

An idea is not enough for a movie. Characters have to be developed, comic situations have to be set up before they can pay off and the story should have a conclusion instead of a dead stop. 'Real Life' fails in all of those areas \u2014 fails so miserably that it lets its audiences down.\" Conversely, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the film as an \"often very funny assault on manners, moviemaking, an allegedly typical American family and everything its members hold dear ... Its manner is deadpan and sly, so sly that some viewers may not find it comic at all. But for anyone well-disposed toward Mr. Brooks, who is never without his absolute insincerity and irrational good cheer, 'Real Life' is full of delightful nonsense, a very funny account of one man's crusade to capture all the truth and wisdom that money can buy.\" Variety noted, \"Expanding on the deadpan satiric tone of the short parodies and pseudo-documentaries he's filmed in the past for NBC's 'Saturday Night Live' into his first feature, Albert Brooks has come up with a mostly very funny (though uneven) take-off on social-minded docu filmmaking that stands to draw boxoffice support from the young adult, primarily college crowd that's made the late-night tv show the success it is.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"Admittedly, documentary filmmaking doesn't sound like the greatest subject to be satirized, but 'Real Life' is full of undeniable laughs.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called Grodin \"wonderful to watch\" and thought that the film \"generates some spectacular moments,\" but \"the movie, like the experiment, runs out of steam well before it is finished and, like many a promising routine, is stuck for a sock ending.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post stated, \"Albert Brooks may be the Woody Allen of the 1980s. His extraordinary first feature, 'Real Life,' demonstrates a potential genius for movie comedy and is animated by a peculiarly fertile and subtle imagination.\" David Ansen of Newsweek wrote that the film \"doesn't quite come off, for all its funny ideas. It feels like a 30-minute gag stretched to fill a feature film, and the repetitiousness of the situation gets wearisome. It's a one-note movie, and Brooks's performance doesn't help: he's like an aggressive emcee who doesn't know when to shut up and turn the show over to his guests. That may be the point, but it's also the problem.\" As of October 2020, Real Life holds a rating of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 6.66/10."

On her deathbed, the queen promises an androgynous, young nobleman named Orlando a large tract of land and a castle built on it, along with a generous monetary gift; both Orlando and his heirs would keep the land and inheritance forever, but Elizabeth will bequeath it to him only if he assents to an unusual command: \"Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.\" Orlando acquiesces and reposes in splendid isolation in the castle for a couple of centuries during which time he dabbles in poetry and art. His attempts to befriend a celebrated poet backfire when the poet ridicules his verse. Orlando then travels to Constantinople as English ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, and is almost killed in a diplomatic fracas. Waking seven days later, he learns something startling: He has transformed into a woman. The now Lady Orlando comes home to her estate in Middle-Eastern attire, only to learn that she faces several impending lawsuits arguing that Orlando was a woman all along and therefore has no right to the land or any of the royal inheritance that the queen had promised. The succeeding two centuries tire Orlando; the court case, bad luck in love, and the wars of British history eventually bring the story to the present day (i.e., the early 1990s). Orlando now has a young daughter in tow and is in search of a publisher for her book. (The literary editor who judges the work as \"quite good\" is portrayed by Heathcote Williams\u2014the same actor who played the poet who had, earlier in the film, denigrated Orlando's poetry.) Having lived a most bizarre existence, Orlando, relaxing with her daughter, points out to her an angel."

        "content": "Director Sally Potter described her approach to the adaptation as follows: My task...was to find a way of remaining true to the spirit of the book and to Virginia Woolf's intentions, whilst being ruthless with changing the book in any way necessary to make it work cinematically...The most immediate changes were structural. The storyline was simplified [and] any events which did not significantly further Orlando's story were dropped. The film contains some anachronisms not present in the novel. For example, upon Orlando's arrival in Constantinople in about the year 1700, England is referred to as a \"green and pleasant land\", a line from William Blake's Jerusalem, which in reality was not written until 1804. Also, Orlando receives a gift to celebrate the new century from Queen Anne, who had in fact not yet succeeded to the throne. Potter argued that \"whereas the novel could withstand abstraction and arbitrariness (such as Orlando's change of sex), cinema is more pragmatic.\" She continued,There had to be reasons\u2014however flimsy\u2014to propel us along a journey based itself on a kind of suspension of disbelief. Thus, Queen Elizabeth bestows Orlando's long life upon him...whereas in the book it remains unexplained. And Orlando's change of sex in the film is the result of his having reached a crisis point\u2014a crisis of masculine identity.At film's end, Orlando has a daughter, whereas in the novel she had a son. Potter said that she intended Orlando's breaking the fourth wall to be an equivalent to Woolf's direct addresses to her readers, and that this was her attempt at converting Woolf's literary wit into a more 'cinematic' humour. One obvious similarity remained, however: The film ends in its present day, 1992, just as Woolf's novel ends in its present day, 1928."

Blix and his colleagues Pox and Blunder follow impetuous Princess Lili as she visits her forest-dwelling paramour Jack O'Greene, and she learns how to talk to animals from him. After many failed attempts to progress their relationship, Jack blindfolds and takes Lili to the lair of the unicorns. As Lili distracts the stallion by stroking him, Blix shoots him with a poison dart from his blowpipe, and the unicorns flee. With the couple unaware of the goblins, Lili makes light of Jack's fears concerning her sin and sets him a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring she will marry whoever finds it. While Jack dives in after the ring, the goblins find the dying stallion and sever his alicorn. An apocalyptic winter descends; Lili runs off in terror and Jack is barely able to break through the surface of the now frozen pond. Lili takes refuge in the frozen cottage of a kind and friendly family. There, Lili sees the goblins testing the alicorn's magical powers, and overhears from them about how she had a role in their slaying of the stallion, and by doing so, casting the dark winter onto the world. She follows the goblins to a rendezvous with Darkness, who tells them the world cannot be cast into eternal night as long as the surviving mare still lives. Blunder valiantly but unsuccessfully tries using the alicorn to overthrow Darkness and is taken away to his castle. Meanwhile, Jack, accompanied by the forest elf Honeythorn Gump, the fairy Oona, and the dwarves Brown Tom and Screwball, finds the mare mourning the lifeless stallion. Lamenting over his role in their current predicament, Jack apologizes to the mare, who tells him the alicorn must be recovered and returned to the stallion. Leaving Brown Tom to guard the unicorns, Jack and the others retrieve a hidden cache of ancient weapons and armor. While they are gone, Lili tries to make things right by helping to save the mare from the goblins, but they overpower Brown Tom and capture both the mare and Lili. Learning of what has transpired, Jack and his group make their way to the castle in the middle of a swamp. On the way, they are nearly killed by a swamp hag named Meg Mucklebones, but defeat her by flattering her appearance and then decapitating her. After reaching the castle, Jack's group falls into an underground prison cell in a hellish kitchen. They encounter Blunder in the same cell, revealed to be an elf gone astray, before he is dragged off by an ogre cook to be baked into a pie. Oona uses her magic to escape their cell and retrieves the keys to free the others. Having fallen in love with Lili, Darkness tempts her with jewelry, a beautiful dress and promises of power and glory. Seemingly seduced, she agrees to wed him under the condition that she will be the one to kill the mare in the upcoming ritual. Overhearing their conversation, Jack and Gump learn that Darkness can be destroyed by daylight. After saving Blunder, the group takes the ogres' giant metal platters as makeshift mirrors to reflect the sunlight to the chamber where the mare is to be sacrificed. As the ritual begins, Lili frees the mare, but is knocked out by Darkness. While the others relay the light of the setting sun using the platters, Jack fights Darkness in combat, finally wounding him with the severed alicorn. As the redirected sunlight blasts him to the edge of a void, Darkness warns them that because evil lurks in all beings, he will never truly be vanquished. Jack hesitates as he realizes this to be true, but overcomes his doubt and severs the evil hand holding the alicorn, thus expelling Darkness into the void. Gump returns the stallion's horn, returning him to life and ending the winter. Jack retrieves the mystic ring from the pond and returns it to Lili, returning her to life."

Jack, happy with this request for the first time, accepts. Lili returns to her home to assume her responsibilities, promising to visit him again. Jack happily runs off into the sunset, hailed by the forest fairies and the revived unicorns. In the American theatrical version, Jack and Lili assure each other of their love and watch the unicorns reunite, and they run off into the sunset together, hailed by the forest fairies and the unicorns. Darkness watches them from the void, laughing. The European version also ends with both Jack and Lili running off into the sunset, but without Darkness's final appearance."

        "content": "Frank Martin is a former special operations soldier and now highly skilled driver/mercenary residing in southern France whose callsign is \"The Transporter\". He strictly follows three rigid rules when transporting: Never change the deal. No names. Never open the package. In Nice, Frank is hired to transport three bank robbers with his black BMW 735i, but they hoist a fourth man in his car after the robbery. Explaining the extra weight will affect his precisely planned getaway, he refuses to drive until, in desperation, the leader kills one of his men who is pushed out of the car. Later they offer more money for Frank to drive them to Avignon. He refuses the deal. The robbers escape in another car, but are foiled by their amateur driving. At Frank's villa on the French Riviera, local Police Inspector Tarconi questions Frank about the black BMW that fled the scene of the robbery Frank was the getaway driver for. Lacking any real proof, Tarconi leaves. Frank is then hired to deliver a package of  to an American, Darren \"Wall Street\" Bettencourt. The package is loaded into Frank's trunk. While changing a flat tire, Frank notices the package moving. Realizing a person is inside, he violates his third rule in order to give the person something to drink. He discovers a woman, tied up and gagged. She attempts to escape but Frank recaptures her and returns her to the trunk along with two policemen who spot them. Frank delivers the package to Bettencourt as promised and agrees to another job, transporting a briefcase. As he stops to buy drinks for the cops in his trunk, a bomb hidden in the briefcase explodes. Out for vengeance, Frank returns to Bettencourt's villa where he kills and wounds several henchmen. Frank then steals a car (a Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse) to get away, only to find \"the package\" bound and gagged in the back seat. He brings the young woman, whose name is Lai, back to his house. Bettencourt visits one of his surviving men in hospital in order to determine who attacked his residence, before killing the man after discovering that Frank is alive. The next day, Tarconi arrives and asks about Frank's car, which Frank claims was stolen. Lai supports Frank's alibi by introducing herself as his new cook and girlfriend. Tarconi again leaves with no concrete evidence. Shortly after, Bettencourt's hitmen fire missiles and automatic weapons down on the house. Frank and Lai barely escape through an underwater passage to a nearby safe house. Later, while being questioned at the police station, Lai accesses Tarconi's computer to find information on Bettencourt. Frank, presumed dead by Bettencourt wants to rebuild his villa and start a new life and advises Lai to do so too before she tells him that Bettencourt is a human trafficker with 400 Chinese trapped in shipping containers,  including her family. Lai and Frank go to Bettencourt's office, where Bettencourt reveals that Lai's father, Kwai, is also a human trafficker and Bettencourt's partner in crime. Kwai arrives and his henchmen subdue Frank. When Tarconi arrives, Kwai and Bettencourt accuse Frank of kidnapping Lai. Tarconi has Frank arrested and locked up in the station. Realizing Frank would not be constrained by search warrants and that he would be able to solve the case faster than the police, Tarconi agrees to aid Frank's escape as his faux hostage and releases him at the harbour of Cassis. Frank then tracks the criminals to the docks in Marseille, where they load the containers onto trucks. However, Frank is spotted and forced to fight his way through the guards, and fails to stop the trucks. He then steals an old car and makes chase at dawn before it breaks down on a small country road. He then commandeers a small airplane from a farmer and follows the highway to the trucks where he parachutes onto one of them. After a lengthy fight, Frank manages to kill Bettencourt by throwing him out of the moving truck and also some of his henchmen, only to be ambushed by Kwai once he gets out of the truck where he is marched to a cliff edge. However, Frank is saved when Lai reluctantly shoots her father. Afterwards, Tarconi arrives with the police, and they rescue the people trapped inside the two containers as he congratulates Frank on his work."

Both their mother and grandmother live with them. After running home after a fight with each other, the boys are shocked to discover their father has returned after a 12-year absence. With their mother's uneasy blessing, Ivan and Andrei set out on what they believe will be a simple fishing vacation with him. Andrei is delighted to be reunited with their father and Ivan is apprehensive towards the man whom they know only from a faded photograph. At first, both brothers are pleased with the prospect of an exciting adventure, but they soon strain under the weight of their father's awkward and increasingly brutal efforts to make up for the missing decade. Ivan and Andrei find themselves alternately tested, rescued, scolded, mentored, scrutinized, and ignored by the man. Andrei seems to look up to his father while Ivan remains stubbornly defensive. As the truck stops and caf\u00e9s give way to rain-swept, primeval wilderness coastline, Ivan's doubts give way to open defiance. Andrei's powerful need to bond with a father he's never known begins, in turn, to distance him from Ivan. Ivan and his father's test of will escalates into bitter hostility and sudden violence after the trio arrives at their mysterious island destination. Ivan has an outburst of anger after witnessing his father strike Andrei. He shouts at his father, runs into the forest, and climbs to the top of the observatory tower. Andrei and their father run after him. The father tries to reason with Ivan, but this only stresses Ivan further. He then threatens to jump down from the top of the tower. The father tries to reach out to him, but falls to his death. Ivan and Andrei take the body across the forest, bring him on board the boat, and sail back to where they came. While the boys are putting their gear in the car, the boat starts to drift away. Andrei screams, \"Father!\" and starts running towards the shore, followed by Ivan, but it is too late. The boat and the body are sinking. Ivan screams \"Father!\" for the first and the last time from the bottom of his heart. They get into the car and drive away. The film ends with still images from their journey. Now it's plain to see that the two boys have been all alone over there."

Commodore Wesley (Barry Russo) explains that the Enterprise will be a test vessel for the M-5 Multitronic System, a revolutionary tactical and control computer designed by Dr. Richard Daystrom (William Marshall). The M-5 is to handle all ship functions without human assistance. While Science Officer Spock is impressed with M-5, Captain Kirk and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy have doubts. The M-5 succeeds at its first tasks, performing ship functions more quickly and efficiently than a living crew. However, M-5 also exhibits unexpected behavior, such as turning off power and life support to unoccupied parts of the ship, and drawing increased power for unknown reasons; Daystrom maintains M-5 is working properly. In its first tactical drill, M-5 defends the Enterprise against mock attacks from Starships Excalibur and Lexington. The Enterprise is declared the victor, and Wesley jokingly refers to Kirk as \"Captain Dunsel\", employing a Starfleet Academy slang term for a part serving no useful purpose. Kirk is troubled by this. Some time later, M-5 detects the Woden, an unmanned freighter, and attacks with live torpedoes, destroying it. Kirk orders M-5 taken offline, but on attempting to do so, finds it protected by a powerful force field. Chief Engineer Scott orders Ensign Harper to disconnect its power source, but the M-5 creates a direct connection to the ship's warp engines, vaporizing Harper in the process. Spock and Scott attempt a manual override, but discover that the M-5 has rerouted all controls. Spock questions Daystrom on his computer design, and Daystrom reveals that he has imprinted human engrams onto M-5's circuits, creating what amounts to a human mind operating at the speed of a computer. Meanwhile, four of Enterprise'''s sister ships,  Lexington, Potemkin, Excalibur, and Hood, approach to begin a new tactical drill. Since M-5 has disabled communications, Kirk is unable to warn M-5's targets. M-5 detects the ships, and attacks them with full-strength weapons. The crew watches helplessly as the Enterprise fires on the Lexington, killing 53, and then turns to the Excalibur, killing all aboard and leaving her adrift. Commodore Wesley assumes that Kirk himself is responsible for the attacks, and requests permission from Starfleet Command to destroy the Enterprise. Daystrom, having indicated that the engrams he used were his own, believes he can reason with the M-5, but his conversation with the unit quickly degenerates into a self-pitying lament over his own career disappointments. McCoy warns Kirk that he sees a psychotic episode coming, and as Daystrom begins loudly to proclaim his and his creation's invincibility, Spock subdues him with a Vulcan nerve pinch. Kirk then tries to persuade the M-5 to stop its attacks. The M-5 acknowledges Kirk, who asks M-5 what its purpose is. M-5 responds that its purpose is to protect lives. Kirk rejoins that it acted contrary to its purpose by murdering people. M-5 acknowledges that it has committed murder and must therefore die, and shuts itself down. In so doing, it also cripples the Enterprise. Having received permission to destroy Enterprise, the other Federation ships close in. Since Scott is unable to restore communications immediately, Kirk decides to allow the ship to drift with shields down, hoping that Commodore Wesley will realize that the threat has passed. The gamble pays off as the Commodore orders his ships to stand down at the last moment."

The story takes place in 18th-century France, where the Chevalier de Fronsac and Mani of the Iroquois tribe are sent to investigate the mysterious slaughter of hundreds by an unknown creature in the province of G\u00e9vaudan. The plot is loosely based on a real-life series of killings that took place in France in the 18th century and the famous legend of the beast of G\u00e9vaudan; parts of the film were shot at Ch\u00e2teau de Roquetaillade. The film has several extended swashbuckling fight scenes, with martial arts performances by the cast mixed in, making it unusual for a historical drama. The special effects for the creature are a combination of computer generated imagery, as well as puppetry and animatronics designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The film received generally positive critical reviews, highlighting its high production values, cinematography, performances and Gans' atmospheric direction. At a $29 million budget, it was a commercial success, grossing over $70 million in worldwide theatrical release.

Gr\u00e9goire de Fronsac, a knight and the royal naturalist of King Louis XV of France, and his Iroquois companion Mani, arrive to capture the beast. Fronsac becomes interested in Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, was also an avid hunter and a world traveller, whose arm was mangled and rendered useless while overseas. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel. While investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel. A traumatized child witness swears that the beast is controlled by what seems to be a human master. As the investigation proves unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the beast, and Fronsac is sent back in Paris. He realizes that the beast is actually an instrument of a secret society: The Brotherhood of the Wolf, which is working to undermine public confidence in the king and ultimately take over the country. Back in G\u00e9vaudan, the attacks by the real beast continue, and Fronsac returns to put an end to the beast's killings. At a secret rendezvous with Marianne, they are attacked by the beast, where it mysteriously refrains from attacking her. Fronsac, Mani, and a young Marquis set out into the forest and set up an array of traps to capture the beast; it is severely injured but escapes. Mani sets off alone in pursuit, where he finds a catacomb used as the beast's holding pen, inhabited by the Brotherhood. Outnumbered, Mani is shot and killed. Fronsac discovers Mani's body and performs an autopsy, finding a silver bullet\u2014Jean-Fran\u00e7ois' signature choice of ammunition. In a fit of rage, a vengeful Fronsac goes to the catacombs and slaughters many members, but is overpowered by the local authorities and imprisoned. Sylvia visits him in jail and reveals that she is a spy for the Holy See. She explains that Henri Sardis, the local priest and leader of the Brotherhood, believes that he is restoring worship of God to France. Pope Clement XIII has decided that Sardis is insane, and has sent her to eliminate him. She then poisons Fronsac, saying he knows too much. Meanwhile, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois comes to Marianne's room and reveals to her that he is the beast's master; it recognized his scent on her when it came near her, which is why it did not attack. He then rapes her when she rejects his advances. Sylvia's agents exhume Fronsac, who had not been killed but merely put into a temporary coma, and he appears at one of the Brotherhood's sermons. He kills several members, including Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, who reveals that he had regained use of his supposedly mangled arm. Sardis escapes into the mountains, but is mauled to death by a pack of wolves. Fronsac and Marquis go to the beast's lair, where it lies severely wounded. It turns out the beast was a lion that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois brought back from Africa as a cub that was tortured into becoming vicious and trained to wear spiked metal armor. Fronsac takes pity and kills the beast in an act of mercy. Marquis finishes writing his account just before he is led to his execution by a revolutionary mob. He states that he doesn't know what happened to Fronsac and Marianne after the death of the beast; but he hopes that somewhere, they are happy together. A final scene shows Fronsac and Marianne sailing on a ship named Fr\u00e8re Loup\u2014Brother Wolf."

The usage of various cinematographic techniques employed by Christophe Gans, the fight sequences, the atmosphere and particularly the performance of Marc Dacascos as the native-American Mani attracted particularly strong praise. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded it with a 3/4-star rating, writing: \"I would be lying if I did not admit that this is all, in its absurd and overheated way, entertaining.\"  James Berardinelli of ReelViews also rated the movie three stars out of four, saying that it \"has something in it to appeal to just about everyone\" and that it is \"daring in its approach and successful in its result - assuming the result is to provide pure entertainment to the viewer.\" Michael Atkinson of Village Voice wrote \"It's easily the most disarming and inventive movie made for genre geeks in years.\" Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News wrote that this film is \"exciting, alluring and thrilling\", whereas Empire gave the film a three-star rating out of five stating that \"An undeniably handsome creation, but its excessive length and surplus of directorial flourishes merely exacerbate the emptiness of an initially promising plot\". Lisa from Variety gave a positive review mentioning that \"a little Sergio Leone here, a little Sleepy Hollow there and, uh, martial arts-style confrontations are all deftly melded in Brotherhood of the Wolf, an attempt to elucidate the French urban legend of the Beast of Gevaudan.

The blend of various movie genres such as martial arts, mystery, costume drama and horror attracted certain amounts of criticism. In particular, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote \"This new take on horror is more of the bloody same\", whereas Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post said that it is \"a mad agglomeration of styles and traditions that ultimately results in nothing so much as a mad agglomeration of styles and traditions\", ultimately awarding the film a 0.5/4 score."

Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, and each of the three men sees Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as an attractive blonde woman whom he met on a pleasure planet. When Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her. Professor Crater is reluctant to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside.

McCoy conducts a medical exam and, together with Spock, determines that all the salt was drained from Darnell's body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). Kirk tells Professor Crater that he and his wife should stay aboard the Enterprise until they find out what killed Darnell. Crater then runs off trying to find Nancy.

The creature continued to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it, comparing it to the \"now-extinct buffalo\". Kirk informs Enterprise of the creature's intrusion, as the landing party and Crater transport back to the ship. Crater refuses to help them identify the creature, so Kirk orders the fake \"McCoy\" to administer truth serum. Kirk arrives in sickbay to find Crater dead and Spock injured; Spock's Vulcan blood made him incompatible with the creature's needs. Back in its \"Nancy\" form, the creature goes to McCoy's quarters. Kirk arrives with a phaser to provoke the creature into attacking. McCoy gets in the way, giving the creature the opportunity to attack Kirk. The creature reverts to its natural appearance and starts to feed on Kirk. McCoy opens fire with his phaser. The creature changes back into the shape of \"Nancy\" to plead for its life as McCoy continues firing and kills it. As Enterprise leaves orbit, Kirk comments to Spock that he was thinking about the buffalo."

        "title": "The Man Trap_Writing",
        "content": "\"The Man Trap\" appeared in Gene Roddenberry's original pitch for Star Trek as the title of a show with a different plot: the crew face several apparitions that are \"wish-fulfilment traps which become as real as flesh and blood\"; the traps increase in subtlety until the crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality. Lee Erwin, who had previously worked on The Lieutenant with Roddenberry, was commissioned to produce a treatment; an outline featuring a salt-devouring vampire was handed in on April 8, 1966. Meanwhile, George Clayton Johnson had been assigned a storyline, tentatively titled \"Chicago II\", in which the crew of the Enterprise visit a planet where the culture was that of 1920s mob-era Chicago, which later evolved into \"A Piece of the Action\". Johnson was hired after story editor John D. F. Black recommended him to the producers. Johnson decided to use the 1953 science fiction novel The Syndic by Cyril M. Kornbluth as the basis for the story. Roddenberry felt that Johnson's treatment did not match his vision for Star Trek, but did not want to lose him entirely, and asked him to write \"The Man Trap\". Erwin was paid in full for his version, and given a separate \"kill fee\" because it would not be used. Roddenberry wanted to see more action, so the creature's ability to create apparitions was added to the script from the original pitch. Stan Robertson at NBC suggested to Roddenberry that they might wish to get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research, who said that, while it had never happened in reality, a quick death would be likely. Johnson suggested that the creature in \"The Man Trap\" could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of American bison. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing. Erwin was paid a further fee to terminate his contract, and Johnson wrote a first draft teleplay titled \"Damsel With a Dulcimer.\" While writing, Johnson consulted Black, who advised him to place the creature on the Enterprise quickly to increase the pace of the episode. This draft was delivered on May 23, but NBC felt that hallucinations were being overused; the same plot device had appeared in the pilot episode \"The Cage\". Johnson wrote a further draft on May 31, which reduced the number of apparitions, and was well received by Robert H. Justman. Roddenberry and Justman made further tweaks; one was to restore the name \"The Man Trap\" from Erwin's original treatment, another removed a scene which introduced McCoy's apprehension when using the transporter. Johnson further edited the script, but complained about the change in name. After a second edit by Johnson, it was passed from Justman to story editor Black. While the former felt that the script still needed work, Black felt it was nearly ready. Following Black's review, Roddenberry re-wrote the script between June 16 and 21. Johnson felt this re-write had \"downgrad[ed] the story.\" Black later said that Roddenberry removed a large part of Johnson's work, and that Johnson's original work was better than Roddenberry's edited version. Johnson was pleased with the final episode, although he was concerned that viewers might not understand Star Trek after watching \"The Man Trap\" owing to differences in characterization between this episode and the rest of the series. He admitted that he did not like Spock and was concerned that the character would not be understood after this episode. Roddenberry was pleased with Johnson's work, and offered him further writing work on \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\", which had been written by Robert Bloch. Roddenberry only wanted Johnson to \"polish\" the script; Johnson, feeling he was unable to improve it without starting from scratch, turned down the offer, but expressed the desire to work on the show again. He later wrote a story outline titled \"Rock-A-Bye Baby, or Die!\" in which the Enterprise would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes Kirk as its father. This was not commissioned, so \"The Man Trap\" was Johnson's only work on the franchise."

Tormolen removes his environmental suit glove to scratch his nose and comes in contact with a strange red liquid. The landing party is beamed back to the ship and examined by Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy. McCoy finds no medical issues with them and allows them to return to duty. While having lunch, Tormolen begins to act irrationally, expressing hostility towards other crew members, and threatening Lieutenants Sulu and Riley with a knife before turning it on himself. His wound is not life-threatening, but in sick bay he dies after a successful surgery, to McCoy's bewilderment. Both Sulu and Riley also begin to behave irrationally. Sulu runs about with a sword, like a swashbuckler from The Three Musketeers, while Riley revels in his Irish ancestry, locks himself in the engineering section, and proclaims himself captain of the Enterprise. Those whose skin they have touched follow suit, and the infection quickly spreads through the crew. As they abandon their posts, the ship's orbit destabilizes and it falls into the planet's erratic gravity well. As the Enterprise enters the upper atmosphere, the hull begins to heat. Chief Engineer Scott regains control of engineering from Riley, but Riley has shut down the engines. It will be impossible to restart them by normal procedures before the Enterprise crashes into the planet. Spock becomes infected when Nurse Chapel takes his hands and confesses her love for him. Spock struggles to contain his emotions, and infects Captain James T. Kirk when he tries to help. McCoy studies blood samples from his patients and water from Psi 2000 and finds that the water from the planet possesses a previously undetected complex chain of molecules that affects humanoids like alcohol, depressing the centers of judgment and self-control, and is transmitted by touch. He develops a serum to reverse the effects, administering the initial doses to the command crew to allow them to bring the ship back under control. Kirk orders Scott to make a full-power restart of the warp engines, a dangerous process that mixes matter and antimatter in a cold state to create a controlled implosion and drive the ship away from the planet. This is suggested by a theory postulating a relationship between time and antimatter, but it has never before been attempted. The restart is successful, propelling the Enterprise at impossible speed away from the planet into a space-time warp that sends the ship back 71 hours in time. Spock comments that they now know a way to travel back through time. Kirk's response is \"We may risk it someday, Mr. Spock.\""

Geological Technician Fisher is injured after a fall and transported aboard Enterprise, though Chief Engineer Scott has some trouble with the transporter. The transporter equipment appears to be fine but he notices some magnetic dust from ore samples covering Fisher's uniform that may have interfered with the transport. Captain Kirk transports back to the ship. The transporter appears to work correctly, but Kirk experiences some disorientation, and Scott escorts Kirk out of the transporter room. While unsupervised, the transporter activates a second time, materializing a second version of Kirk which behaves more maliciously than his counterpart. This \"evil\" Kirk begins to wander the ship, and those he encounters are confused by his behavior. Scott assists in beaming a dog-like animal specimen from the planet, but two identical creatures materialize (the \"good\" one then the \"evil\" one, like Kirk) \u2013 one completely docile and the other vicious. Scott surmises that the ore dust has caused the transporter to split the personalities of those they beamed up, creating good and evil counterparts. Scott reports this to Mr. Spock and then orders the transporter taken out of service to investigate, stranding the landing party on the planet as the bitterly cold night sets in. Elsewhere on the ship, the \"good\" Kirk begins to feel uncertain, and struggles to make decisions. The \"evil\" Kirk, in a drunken state, sexually assaults Yeoman Janice Rand in her quarters. She scratches his face with her fingernails. When Fisher witnesses this and calls security, the \"evil\" Kirk attacks and knocks him out. Rand reports the incident to the bridge. The \"good\" Kirk orders the crew to capture the \"evil\" Kirk, but at Spock's advice he keeps the fact that their quarry is his evil half a secret so as not to weaken the crew's faith in him; the crew are instead told of an imposter recognizable by the scratches on his cheek. The \"evil\" Kirk hears this announcement and uses makeup to mask his injury. He secures a phaser from a security officer, before going into hiding in engineering. Putting himself in his shoes, the \"good\" Kirk anticipates this move. While the two Kirks scuffle, Spock disables the \"evil\" Kirk with a Vulcan nerve pinch. Spock and McCoy recognize that both Kirks are mentally deteriorating, and they must find a way to reverse the transporter accident to save them, as well as the landing party. Spock and Scott use power from the ship's impulse drive to reverse the transporter on the dog-like specimen. When it materializes, the creature is whole but dead. Spock suggests that it died because its animal brain could not handle the stress of its two halves being reintegrated, so Kirk will be able to survive the same procedure, while Dr. Leonard McCoy insists they can't take the risk that the death was caused by ongoing transporter malfunction. With the landing party nearly dead from hypothermia, the \"good\" Kirk opts to gamble on the procedure rather than wait for an autopsy on the creature. When he releases the \"evil\" Kirk, his other self overpowers him, and gives him facial scratches like his own. Pretending to be the \"good\" Kirk, he tells Rand the truth about the \"imposter\", and makes a date with her before heading to the bridge. He orders the crew to leave orbit, telling the navigator that the landing party cannot be saved. The \"good\" Kirk and McCoy race to the bridge, where the two Kirks face off. The \"good\" Kirk at last persuades the \"evil\" Kirk that they need each other to survive, and will both live on as parts of each other. He orders Scott to attempt the reversal process, and Kirk is rejoined as one being. With his sense of command and good will restored (and the transporter repaired), Kirk orders the landing party beamed up. They are safe despite the cold. Rand tells Kirk about her last encounter with \"evil\" Kirk, but he cuts her off before she can discuss the issue of his romantic overtures."

        "title": "Cat People (1942 film)_Summary",
        "content": "Cat People is a 1942 American horror film directed by Jacques Tourneur and produced for RKO by Val Lewton. The film tells the story of Irena Dubrovna, a newly-married Serbian fashion illustrator obsessed with the idea that she is descended from an ancient tribe of Cat People who metamorphose into panthers when aroused. When her husband begins to show interest in one of his coworkers, Irena begins to stalk her. The film stars Simone Simon as Irena, and features Kent Smith, Tom Conway and Jane Randolph in supporting roles. Production began in 1942, with Lewton being placed in charge of developing RKO's low-budget horror films. He brought together a team of filmmakers that he had worked with in the past, including Tourneur, editor Mark Robson and screenwriter DeWitt Bodeen. Cat People was the first film upon which the team worked. They were given the title by an RKO executive, who instructed them to develop a film from it. After researching various horror films and cat-related literature, Bodeen and Lewton developed the script with Lewton doing extensive uncredited work on the story. The film was shot at RKO's studios reusing sets from previous films such as The Magnificent Ambersons. During editing, Robson developed a technique later called The Lewton Bus, a jump scare that Lewton used in his subsequent films. Cat People had its premiere at the Rialto Theatre in Manhattan on December 5, 1942 before having a wider release on December 25, 1942. Initial critical reviews ranged from negative to mildly enthusiastic. The film did well in the box office, being one of RKO's biggest hits of the season. Several horror films of the 1940s and 1950s were influenced by Cat People, either drawing on the film's shadowy visuals or containing a female character who fears that she possesses a hereditary trait that makes her transform into a monster. The film was followed by a sequel, The Curse of the Cat People, in 1944, and a remake, directed by Paul Schrader, was released in 1982. The film has become well known, though created as a B-movie, being selected by Library of Congress for preservation in the  National Film Registry in 1993. Retrospective reception of the original has been varied. Some modern critics have described the film as being too subdued for the genre and have deprecated the quality of the acting. Others have praised the film's atmosphere and sophistication, with the critic Roger Ebert describing it and the other Val Lewton productions as landmark films of the 1940s."

She catches the attention of marine engineer Oliver Reed (Kent Smith), who strikes up a conversation. Irena invites him to her apartment for tea. At her apartment, Oliver is intrigued by a statue of a medieval warrior on horseback impaling a large cat with his sword. Irena informs Oliver that the figure is King John of Serbia and that the cat represents evil. According to legend, long ago, the Christian residents of her home village gradually turned to witchcraft and devil worship after being enslaved by the Mameluks. When King John drove the Mameluks out and saw what the villagers had become, he had them killed. However, \"the wisest and the most wicked\" escaped into the mountains. Oliver is dismissive of the legend even though Irena clearly takes it seriously. Oliver buys her a kitten, but upon meeting her, it hisses. Irena suggests they go to the pet shop to exchange it. When they enter the shop, the animals go wild in her presence, and Irena becomes uneasy. Irena gradually reveals to Oliver that she believes she is descended from the cat people of her village, and that she will transform into a panther if aroused to passion. Despite this, Oliver asks her to marry him, and she agrees. However, during the dinner after their wedding at The Belgrade, a Serbian restaurant, a cat-like woman walks over and addresses Irena as moya sestra (\"my sister\"). Irena never consummates the marriage, fearful of the consequences. Oliver is patient with her, but eventually persuades her to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway). Judd tries to convince her that her fears stem from childhood traumas.  Meanwhile, Irena is unhappy to discover that Oliver has confided in his assistant, Alice Moore (Jane Randolph). Alice confesses to Oliver that she loves him. When Irena chances to see Oliver and Alice seated together at a restaurant, she follows Alice home. Just as Alice hears a menacing sound, a bus pulls up and she boards it. Soon after, a groundskeeper discovers several freshly killed sheep. The paw prints leading away turn into imprints of a woman's shoes. Irena returns to her apartment looking dishevelled and exhausted; she is shown shortly afterwards weeping in the bathtub. Irena dreams of Dr. Judd dressed up as King John speaking of \"the key\". She later steals the key to the panther's cage in Central Park. Irena, Oliver and Alice visit a museum, and Irena is angered when the two virtually ignore her. That evening, when Alice decides to use the basement swimming pool of her apartment building, she is stalked by an animal. When Alice screams for help, Irena appears, turning on the lights, and says she is looking for Oliver. Alice later finds her bathrobe torn to shreds. After an appointment with Dr. Judd, Irena tells Oliver that she is no longer afraid, but Oliver tells her it is too late: he has realized that he loves Alice and intends to divorce Irena. Later at work, Oliver and Alice are cornered by a snarling animal. Oliver and Alice manage to get out of the building but not before smelling Irena's perfume. Alice calls Judd to warn him to stay away from Irena, but he hangs up when Irena arrives for her appointment with him. He kisses Irena passionately, resulting in her transformation into a panther who attacks and kills him. When Oliver and Alice arrive at Judd's office, Irena slips away and goes to the zoo. There, she opens the panther's cage with the stolen key and is struck down by the escaping panther, which is accidentally run down and killed by a car. Next to the panther's cage, Oliver and Alice find a dead panther lying on the ground. Oliver says, \"She never lied to us.\""

        "content": "In March 1942, producer Val Lewton ended his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick to work for RKO Radio Pictures' Charles Koerner, becoming the head of a new unit created to develop B-movie horror feature films. Writing in 2009, the film critic Kim Newman compared the Lewton productions to RKO's own B-movie mystery series based on The Falcon, which were, unlike Lewton's productions, \"churned out\". The Lewton productions were modestly budgeted compared to Universal's 1941 film The Wolf Man and Paramount's 1944 film The Uninvited, but had larger budgets than those for Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) film The Mad Monster (1942) or Monogram's The Ape Man (1943). Cat People had a budget of around $135,000. This was significantly smaller than Universal had for 1943's Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man but more than the $97,000 that the poverty row studio PRC spent on the 1940 film The Devil Bat. Lewton selected most of the film's main crew, including director Jacques Tourneur and writer DeWitt Bodeen, who all worked on the treatment. These were people Lewton had connections with through their work with Selznick, as Tourneur had worked as part of the second unit teams for Selnick's production of A Tale of Two Cities (1935)  and Bodeen had been a research assistant on what would become Jane Eyre (1943). Tourneur and Bodeen offered conflicting accounts as to how Cat People was conceived. Tourneur said that Lewton called him from RKO to direct the film after Koerner attended a party where it was suggested to him that he develop a film with the title Cat People. Tourneur added that Lewton was not sure what to do with the title and recalled Lewton deciding to not make a \"cheap horror movie that the studio expected but something intelligent and in good taste\". Bodeen's version involved him being hired by Lewton at RKO as a contract writer. He had previously watched British and American horror and suspense films that he felt were \"typical of what we did not want to do\". According to Bodeen, Koerner felt that werewolves, vampires and man-made monsters were over-exploited, and that \"nobody has done much with cats\". Bodeen added that Lewton was unhappy with the proposed title of Cat People and said, \"if you want to get out now, I won't hold it against you\". Bodeen then began researching cat-related literature, including Ambrose Bierce's \"The Eyes of the Panther\" and Margaret Irwin's \"Monsieur Seeks a Wife\". Lewton decided to base the film on Algernon Blackwood's 1906 short story \"Ancient Sorceries\". Blackwood's story had a contemporary setting and involved a Medieval architecture French town inhabited by a group of devil-worshipping cat people. According to Bodeen, as the rights were about to be purchased, Lewton changed his mind at the last minute and told Bodeen that the film would be set in contemporary New York and involve a love triangle between a man, a foreign woman obsessed with abnormal fears, and a female office worker. According to Tourneur, he was not content with the period setting of \"Ancient Sorceries\", stating, \"if you're going to have horror, the audience must be able to identify with the characters in order to be frightened\". Lewton contributed heavily to the screenplay. During the writing process, Tourneur recalled driving by Lewton's home in the evening to find a light turned on where Lewton was still working on the screenplay. Bodeen described the screenplay as a \"group project\", saying Lewton had the original idea and wrote the treatment and screenplay, collaborating with Tourneur and Lewton, and later the film's editor Mark Robson. Bodeen concluded that \"Tourneur was entirely responsible for the style of Cat People, but if you read the screenplay you would find everything in the film was in the original script \u2013 and that's simply because it was a group project. Val, Tourneur, myself, Robson \u2013 we all talked about it and I put it down on paper.\" By May 1, 1942 Bodeen had a fifty-page treatment completed for Cat People."

Leighton's true motivation, however, is his suspicion that Anton Karidian, the leader of a Shakespearean acting troupe currently on the planet, is in fact Kodos the Executioner, former governor of the Earth colony of Tarsus IV. Kodos had ordered that half the population of 8000 be put to death during a food shortage (supply ships were late and it was believed the full population would not survive until they arrived). Both Leighton and Kirk were eyewitnesses. Kirk insists Kodos is dead, but reconsiders after researching Karidian's background. Hoping to meet Karidian at a party at Leighton's home, Kirk meets his daughter Lenore. During a walk outside, the two find Leighton dead. Kirk arranges for the Enterprise to ferry the acting troupe to its next destination. He transfers Lt. Kevin Riley to Engineering, after discovering that he, too, was a witness to the Tarsus IV massacre. These actions arouse the curiosity of First Officer Spock who, after an investigation of his own, learns the history of the massacre, Kirk and Riley's connection to it, and that seven of the nine witnesses to the massacre have died, in each case when Karidian's troupe was somewhere nearby. Riley is poisoned, and a phaser set on overload is left in Kirk's quarters. Kirk confronts Karidian with his suspicions. Karidian does not admit to being Kodos, but argues in defense of Kodos's actions, and when asked to read a transcript of Kodos's execution order, does so with barely a glance at the paper. A computer analysis of his voice results in a near-perfect match with Kodos, but Kirk still hesitates to accuse Karidian. Lt. Riley, recovering in sickbay, overhears Dr. McCoy's log entry and learns that Karidian is suspected of being Kodos. Riley heads for the ship's theater, where the Karidian troupe is performing Hamlet, and goes backstage, phaser in hand, to exact revenge for the death of his family. Kirk discovers him before he can act, and persuades him to surrender the weapon. Karidian, overhearing, is disturbed, and Lenore tries to reassure him by revealing that she has been killing the witnesses to his crimes. Kirk, overhearing this conversation, moves to arrest them both. Lenore snatches a phaser from a security guard and aims at Kirk. Karidian jumps into the line of fire, is hit, and dies. Lenore breaks down and begs her father to wake up and continue his performance.

        "content": "The USS Enterprise, under the command of Captain Kirk, is en route to Markus III to deliver medical supplies destined for the New Paris Colony. The ship passes close to a quasar-like formation identified as Murasaki 312, which Kirk's standing orders require him to study. Kirk sends a science team composed of Science Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, Chief Engineer Scott, Yeoman Mears, and three other specialists (Latimer, Gaetano, and Boma) in the shuttlecraft, Galileo, to investigate the formation. Soon after launch, the shuttle is pulled off course. Spock makes an emergency landing on the planet Taurus II, a rocky, fog-shrouded world in the middle of the Murasaki phenomenon. Crewmembers Latimer and Gaetano scout the area, eventually encountering Taurus II's native inhabitants: giant ape-like creatures armed with enormous spears and shields. Latimer is killed by a spear, and Gaetano drives off the creatures with phaser fire. The crew retreat to the Galileo, only to discover that the creatures seem to be preparing for an organized attack. Despite objections from the others, Spock chooses to attempt to frighten the creatures rather than killing them outright. This proves to be a miscalculation, and Gaetano is killed. Meanwhile, Kirk searches for the shuttle, despite concerns from Commissioner Ferris, who is impatient to start for Markus III. Because of sensor interference, the shuttlecraft Columbus is dispatched to search the planet from orbit, and search parties are transported to the surface. One of the landing parties returns with casualties and reports being attacked by the large, furry creatures. Between boulder-throwing attacks by the primitive giants and quarrels amongst themselves, the crew attempt to make repairs on the shuttle. As most of their conventional fuel has been lost, Mr. Scott adapts the landing party's phasers to power the ship. His repairs are eventually successful, but Boma will not leave without giving Gaetano and Latimer a proper burial. When Spock advises against it, Boma becomes insubordinate, to which Spock responds by allowing him the funeral.  During the ceremony, the creatures attack again, and Spock is pinned by a boulder.  Despite Spock's orders to leave him, McCoy and Boma free him.  Spock then manages to get the Galileo off the ground by using the shuttle's boosters. As a result, the shuttle now has too little fuel to escape the planet's gravity or even to achieve a stable orbit, and there is still no way to contact the Enterprise. Spock suddenly decides to dump and ignite all the remaining fuel from the shuttle's engines. The giant flare he produces is seen on the Enterprise view screen just as the ship has left orbit. Kirk reverses course, and the survivors are beamed out just as the shuttle is destroyed on re-entry. Back on board the Enterprise, Kirk questions Spock, trying to get him to admit that his final action was motivated more by emotion than logic. Spock refuses but freely admits to stubbornness, at which the rest of the crew burst into laughter."

Their stagnant life is disrupted by an early morning phone call from Chris's childhood friend Toni (Lee Ross), who has returned to England after several years of travelling through Africa, Europe, and the United States as a bohemian poet. Years before, the two shared a dream of escaping boring suburban existence to live in avant-garde splendor in Paris. Toni's return sparks memories in Chris about their wild days in Paris in the late 1960s. Disillusioned about the lifestyle he's chosen\u2014having abandoned his youthful passion for photography for a steady job as a London banker\u2014Chris takes long walks at night, making lists in his head of things for which he should feel grateful. Feeling that something is missing in his life, Chris sees in Toni the person he could have become\u2014a free spirit living a vagabond's existence without worries or responsibilities. Toni outspokenly criticises Chris for his acceptance of a middle class lifestyle, a mortgage, and a nine-to-five job. One night, Chris goes to a punk rock club with Toni who gets him stoned on cannabis. Envious of his friend's lifestyle, Chris begs Toni to reveal his secret for happiness, and Toni responds that it's doing what you want, not what others want. With his dull and tranquil marriage, Chris increasingly obsesses on the past. He rediscovers naked pictures of his former French girlfriend, Annick (Elsa Zylberstein), and in the coming days he thinks back to 1968 when they were in Paris together. He remembers taking on the persona of a French beatnik with a hatred for all things English. His French fantasy was interrupted when he met Marion, who was holidaying in Paris with some friends. Taken aback by this educated and strait-laced Englishwoman, Chris began spending time with her, telling her about Annick and his conflicting feelings towards England. Unimpressed with his unrealistic dreams, Marion informed him that eventually he would get married because he was \"not original enough\" to avoid marriage and a conventional future. When Annick learned about his friendship with the Englishwoman, she broke off their relationship. Back in the present, Chris is unable to get over the feeling that he has surrendered his youth and ideals to a life he once swore he would never lead. One night he attends a party at Toni's girlfriend's house, arriving without his wife. There he hears Toni casually mentioning that his girlfriend just had an abortion, and then sees him flirting with another woman at the party\u2014doing what he wants to do. Later, Chris meets a beautiful woman, Joanna (Amanda Ryan), who invites him to sleep with her. After learning that Toni in fact asked her to sleep with his friend as a way of ruining his marriage, Chris rejects the offer and returns home to Marion. The next day, Chris comes home from work and finds Toni in the house with Marion. Toni hints that he and Marion had sex, and the two friends get into a fight in the garden. Later, Marion tells him that Toni made a pass at her, but that she rejected him. She tells him that despite all of his talk, Toni is really only jealous of Chris and the life he leads. The next day, Toni shows up at Chris' house to say goodbye before headed to Malibu, where he intends to do some screenwriting. He tries to tempt Chris into leaving his life behind and come with him, but Chris refuses, admitting, \"I like my life; I'm content.\" That night, while Chris is on one of his walks, Marion approaches and asks what he would put on the list for \"happy\". Chris responds, \"Happy\u2014if not now, never.\""

Enterprise ends up in Earth's upper atmosphere, and is picked up as a UFO on military radar. A U.S. Air Force F-104 interceptor piloted by Captain John Christopher (Roger Perry), is scrambled to identify the craft. Fearing an attack, Captain Kirk orders a tractor beam to be used on the jet, which tears the plane apart. The pilot is transported aboard the Enterprise. Fearing Christopher could disrupt the timeline if returned to Earth, Kirk at first decides that the pilot must stay with the Enterprise. When Science Officer Spock later discovers that the pilot's as-yet-unborn son will play an important role in a future mission to Saturn, Kirk realizes he must return Christopher to Earth after all. After learning of the existence of film taken of the Enterprise by Christopher's wing cameras, Kirk and Lt. Sulu beam down to the airbase to recover the film and any other evidence of their visit. They are caught by an Air Policeman, who accidentally activates an emergency signal on Kirk's communicator and is immediately beamed aboard. Kirk and Sulu continue their search, after which Kirk is captured again and Sulu escapes. Spock, Sulu, and Christopher, who knows the base's layout, beam down to recover Kirk. After Kirk's guards are subdued, Christopher grabs one of their guns and demands to be left behind. Spock, having anticipated Christopher would make such an attempt, appears behind Christopher and disables him with a Vulcan nerve pinch. After they return to the ship, Spock and Chief Engineer Scott inform Kirk of a possible escape method by slingshotting around the Sun to break away and return to their time. The maneuver is risky, since even a small miscalculation could destroy the ship, or make them miss their own era. Kirk okays the maneuver, and time on board the Enterprise moves backwards. Christopher is beamed back to his fighter jet at the instant he first encountered the Enterprise, preventing any evidence of the ship being produced, and erasing his memory of his time on the Enterprise. The same is done with the Air Policeman. Enterprise then successfully returns to the 23rd century."

They find the inhabitants living in a 19th-century Earth-style culture, ruled over by cloaked and cowled \"Lawgivers\" and a reclusive dictator, Landru. Their arrival is shortly followed by the \"Festival\", a period of violence, destruction, and sexual aggression. Kirk's landing party seeks shelter from the mob at a boarding house owned by Reger. A friend of Reger's suspects that the visitors are \"not of the Body\" (the whole of Betan society), and summons Lawgivers. When the landing party refuses to come with the Lawgivers, the Lawgivers become immobile. Reger leads the Enterprise landing team to a hiding place. En route, a telepathic command causes the townspeople to attack the landing party. They stun the attackers with their phasers, and find Lt. O'Neill, the other member of the original landing party, among them. They take O'Neill with them, but keep him sedated at Reger's advice. Reger reveals that Landru \"pulled the Archons down from the skies\". Contacting the ship, Kirk learns that heat beams from the planet are attacking the Enterprise, which must use all its power for its shields. Its orbit is deteriorating and it will crash in 12 hours unless the beams are turned off. A projection of Landru appears in the hiding place, and Kirk and his team are rendered unconscious by ultrasonic waves. The landing party is imprisoned in a dungeon. Dr. Leonard McCoy is \"absorbed into the Body\", i.e., placed under Landru's mental control, but Marplon, a member of the underground against Landru, rescues Kirk and Spock. Reger and Marplon tell how Landru saved their society from war and anarchy 6,000 years ago and reduced the planet's technology to a simpler level. Overhearing their whispered plans, McCoy summons the Lawgivers. Kirk and Spock subdue them and don their robes. Marplon takes Kirk and Spock to the Hall of Audiences, where priests commune with Landru. A projection of Landru appears and threatens them. Kirk and Spock use their phasers to blast through the wall and expose a computer programmed by Landru, who died 6,000 years ago. The computer neutralizes their phasers. Kirk and Spock argue that because the computer has destroyed the creativity of the people by disallowing their free will, it is evil and should self-destruct, freeing the people of Beta III. The computer complies. The heat beams stop, and the Enterprise is saved. Kirk agrees to leave Federation advisors and educators on the planet to help reform the civilization."

He later appeared as Jaris, ruler of Argelius II, in the second-season episode \"Wolf in the Fold\". This was actor Jon Lormer's second appearance on Star Trek. He had previously appeared as Dr. Theodore Haskins in the episode \"The Menagerie\" and would make a third appearance as an unnamed old man in the third-season episode \"For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky\". David L. Ross made his third appearance on Star Trek in this episode, after having appeared as a security guard in the episodes \"Miri\" and as a transporter chief in \"The Galileo Seven\" earlier in the first season. He received his first speaking role as Lieutenant Johnson in the second season episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", and appeared in another speaking role as Lt. Galloway in the second season episode \"The Omega Glory\". Character actor Sid Haig has an uncredited role as one of the hooded Lawgivers who first confront the landing party in Reger's boarding house. \"The Return of the Archons\" introduces for the first time the Federation's Prime Directive. However, an important modification is made to the absolutist non-interference rule almost immediately. Kirk argues that the Prime Directive does not bar interference with other cultures, but rather bars interference only with a \"living and growing\" culture. Scholar Eric Greene argues this is reflective of the \"frontier myth\" of Star Trek and American foreign policy in the late 20th century, in which a superior culture expands to impose its understanding of freedom and progress on others. M. Keith Booker, interpreting the politics of Star Trek, agrees, noting that in leaving behind a sociological team to \"help restore the planet's culture to a more human form\" means restoring it to one that \"suits the values of the Federation and twenty-third century Earth.\" Indeed, the Prime Directive would only truly be honored during the series in the episode \"Bread and Circuses\". Location shooting for \"Return of the Archons\" occurred on the 40 Acres backlot in Culver City, California. The street scenes were part of the \"Town of Atlanta\", a set which consists of a mid-1800s city street, a town square, and a residential area (originally constructed for the motion picture Gone with the Wind in 1939). The dungeon set was first constructed for this episode, and reused in the first-season episode \"Errand of Mercy\" and the second-season episode \"Catspaw\". Marplon's absorption booth console was also reused several times in the series. It reappeared (with modifications) as a relay station in the second-season episode \"I, Mudd\", as a Federation outpost control panel in the third-season episode \"The Lights of Zetar\", the housing for the Romulan cloaking device  in the third-season episode \"The Enterprise Incident\", and as the force field control station at the penal colony Elba II in the third-season episode \"Whom Gods Destroy\". The computer that ruled Beta III would be seen again (slightly modified) in the first-season episode \"A Taste of Armageddon\". The doors to the Hall of Audiences were a reuse of doors previously seen in the episode \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" and would be reused in \"A Taste of Armageddon\". The episode contains two errors. When the \"Festival\" breaks out, the mob begins hurling stones at the landing party. A large \"rock\" made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 accidentally hits one of the Enterprise security personnel in the head. The actor stayed in character and kept running to ensure that the take was not ruined. When the landing party rests in a bedroom at Reger's boarding house, the windows are blacked out in all wide shots, but clearly transparent and showing the street outside in all close-ups."

She is suspicious of Barrett and asks Tony to dismiss him, but he refuses. To bring his lover, Vera, into his world, Barrett convinces Tony that the house also needs a maid. When Tony finally agrees, Barrett hires Vera on the pretext that she is his sister. Barrett encourages Vera to seduce Tony. Later, when Tony and Susan return early from a vacation, they find Barrett and Vera sleeping together. Believing that the two are siblings, he flies into a rage at Barrett, who then reveals that they are not related and she is his fianc\u00e9e. He and Vera then make it clear that Tony was sleeping with her, to Susan's dismay. After Tony dismisses them, Susan departs silently. At this point, Tony has become reliant on Barrett and Vera. He becomes a drunkard, which is exacerbated by Susan's refusal to answer his calls. Eventually, Tony encounters Barrett in a pub, who spins a tale about Vera having made fools of them both. He begs Tony to re-engage him as his manservant, and he agrees. Gradually the two reverse roles, with Barrett taking more control and Tony retreating into infantilism. Barrett also insinuates Vera back into the house. Susan arrives and attempts to convince Tony to come back to her. She finds him totally dependent on Barrett who keeps him supplied with alcohol and prostitutes. She walks through the sordid scene, and suddenly kisses Barrett, who forcefully returns her attentions. As he grows more brutal, Susan struggles to free herself from his embrace, and Tony, rising from his drunken stupor, attempts to intervene. However, he trips and falls onto the floor, causing all the prostitutes to laugh at him. Tony then has an outburst and Barrett orders everyone to leave. Before departing, Susan slaps Barrett with the jeweled collar of her coat. Barrett is shocked, but quickly recovers and places her coat on her shoulder as she leaves.

        "content": "The movie was directed by Joseph Losey, an American director who spent the last part of his career and life in England, after being blacklisted by Hollywood in the 1950s. His health was poor during production, causing Bogarde to provide significant assistance with the direction and finishing the film. The film is based on The Servant, a 1948 Robin Maugham novella. The screenplay, written by Harold Pinter, stripped the plot to a more economical and chilling storyline. Pinter also appeared in the film, as a restaurant patron in one scene with a speaking part. Writing for the British Film Institute, film critic Nick James noted: \"It was Losey who first showed Robin Maugham's novella The Servant to Bogarde in 1954. Originally separately commissioned by director Michael Anderson, Pinter stripped it of its first-person narrator, its yellow book snobbery, and the arguably anti-Semitic characterisation of Barrett \u2013 oiliness, heavy lids \u2013 replacing them with an economical language that implied rather than stated the slippage of power relations away from Tony towards Barrett.\" Losey's other collaborations with Pinter, Accident and The Go-Between, share a resemblance to The Servant in that these offer the same savage indictment of the waning English class system, a theme which had been rarely addressed in British cinema. The movie was re-released in an updated production in 2013, to mark its 50th anniversary."

Ryan wants to go to the wild too to learn how to roar like his father, but Samson disapproves of the idea. When the zoo closes, all the animals are free to roam. Samson and his friends, Benny the squirrel, Bridget the giraffe whom Benny has a crush on, Larry the dim-witted anaconda, and Nigel the unlucky but popular koala compete in a turtle curling championship. Ryan and his own friends accidentally causes a stampede which heads to the game and endangers the animals. Samson and Ryan have a falling-out and Ryan runs off before Samson can apologize. He later sneaks into a green Intermodal container which is rumored to be heading to the wild. Just as he regrets his decision, Ryan suddenly gets locked inside the container, which is then loaded onto a freight truck, shipping him away. With the help of a pigeon, Hamir, Samson and his friends go after Ryan, hiding in a garbage disposal truck, but Benny falls overboard. After passing through Times Square and nearly being crushed in the truck, the group encounters a pack of rabid stray dogs. Samson escapes through the sewer rather than fighting as his friends expect for him to do. There, they take directions to the docks from two streetwise alligator brothers, Stan and Carmine. The next morning, they steal a tugboat during a hectic escape from the harbor. After reuniting with Benny, who has followed them with a flock of Canada geese, Samson manages to drive the boat with Larry's help and the geese lead them to the right directions toward Ryan's ship. A few days later the boat runs aground in Africa, where all the animals in the area are being evacuated by the carriers, as a nearby volcano is about to erupt. They witness Ryan run into the jungle, but Samson is unable to find him. After failing to eat a crude hyrax, his friends questions if he has ever been in the wild before, to which he forlornly confirms. The rest of the group heads back to the ship, but Samson continues to search for his son. While walking, he sees plants and rocks changing colors, which he attributes as his instincts working. Nigel is abducted by a herd of wildebeests who reside in the volcano and their leader Kazar, pronounces him \"The Great Him,\" based on an \"omen\" he received when he was young: about to be devoured by lions, a toy koala fell from a plane and scared the lions away, saving his life. This experience made Kazar to believe that \"The Great Him\" will help him and his kind create a change in the food chain that will allow prey to become predator and vice versa. In order to that, he thinks the wildebeests have to eat a lion. Bridget and Larry are also get captured and planned to be eaten as well. Ryan hides up an old tree, but a gang of vultures attack him under Kazar's orders. The branch breaks and traps his paw. Samson hears Ryan's cries and runs to save him, scaring off the vultures. The two reunite but are interrupted by the wildebeests. Ryan is shocked when Samson tells him to run. They retreat to a tree where Samson reveals the truth about his past: he was born in a circus and was unable to roar just like Ryan. Samson's rude, selfish, derivative, hateful and possibly abusive father disowned him and allowed him to be sent to the zoo, where he lied about his origins to avoid humiliation. The wildebeests discover them and push the tree over the cliff, with Samson still hanging on. Ryan is captured and taken to the volcano. After a run-in with a group of female German dung beetles, Benny finds Samson and gives him the confidence to be himself, even if he is not from the wild. They soon find out that Samson's \"instincts\" were actually two chameleons named Cloak and Camo, who have been leading Samson to the volcano, so he would help them defeat Kazar's army. Samson uses the chameleons' camouflage abilities to sneak into the volcano, but when his disguise blows off due to the intense heat of the mountain, Kazar orders his army to attack. Seeing Samson in danger, Ryan climbs onto a catapulting device and launches himself at Kazar, finally letting out a roar. With Kazar distracted, Samson easily overpowers him. Ryan tells Samson that he is happy to have him as a father. The other wildebeests are touched by this and refuse to serve Kazar any further. Samson then gains the courage and roars powerfully enough to push back a charging Kazar. The group and the wildebeests flee, except for Kazar, who is trapped in the erupting volcano, in which he gets crushed to death by a falling rock. They manage to escape on the boat and travel back to New York."

Galt, Master Thrall of Triskelion, informs them that they will be trained in games to entertain his masters, the Providers. Each is fitted with a \"collar of obedience\" that engages when they disobey Galt's orders. Uhura, Chekov, and Kirk are assigned individual \"drill thralls\": Lars, Tamoon, and Shahna, respectively. After a period of training, the Providers bid for the new thralls in their currency, \"quatloos\". While running among ancient ruins outside the arena, Kirk tries gaining information about the Providers from Shahna, but her collar is activated when she speaks too freely. Kirk protests that he should have been the one punished, and when they are returned to their cells, Shahna expresses her appreciation for this. When she moves to embrace him, Kirk knocks her unconscious, and uses her key to free himself, Uhura, and Chekov, but they are stopped by Galt. The Enterprise follows the ion trail, finding a planet with a humanoid settlement. As Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy prepare to beam down, the voice of Provider One warns them not to transport. Kirk's voice is also heard, and he brings them up to date. Kirk challenges the Providers to show themselves and finds himself in an underground chamber; The Providers are three disembodied brains. Kirk offers them a wager: he and his two officers will fight an equal number of thralls. If Kirk and his party win, the Providers will teach the thralls to govern themselves. If they lose, the Enterprise crew will become thralls. The Providers agree, stipulating that Kirk must battle three thralls alone. As the Enterprise crew watches from the ship, Kirk kills two thralls and injures a third. Galt sends in Shahna. Kirk subdues her, and she surrenders. The Providers declare that Kirk has won the wager and unlock the thralls' collars. Shahna expresses a desire to follow Kirk to the stars, but he answers that she and the other thralls must first learn to live in their newfound freedom."

        "content": "The Federation starship USS Enterprise receives a garbled message from Starfleet mentioning the USS Intrepid, a Federation starship crewed entirely by Vulcans. First Officer Spock suddenly looks shocked and announces that he has felt the Intrepid \"die\". Starfleet then succeeds in making contact, and orders Captain Kirk to investigate the Gamma 7A system, the last known position of the Intrepid. Ensign Chekov reports that the sensors show no life readings in the system of a billion inhabitants. Meanwhile, Spock is examined by Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy in sickbay, where he explains he felt the combined shock and terror in the minds of 400 of his fellow Vulcans aboard the Intrepid as they died. McCoy is amazed that Spock felt anything over the distance involved, but admits there is a lot about Vulcans he still doesn't understand. Spock returns to the bridge just as Lt. Uhura announces she has lost contact with Starfleet. Kirk has Spock scan a dark zone that appears on the main view screen. Suddenly, half the crew are sickened or faint. Spock is unable to determine the nature of the zone, but suggests it is some kind of energy turbulence, and possibly responsible for the death of the system inhabitants and the Intrepid crew. Kirk has Chekov launch a sensor probe into the void. The probe transmits a piercing, high-pitched noise before contact with it is lost. Kirk orders the ship into the zone, and as it enters, the piercing sound returns and all the stars disappear from the main view screen. Dr. McCoy then reports that the crew are getting worse, and Chief Engineer Scott reports a loss of power. Spock surmises that the ship has entered a sort of negative energy field that interferes with biological and mechanical processes. The Enterprise appears to be accelerating of its own accord, and the ship's engines seem to be operating in reverse: forward thrust slows the ship down. Kirk suggests that all available power be channeled into a massive forward thrust, in the hope of breaking free of the zone, but the effort succeeds only in bringing the ship to a halt. Their quarry is finally revealed to be a gigantic, multicolored object resembling an amoeba. Kirk launches a sensor probe into it, which reveals that the object is indeed made of protoplasm, and is alive. McCoy believes that a crewed probe must be sent into the creature to gather the data needed to destroy it, and volunteers himself for the job. Spock insists that he is better qualified.  Kirk is reluctant to send either of them arguing that it would be a suicide mission and that if anyone should go it should be him as the captain.  But Spock points out that Kirk is not a science specialist and is much better served commanding the Enterprise.  Kirk is then forced to choose which of his two friends to send out in the shuttle, with a realistic probability they won't return.  Kirk ultimately chooses Spock, agreeing that he is better equipped to handle the mission. Spock pilots a shuttle through the creature's outer membrane and makes his way toward the nucleus. Eventually, he reports that the creature is ready to reproduce, and suggests a method of destroying it, but the key part of the message is lost. Kirk and McCoy meet to discuss the situation, and Kirk speculates that if the organism is like an invading virus, then an equivalent of \"antibodies\" is needed to destroy it. Kirk takes the Enterprise into the creature's body, and orders Chief Engineer Scott to prepare an antimatter bomb with a timer set for a seven-minute delay. The bomb is fired into the cell's nucleus and the Enterprise backs out using what little power remains. With seconds remaining, Spock's shuttle is finally located and Kirk orders Scott to tow it with a tractor beam. With power levels nearly exhausted, the ship approaches the outer membrane just as the bomb explodes. Both the Enterprise and the shuttle are thrown clear of the organism as it is destroyed. The Enterprise is restored to full power and sustains only minor damage."

        "content": "Samuel Goldwyn paid $150,000 for the screen rights to the Edna Ferber novel, who sold it to him confident he understood she had intended it to be \"primarily a story of the rape of America . . . by the wholesale robber barons of that day.\" Goldwyn was attracted to the melodramatic Barbary Coast-like aspects of the story, which prompted him to hire that film's director, Howard Hawks, to bring Come and Get It to the screen. He also was intrigued by the fact Hawks' grandfather had served as the basis for the character of Barney Glasgow. Ferber had approved Jane Murfin's script, which Hawks found wanting, and he persuaded her and Goldwyn to allow him to bring in Jules Furthman to work on a rewrite. Goldwyn announced Miriam Hopkins would play the dual roles of Lotta Morgan and Lotta Bostrom, but Hawks was not happy with his choice. He looked at numerous screen tests of aspiring starlets and finally settled on Andrea Leeds, who previously had played minor or uncredited roles in a handful of films. Eventually he replaced her with the even less experienced Frances Farmer and cast Leeds in the supporting role of Ewie Glasgow, Richard's younger sister, instead. Goldwyn tried to borrow Spencer Tracy from MGM for the lead role of Barney Glasgow, but Louis B. Mayer refused to let him work for his chief rival, so contract player Edward Arnold was assigned the role. Soon after filming began, Goldwyn underwent two major surgeries that incapacitated him for a lengthy period of time, keeping him away from the studio and the daily rushes. Hawks took advantage of the situation and allowed Furthman to change completely the tone of Ferber's original story; cast slender Walter Brennan as Swan Bostrom, a man Ferber had described as \"the strongest man in the North woods;\" and arrange a shooting schedule and budget Goldwyn never would have approved. Upon returning to the studio, Goldwyn viewed a rough cut of the film and was shocked to discover Hawks had shifted the focus from the unbridled destruction of the land to a love triangle in which brawling Barney Glasgow and Swan Bostrom vied for the affections of lusty Lotta Morgan. The character of Richard Glasgow, intended to be the second lead, barely was in the film, which was cluttered with Hawks-like improvised bits of business. When the director refused to comply with Goldwyn's demands for major changes, the producer fired Hawks from the project. William Wyler had begun post-production work on Dodsworth when he was summoned to Goldwyn's home and told he would be completing Come and Get It. Wyler was loath to take over a film started by someone else, but Goldwyn threatened him with suspension if he refused to accept the assignment. He did so reluctantly, and in later years he recalled, \"I was talked into doing it, and I've been sorry about that ever since. The picture wasn't very good.\" Wyler spent two weeks filming what amounted to about the final third of the completed film. He strongly objected to Goldwyn's desire to give him sole directing credit, and preferred his name not be attached to the film at all. He finally relented but only when Goldwyn agreed to give Hawks top billing. Wyler never considered Come and Get It a part of his filmography and disowned it whenever he could, although it greatly pleased Ferber, who praised Goldwyn \"for the courage, sagacity, and power of decision\" he demonstrated by \"throwing out the finished Hawks picture and undertaking the gigantic task of making what amounted to a new picture.\" Exterior scenes were filmed along the North Fork Clearwater River in Idaho. The soundtrack includes \"Aura Lea\" by George R. Poulton and W. W. Fosdick and \"The Bird on Nellie's Hat\" by Alfred Solman and Arthur J. Lamb."

Their staff, composed of 110 inkers, painters, and animators, were also let go. MGM found it more profitable to continually re-release older cartoons than produce new ones. Hanna and Barbera remained a partnership and invested $30,000 out of pocket into a new venture, H-B Enterprises. The duo began work on storyboards featuring new characters, the first among them Ruff, a cat, and Reddy, a dog. Hanna later equated their respective names with he and his partners' dispositions at the period in which they were created. They forged a deal with former MGM colleague George Sidney in which he received a small percentage of the new company in return for acting as a business representative. Sidney arranged for a meeting at Screen Gems, who had at the time been considering re-entering the animation business. Feeling confidence in the Ruff and Reddy characters, the duo presented their proposal, along with a streamlined production budget employing limited animation."

        "content": "Ruff and Reddy, as one of the first original animated series produced for television, pioneered the technique of limited animation. Limited animation would require far fewer drawings, and, by extension, less inking and painting. This method was employed by necessity, as higher budgets had been the cause for the collapse of the theatrical cartoon business. Hanna, in a six-page memo, had attempted to convince his superiors at MGM to employ economized techniques in order to reduce the cost of their short films, but received no response. At that time, he had estimated a six-minute cartoon to cost $17,500 if it employed the limited animation technique (down from the $35,000 budget the duo received at MGM). When pitching to Screen Gems, Hanna had worked down the numbers to a much smaller $3,000, and the duo were very confident the company would respond with great excitement. Screen Gems appreciated the show concept, but explained to the duo that the budget for television, still an experimental medium, would be very stringent. Eventually, the company gave the partnership an option to produce five five-minute segments, with an escalating budget starting from $2,700. Hanna described the process in his 1996 memoir, A Cast of Friends: \"It was essential that we select only the key poses necessary to convincingly impart the illusion of movement in our cartoons.\" This method often emphasizes close-ups, rather than full or medium shots. All in all, the production process for Ruff and Reddy was not dissimilar from the process used to create theatrical cartoons: a script was written, followed by a storyboard illustrating key poses. Afterwards, a recorded soundtrack with dialogue was used to create a \"pose reel,\" which would give the filmmakers a sense of timing. Watching pose reels during their MGM years had emphasized that simple key poses would be enough to demonstrate humor. Hanna believed the process in line with the nature of television during the period, stressing \"intimacy rather than spectacle,\" represented an entirely different viewing experience (a large movie screen versus a small, standard-dimension television screen). In addition to the quicker, cheaper production process, Hanna and Barbera made the decision to produce the segments in full color. \"It was one of the smartest things we did,\" Hanna said. \"We said, 'Color will be here soon. Cartoons last forever. Let's go ahead and do them in color, and we'll be a jump ahead of the game.'\" This strategy paid off in 1954, when color television was (introduced in 1957, but just beginning to achieve some commercial success between 1957 & 1960, source citation http://www.earlytelevision.org) beginning to yield some commercial success. Ruff and Reddy also eschewed lavish, detailed background art for simple, colorful illustrations."

The brothers then agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a kagemusha, a political decoy. Later, the Takeda army has besieged a castle of Tokugawa Ieyasu. One evening when Shingen visits the battlefield he is shot by a sniper who has mapped Shingen's previous movements in the camp. Mortally wounded, he orders a withdrawal and commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years. Shingen soon dies with only a small group of witnesses. Meanwhile, Shingen's rivals Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Uesugi Kenshin each contemplate the consequences of Shingen's withdrawal of his army still not knowing of his death. Nobukado presents the thief to Shingen's generals, proposing to have this kagemusha impersonate Shingen full-time. At first, even the thief is unaware of Shingen's death, until he tries to break into a huge jar, believing it to contain treasure, and instead finds Shingen's preserved corpse. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and set him free. Later, the Takeda leaders secretly drop the jar with the corpse inside into Lake Suwa. Spies working for Tokugawa and his ally Oda witness the disposal of the jar and, suspecting that Shingen has died, go to report the death. The thief, however, overhearing the spies, goes to offer his services, hoping to be of some use to Shingen in death. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were making an offering of sake to the god of the lake. The spies follow the Takeda army as they march home from the siege. Although they suspect that Shingen has died, they are later convinced by the impostor's performance. Returning home, the kagemusha successfully fools Shingen's retinue. By imitating the late warlord's gestures and learning more about him, the kagemusha begins to uncannily mimic the persona of Shingen, and even convinces Takeda Katsuyori's son and Shingen's grandson, who was very close with Shingen. When the kagemusha must preside over a clan council to plan how to respond to provocative attacks made by Tokugawa against Takeda border castles, he is instructed by Nobukado to not speak until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the kagemusha will simply agree with the generals' plan and dismiss the council. However, Katsuyori is incensed by his father's decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the kagemusha in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingen's death. He directly asks the kagemusha what course of action the \"lord thinks\" should be taken. After a long pause, the kagemusha replies, \"A mountain does not move,\" convincingly in Shingen's own manner, which further impresses the generals. Soon, in 1573, Oda Nobunaga is mobilizing his forces to attack Azai Nagamasa, continuing his campaign in central Honshu to maintain his control of Kyoto against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda clans launch an attack on Takeda territory, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of other generals. The kagemusha is forced to lead reinforcements to the 1574 Battle of Takatenjin, and helps inspire the troops to victory. In a fit of overconfidence, the kagemusha attempts to ride Shingen's spirited horse. When he falls off, those who rush to help him see that he does not have their lord's battle scars, and he is revealed as an impostor. The thief is driven out of the palace in disgrace, and Katsuyori takes over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa clans are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland. Now in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads the counter-offensive against Nobunaga, resulting in the Battle of Nagashino. Although courageous in their assault, wave after wave of attacking Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of gunfire from Oda arquebusiers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The exiled kagemusha, who has followed the Takeda army, is dismayed and in a final show of loyalty, he takes up a spear and makes a hopeless charge against the Oda lines. Mortally wounded, the kagemusha attempts futilely to retrieve the f\u016brinkazan banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds in the water. His body floats past it as the film concludes with a long shot of the abandoned banner."

This is because they persuaded 20th Century Fox to make up a shortfall in the film's budget when the original producers, Toho Studios, could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century Fox received the international distribution rights to the film. Kurosawa originally cast the actor Shintaro Katsu in the title role. Katsu left the production, however, before the first day of shooting was over; in an interview for the Criterion Collection DVD, executive producer Coppola states that Katsu angered Kurosawa by arriving with his own camera crew to record Kurosawa's filmmaking methods. It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa's previous films. Nakadai played both the kagemusha and the lord whom he impersonated. Kurosawa wrote a part in Kagemusha for his longtime regular actor Takashi Shimura, and Kagemusha was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared. However, the scene in which he plays a servant who accompanies a western doctor to a meeting with Shingen was cut from the foreign release of the film. The Criterion Collection DVD release of the film restored this scene as well as approximately another eighteen minutes in the film. According to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release.

A Flemish Christian knight named Charles Le Vaillant (Jean-Claude Van Damme) becomes demoralized by the horrors of war and decides to create a new religious order. This new order brings together members from the three main religions of the region: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. As a self-declared leader and messiah, Charles writes the sacred texts of the Order. While traveling to Syria, his camp is attacked by the Christian knights, who kill Le Vaillant. The last chapter from their religious text, buried by Le Vaillant in a secret place, becomes lost in the desert after the attack. In the modern day, Rudy Cafmeyer (Jean-Claude van Damme), a thief and smuggler of valuable historical artifacts, breaks into a high-security building and steals a precious Faberg\u00e9 egg. He triggers an alarm in the process and is forced to fight his way out of the building, finding no car to meet him because the getaway driver, Yuri, was forced to leave by police. His problems are compounded when a potential buyer attempts to steal the egg and falls on it, destroying it. It is revealed that Rudy's father is archaeologist and museum curator Oscar \"Ozzie\" Cafmeyer (Vernon Dobtcheff). Ozzie travels to Israel in search of a secret he has discovered and is kidnapped while on the phone with Rudy, who travels to Jerusalem to rescue him. Ozzie's associate, Professor Walt Finley (Charlton Heston), gives Rudy the key to a safe-deposit box in East Jerusalem before being gunned down by unknown assailants. Rudy opens the safe-deposit box and finds an ancient map showing a series of tunnels and a treasure room beneath Jerusalem. Meanwhile, a devout contingent of Le Vaillant's followers known as the Order continues to practice his peaceful teachings in Israel. One of the disciples, Cyrus (Brian Thompson), enters into conflict with the Order's leader Pierre Gaudet over Cyrus's inflammatory rhetoric regarding an imminent holy war. Cyrus has Pierre Gaudet killed using a car bomb and assumes control of the Order. Israeli Police Chief Ben Ner (Ben Cross) views Rudy's arrival with hostility and takes steps to have Rudy deported, appointing Lt. Dalia Barr (Sofia Milos) to ensure that Rudy does not escape. Lt. Barr escorts Rudy to the airplane but Ben Ner calls and demands their return, claiming that Rudy is smuggling an artifact. Lt. Barr knows that Rudy has been searched and is not in possession of any artifacts so she unlocks Rudy's handcuffs and lets him escape in a feigned struggle, meeting up with him again after he escapes from the airport in a stolen ramp-towing vehicle. Lt. Barr reveals that she was once a disciple of the Order but that she left when she was 18. Together they visit Yuri, who translates the map and explains that it leads to treasure, but thieves break in and steal the map, shooting and killing Yuri in the process. Rudy steals a motorcycle and pursues the thief who has the map. He catches up with him and shoots him, causing the thief to drop the map, but is also shot and injured. Rudy hides from the police and is found by Lt. Barr, who drives him to be helped back to health by her old friend Avram, who is still a member of the Order. Lt. Barr gives Rudy papers left by his father in which Ozzie explains he had discovered the lost manuscripts of the Order, lost since the Crusades, and that the new sect within the Order does not wish for them to be revealed because they show the location of a mythical Jewish treasure. Rudy shows it to Avram, who insists that the \"treasure\" is merely a metaphor for the wisdom of the ancient sages and says that its location in the Order's monastery cannot be accessed by outsiders anyway. With Avram's aid Rudy and Lt. Barr pose as foreign members of the Order visiting on a pilgrimage in order to gain access to the monastery during a massive assembly of the members, now led by Cyrus. In the catacombs Rudy finds the remaining manuscripts as well as his imprisoned father and a large bomb. Ben Ner arrives and explains to Rudy and Lt. Barr that he joined the Order when he found out about the treasure. Cyrus arrives and forces Ozzie to lead him through the tunnels in order to detonate the bomb under the Temple Mount during Ramadan to maximize casualties and make martyrs of the Israeli Lt. Barr and American Rudy Cafmeyer in order to trigger World War III. Rudy saves Avram from falling into a pit trap before they reach a room loaded with treasure next to the chamber underneath the Well of Souls. Ben Ner attempts to delay the detonation in order to collect more treasure, leading to a standoff with Cyrus's followers. Rudy, and Lt. Barr use the opportunity to escape but Ozzy is injured and Avram is killed. Lt. Barr shoots Ben Ner and helps Ozzie out of the catacombs. Rudy catches Cyrus in the treasure room and kills him with one of the swords found there. Rudy moves the bomb from under the Well of Souls and drops it into the pit trap. Ben Ner jumps at Rudy but only grabs his shirt and tears it off as he falls into the pit. Rudy races away from the pit as the bomb explodes. Worshipers above hear the explosion but continue praying. Rudy is later shown visiting the office of his father, who has published a new book. In the office Rudy finds an ancient map that Ozzie claims shows the location of the Seven Cities of Gold. Rudy grabs the map and runs out of the office with Dalia. The film ends with a compilation of quick action cuts as well as a few outtakes."

Had we maintained the light-heartedness all the way to the end, I believe the film would have been far more successful. For me the highlight of that movie is the chase through the Old City of Jerusalem, with Van Damme disguised as a Hasidic Jew, running from and fighting with the Israeli police. It was utterly wacky and outrageous, and to this day I'm still amazed that I convinced Jean-Claude to do it."

Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy, and Science Officer Spock beam to the surface but find the research station deserted. Chief Engineer Scott moves Enterprise to a safe distance to protect it from being bombarded by a solar flare. The landing party is suddenly transported into an underground chamber and discover that they are trapped along with a beautiful mute woman, whom McCoy names \"Gem\". The landing party is attacked by two aliens, Lal and Thann, from a race of humanoid beings known as Vians, who proceed to injure Kirk. Gem proves she is an empath by absorbing Kirk's injuries, briefly taking them on herself before they are healed. They search the nearby chambers and find machinery and computer systems, along with transparent cylinders, some containing the missing research personnel in grotesque poses, and three empty ones labeled with the landing party's names. Lal arrives, but Spock subdues him with a Vulcan nerve pinch and allows the group to escape to the surface. They are surprised to see Scott and a landing party waiting for them, but soon discover they are only a mirage. The Vians arrive and transport Gem and Kirk back into the underground complex, where they begin torturing Kirk with Gem only able to watch. During this, the aliens explain that they had tested the research personnel (Linke and Ozaba) similarly, but both men died from their fears. Gem and a badly injured Kirk are transported back to where McCoy and Spock are held, and Gem heals Kirk's wounds, but only after McCoy urges her to do so. The Vians demand another test subject, and McCoy sedates both Kirk and Spock to make the Vians choose him. When Kirk and Spock awaken, they understand from Gem what McCoy has done and make their escape to find McCoy near death at the medical chamber after being subjected to the Vians' tests. Kirk and Spock attempt to help McCoy but are stopped by the Vians' use of a force field. They can only stand by and watch as Gem attempts to absorb McCoy's wounds, though she seems afraid to take the entirety of them upon herself. The Vians then explain that this has all been a test for Gem as a representative of her people in this solar system. They have been trying to judge if Gem was willing to sacrifice her life for that of another; if she passed the test, the Vians would use their advanced technology to save the rest of Gem's people from the pending supernova. Gem attempts again to absorb McCoy's wounds but he pushes her away, not wanting her to die. Spock observes the force field reacts to resistant force, and theorizes that total calm would dissipate the field, allowing them the opportunity to overtake the Vians. Kirk insists to the Vians that Gem has proven her choice is to sacrifice herself, and furthermore accuses the aliens of lacking compassion. The Vians realize their error, and, in silence, seemingly agree that Gem has passed the test. They return Gem and McCoy to full health, and promise to save Gem's people. The Vians and Gem disappear. Kirk, Spock and McCoy return to the Enterprise safely. After hearing the trio discussing the probability of meeting a woman like Gem, Scott comments that she must have been a \"pearl of great price\" and they agree."

It was inspired by the 1933 science fiction novel When Worlds Collide, and also by an ancient Egyptian custom of inviting a person to speak on behalf of another who was being judged. Muskat was also working at a local theater, and wanted her story to be shot on a bare, surreal set, like a stage play that focused on the characters. Her theater employer, playwright and screenwriter Robert Fisher, liked the script and, acting as her agent, submitted it. Star Trek producers Gene Roddenberry, Fred Freiberger and Robert Justman all thought it had promise, but agreed there would have to be some changes. Muskat reworked the script based on their input. Freiberger, Justman and Story consultant Arthur Singer made further changes and Singer also gave the story a new title, \"The Empath\". Since Muskat was not a member of the Writers Guild, Star Trek would be saving money, which was becoming very tight."

They are also competing with other scientists in the UK, and with international scientists such as American Linus Pauling. The film manages to convey the loneliness and competitiveness of scientific research but also educates the viewer about how DNA's structure was discovered. It explores the tension between the patient, dedicated laboratory work of Franklin and the sometimes uninformed intuitive leaps of Watson and Crick, against a background of institutional turf wars, personality conflicts, and sexism. In the film, Watson, extolling the path of intuition, says: \"Blessed are they who believed before there was any evidence.\" It also shows how Watson and Crick made their discovery, overtaking their competitors in part by reasoning from genetic function to predict chemical structure, helping to establish the field of molecular biology."

The following night, Lillian is found to have died of a heart attack. The Liptons are surprised by the death because she seemed so healthy and are suspicious of Paul's cheerfulness so soon after his wife's death. Carol starts to investigate, even inventing an excuse to visit him. An urn she finds in Paul's apartment contradicts his story that Lillian had been buried. Larry becomes frustrated with Carol, telling her she's \"inventing a mystery\". Carol sneaks into Paul's apartment while he's away and finds more telling signs. Lillian's urn is missing, there are two tickets to Paris and hotel reservations with a woman named Helen Moss. Carol calls Ted, a close friend who agrees with Carol's suspicions and urges her to keep snooping. When Paul returns unexpectedly, Carol hides under the bed and overhears Paul's conversation with a woman who she suspects is Helen Moss. Ted tracks down where Helen Moss lives, and with Carol and Larry, they follow her to a theater owned by Paul. They discover that Helen is a young actress and eavesdrop on them talking about money. A few days later, Carol spots a woman who's a dead ringer for the supposedly dead Lillian on a passing bus. Upon Larry's suggestion that she has a twin, Ted investigates but finds Lillian has none. Larry and Carol follow her to a hotel and, under the pretense of delivering a personal gift, they enter her hotel room, but find her lying dead on the bedroom floor. They call the police, who subsequently find no trace of the dead body. The Liptons search the room for clues. While leaving, they get trapped in the lift and accidentally stumble across Lillian's body inside the emergency exit panel. At that moment, the lights go out and the Liptons stumble into the basement in pitch darkness. Upon exiting to the street, they spot Paul putting the body in the trunk of his car. They follow him to a junk yard where they witness him disposing of the body into a melting furnace. The Liptons meet Ted and Larry's friend and client Marcia Fox and hatch a plan to bring Paul to justice by telling him they retrieved Lillian's body from the furnace and tricking Helen into a fake audition where her voice is recorded, edited, and later used to harass Paul, by demanding he give Larry and Carol $200,000 or kill them if he wanted everything covered up. Marcia also tells them her theory that the dead body in the apartment is Lillian's rich sister who looked similar to her and that when she visited the Houses she had a heart attack. They then took advantage of the situation by claiming Lillian had died so that they could profit from her will. However Paul double-crossed Lillian and killed her so that he could run away with Helen who he had been having an affair with. The plan backfires as Paul kidnaps Carol and calls Larry, demanding Lillian's body, in exchange for Carol. Paul and Larry meet in the theater and get into a scuffle. Larry breaks free and searches for Carol, with Paul in pursuit. An array of mirrors and glass behind the theater reflect the movie being screened (Orson Welles' The Lady from Shanghai) and mislead Paul several times. Suddenly, Paul's loyal assistant Mrs. Dalton, an older paramour earlier brushed aside by him in favor of Helen, shoots him in an exchange of gunfire. Larry rescues Carol and they call the police. After the cops arrive, Marcia discusses with Ted that her theory was correct and they arrange to have dinner together."

        "content": "Allen started Manhattan Murder Mystery as an early draft of Annie Hall, but he did not feel that it was substantial enough, and he decided to go in a different direction. He had put off making the film for years because he felt it was too lightweight, \"like an airplane book read\". Allen decided to revisit the material in the early 1990s. He contacted Marshall Brickman, who co-wrote Annie Hall, and they developed the story further. The role of Carol was originally written for Mia Farrow, but the part was recast when she and Allen ended their relationship and became embroiled in a custody battle over their three children. Allegations in the media claimed that changes were made to the film in what was \"definitely a reaction\" to Allen's relationship problems, including the casting of Anjelica Huston as \"a much younger first time novelist\" with whom Allen's character became romantically involved (Huston was 41 during production). In the fall of 1992, Allen called Diane Keaton and asked her to fill in for Farrow, and she immediately accepted. When asked if he had re-written the script to fit Keaton's talents, Allen said: Making the film was a form of escape for Allen because the \"past year was so exhausting that I wanted to just indulge myself in something I could relax and enjoy\". He also found it very therapeutic working with Keaton again. After getting over her initial panic in her first scene with Alan Alda, Keaton and Allen slipped back into their old rhythm. After she had trouble with that scene, Allen decided to re-shoot it. In the meantime, she worked with her acting coach and did other scenes that went well. According to Allen, Keaton changed the dynamic of the film because he \"always look(s) sober and normal compared to Keaton. I turn into the straight man\". Huston said that the set was \"oddly free of anxiety, introspection and pain\", and this was due to Keaton's presence. The film was shot in the fall of 1992 on the streets of Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side. Allen had cinematographer Carlo Di Palma rely on hand-held cameras, \"swiveling restlessly from one room to another, or zooming in abruptly for a close look.\" Larry and Carol Lipton's apartment is at 200 East 78th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenue and between two groups of New York City Designated Landmarks, east of one group of rowhouses and west of another group. Allen staged a climactic shoot-out in a roomful of mirrors that, according to Allen, referenced a similar shoot-out in Orson Welles' film The Lady from Shanghai. The film marked Allen's second and final film with TriStar Pictures, and it was speculated in the press that this deal was not extended because of the filmmaker's personal problems or that his films were not very profitable. Allen, however, denied these allegations in interviews at the time. Zach Braff, who was 17-years-old at the time, appeared in one scene as Nick Lipton, the son of Larry and Carol. Years later, he said: \"When I look at that scene now, all I can see is the terror in my eyes.\u201d"

Gotti's association with three mobsters is also highlighted in the film: a father-son like relationship with family underboss Aniello \"Mr. Neil\" Dellacroce, his deep but rocky friendship with Gotti crew member and longtime friend Angelo Ruggiero, and the respect and ultimate frustration that he felt for the man who became his underboss, Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano. The film details Gotti's rise within the Gambino crime family and his ranks from soldier, then captain (or capo), and finally, boss. The final title was achieved through the dramatic murder in public of Gambino family boss Paul Castellano in 1985. Following the murder of Castellano, the film concentrates on the legal trials of John Gotti: one for assault and two for racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes. Gotti's famous personality, trial acquittals, and media attention are all dramatized. The film ends with Gotti's conviction and sentencing to life imprisonment at Marion Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, because Gravano turns state's evidence and agrees to testify against Gotti.  The film is primarily based on the columns of reporter Jerry Capeci, who also wrote the novel that documented Gotti's rise and fall inside the Gambino crime family, and served as executive producer of the film which was based on his novel."

Captain Kirk beams down with a landing party to a city with no evidence of life, except for an intermittent insect-like buzzing. Crewman Compton disappears before Dr. McCoy's eyes, and Kirk orders the away team back to the Enterprise. Upon their return, the ship begins to experience strange malfunctions, and Engineering reports the sudden appearance of an unknown device attached to the ship's life support systems. Kirk and Spock attempt to disconnect the device but are prevented from doing so by an unseen force. Back on the bridge, Kirk decides to allow the unseen enemy to take the next step, and asks for coffee. As he sips it, the bridge crew appear to slow down. A woman appears, who introduces herself as Deela, \"the enemy\". She explains that Kirk has been placed in a state of hyperacceleration, rendering him invisible to the rest of his crew, but allowing him to see and hear the Scalosians. Kirk returns to Life Support and discovers that Compton is still alive, having also been accelerated, and is willingly working with the Scalosians. After a confrontation with Deela's chief scientist Rael, Kirk surmises that the unknown device is intended to turn the Enterprise into a cryogenic storage unit. He records a message to Spock explaining what he has learned; Deela, confident in her people's success, allows this. Their plan, she explains, is to use the Enterprise crew to help propagate their species, whose men have been rendered sterile by the same natural disaster that caused their accelerated state. After a heated debate on the ethics of this plan, Kirk rushes away and disables the transporter. Deela, finding it inoperative, pretends to believe Kirk's claim to be ignorant of the problem. Kirk begins to exhibit the sort of docility seen with Compton; however, this is a ruse that allows him to seize Deela's weapon. On his way to Life Support, Kirk meets newly accelerated Spock, who has heard Kirk's message and determined the cause of his hyperacceleration was a dose of the polluted Scalosian water. The two arrive at Life Support, where Kirk uses the Scalosian weapon to stun Rael and destroy the cryogenic device. After transporting Deela and her party back to the planet, Spock reveals that he has brought a possible antidote to the Scalosian water. Kirk takes a dose immediately, while Spock takes advantage of his accelerated state to effect repairs on the Enterprise."

He found the science wanting, though \"I have to admit that here it provides for one of the series' more original 'redshirt deaths.'\" Ward did admire the set design: \"Clever use of tilted camera angles and lighting help to sell the illusion of the characters moving about the ship at their hyper-accelerated rate. One nice touch is the slowing down of the various lights and gauges that fill the bridge's workstations when Kirk and Deela are there.\" David Alan Mack, also a Star Trek novelist, wrote, \"It's not a bad idea for an episode, but the execution on this one felt sorely lacking.\" He noted some gaps in logic: \"Still, how does one propagate a species by mating one's women with aliens? ...\u00a0And if time moves so slowly for them, why would they need to place the Enterprise crew in suspended animation? Wouldn't a few days' worth of knockout drugs suffice?\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club was unimpressed by the episode, assigning it a B- and noting some plot holes: \"They manage to beam aboard the Enterprise somehow, which doesn't make a lot of sense, science-wise. If their speed makes them invisible to the computer as life-forms, how would the transporter even work? Especially since they get brought on without anyone on the ship realizing it.\" Handlen judges that the \"hook is clever,\" although \"the ep might've been stronger if it had spent more time focusing on the mystery, and the danger that mystery represented, instead of dropping Kirk down the rabbit hole and spoiling the question so early on.\" He concludes, \"In a stronger season, 'Eye' would've been a low spot, a perfunctory by-the-numbers programmer which, while not embarrassing, wouldn't have made much of an impression. Here, it reminds us that, for a while anyway, competency was the least we could hope to expect from the series.\" Melissa N. Hayes-Gehrke of the University of Maryland found more problems with the science: StarTrekReviews.com found some praise: \"There's no character interaction between our heroes, save for the wonderful moment when Kirk meets Spock in the corridor and simply smiles\"."

        "content": "The Federation starship Enterprise arrives at the planet Sarpeidon, whose star is soon to go nova. Surprised to find the surface devoid of humanoid life, Kirk, Dr. McCoy and Spock beam down to investigate. They encounter one last remaining resident, a librarian named Mr. Atoz. Aware of the imminent destruction, Atoz tells the landing party that he will soon escape to rejoin his family. Atoz shows them the Atavachron, a machine with a time portal. They hear a woman scream. Kirk instinctively runs through the portal and McCoy and Spock follow. Atoz tries to warn them that they were not \"prepared.\" Kirk finds himself in a period similar to 17th century England while McCoy and Spock travel back 5,000 years to Sarpeidon's ice age. They cannot locate the portal, but the three are able to speak to each other. Spock surmises that the Sarpeidons have all escaped to their planet's past. The woman who screamed is a thief, and the policemen who come to arrest her hear Kirk speaking to his friends and suspect him of being a witch. In the jail, Kirk mentions the Atavachron to the interrogating prosecutor. This startles him, and Kirk suspects he is also from the future. Kirk escapes his cell by luring his jailer close and overpowering him. The prosecutor confirms his suspicions but explains that returning to the future would be fatal, since the time travel preparation involves changes to the traveler's biology. Kirk tells him that he went through no such preparation. The prosecutor informs him that an \"unprepared\" person cannot survive in the past for more than a few hours, just as a \"prepared\" person cannot survive in the present. The prosecutor leads Kirk to the portal, and Kirk returns to the present. McCoy and Spock are saved by Zarabeth, a woman who takes them to a sheltering cave. Upon arrival in the past, Spock begins displaying uncharacteristic emotionalism: He continues carrying McCoy when logic would dictate he abandon him, he falls in love with Zarabeth, and he reacts with anger at McCoy's racial slurs. As McCoy recovers from severe exposure, Zarabeth explains to Spock that she too is from Sarpeidon's future, but a tyrant banished her to this era, in which she is the only extant humanoid. She also explains that the Atavachron is a one-way trip. Spock accepts this and becomes increasingly hostile to McCoy's continued desire to return to the present. McCoy accuses Zarabeth of lying about their inability to return because she is desperate not to be abandoned to unending loneliness again, and says that Spock backs her out of emotional attachment. McCoy realizes that being brought 5,000 years into the past is causing Spock to revert to the barbarism of the ancient Vulcans. Realizing the emotionalism of his behavior, Spock asks Zarabeth again about the portal. She admits she doesn't know what the effect of a return trip will be on him and McCoy. Back in the library, despite Kirk's explaining that they are not from Sarpeidon, Atoz stuns him and tries to force him back into the portal. Kirk awakens, overpowers Atoz and forces him to help find McCoy and Spock. Eventually Kirk is able to talk with the two. Unwilling to leave Zarabeth, and still unaware that he will die soon if he remains in the past, Spock tries to send McCoy through the portal alone. However, because McCoy and Spock went through the portal together, neither one can go back without the other. Upon their return, Atoz hurries through the portal to his chosen era. Spock reverts to his normal self, and with little time to spare they are beamed back to the Enterprise."

A 2018 Star Trek binge-watching guide by Den of Geek, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of the original series. In 2019, Nerdist News included this episode on their \"Best of Spock\" binge-watching guide. They also ranked it the tenth best time travel episode of the Star Trek franchise, including the later 750+ episodes. They note this episode for featuring Spock's travels to an ancient ice age of an alien world, and at that time his emotions are triggered by a woman and the effects of time travel.  In the series, they remarked that normally the character does not have much emotion, so seeing the character deal with emotions provides a change of pace for the character's presentation."

The episode was written by Conan O'Brien and directed by Rich Moore. Recurring guest star Phil Hartman provided the voice of Lyle Lanley, while Leonard Nimoy made a guest appearance as himself. \"Marge vs. the Monorail\" has been widely praised by fans and critics and is generally considered one of the best episodes of The Simpsons. O'Brien has said that, of the episodes he wrote, this was his favorite. Nimoy's unexpected guest appearance was also widely praised.

After a few suggestions\u2014including one from a poorly-disguised Burns to invest it back into his power plant\u2014Marge nearly convinces them to repair the rundown Main Street but a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley leads a song-and-dance routine that convinces the townspeople to instead build a monorail. After running a questionable training program, Lanley randomly selects Homer as the monorail's conductor. Doubtful about Lanley, Marge visits his office and discovers he intends to run off with money skimmed from the project, leaving the townspeople with a defective train. Marge drives to the town of North Haverbrook, a previous purchaser of one of Lanley's monorails. She discovers the town and its monorail in ruins. She meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed it and he confirms that all of Lanley's monorail projects are scams. Cobb offers to help Marge prevent Springfield from suffering the same fate. At the Springfield monorail's inaugural run, Lanley arranges for Leonard Nimoy to be present at a well-attended opening ceremony, which is a diversion that enables him to escape on a plane to Tahiti. When the flight makes an unexpected stopover in North Haverbrook, the townsfolk storm the aircraft to attack Lanley for ruining the town. Back in Springfield, the monorail leaves the station just before Marge and Cobb arrive and soon goes out of control, causing the solar-powered train to over-speed round the track, endangering Homer, Bart and everyone on board. The train stops briefly during a solar eclipse, then starts again. As Chief Wiggum and Mayor Quimby argue over who takes charge, Marge and Cobb contact Homer by radio and Cobb tells him he must find an anchor to stop the train. Improvising quickly, Homer pries loose the metal \"M\" from the engine's side logo, ties a rope to it and throws it from the train. After damaging a large portion of the town\u2014especially the already-derelict roads\u2014the \"M\" catches on the giant donut of the Lard Lad Donut store's sign and the rope holds, stopping the monorail. As the passengers are rescued, Marge concludes that the monorail was the only foolish project the town ever embarked on, except for a skyscraper made from Popsicle sticks, a 50-foot-tall magnifying glass, and an up-escalator that leads nowhere."

He first pitched this episode at a story retreat to Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who said the episode was a little crazy and thought he should try some other material first. O'Brien had previously pitched episodes where Lisa had a rival and where Marge gets a job at the power plant and Mr. Burns falls in love with her; both went well. James L. Brooks \"absolutely loved\" this episode when O'Brien presented it. Leonard Nimoy was not originally considered for the role as the celebrity at the maiden voyage of the monorail, as the writing staff did not think he would accept, because William Shatner had previously turned the show down. Instead, George Takei was asked to guest star, as he had previously appeared as Akira in the second season episode \"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\". After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying he did not want to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority). As a result, the staff went to Nimoy, who accepted. Writer Jeff Martin said Nimoy was \"just very gracious and easy to work with, and a good sport when we went and recorded his voice.\" Phil Hartman was cast as Lanley because, as Reiss put it, he \"was always pretending to be a glad-handing salesman.\" Martin added, \"He was very good at portraying slick, empty people. I think he brought a lot of joy to it.\" Director Rich Moore and animator David Silverman called the production process for this episode \"huge and ambitious\". Because of limited design resources, Moore took photos of buildings to use for various shots. The Lanley Institute came from a building in old town Pasadena. Different locations in North Haverbrook were all photos taken around North Hollywood. Moore bypassed the design team and provided the photos directly to background layout artist Nancy Kruse."

The episode was written by Herbert Wright, based on a story by Larry Forrester, and directed by Rob Bowman. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is given his former vessel, the Stargazer, as a gift by the Ferengi DaiMon Bok (Frank Corsentino) who intends to use it to take revenge upon the Enterprise captain. The Stargazer was to originally be represented by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard the bridge of the Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Enterprise bridge set (which had also been re-dressed to serve as the Enterprise-D \u201cbattle bridge\u201d in the pilot episode)."

Picard is suffering from persistent headaches, whose cause Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) is unable to determine. Meanwhile a second vessel approaches and is identified as a Federation Constellation-class starship. Bok transports to the bridge of the Enterprise, and announces that the newly arrived ship is a gift for \"the hero of Maxia.\" Data (Brent Spiner) reminds Picard that nine years earlier at Maxia he was attacked by an unidentified aggressor which he destroyed. Bok reveals that the ship in question was Ferengi. Bok's gift is identified as the Stargazer, Picard's former command, which Bok found as a derelict. Picard explains that at Maxia, the crew was forced to abandon ship, despite winning the battle by an action that would come to be known as the \"Picard Maneuver\", a short warp jump that caused the enemy vessel's light-speed limited sensors to detect the Stargazer in two places at once. Picard and an away team board the Stargazer, and he orders a chest of his belongings sent to the Enterprise. Hidden in the chest is an orb, apparently under Bok's control, that subjects Picard to a wave of pain. Dr. Crusher orders him back to the Enterprise. Data finds an entry in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce, but he and La Forge determine that this entry was faked. Wesley detects unusual signals from the Ferengi ship, and the Enterprise computer informs William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that Picard has returned to the Stargazer. Picard finds Bok waiting for him with another orb. Bok explains that his son was in command of the Ferengi vessel at Maxia, and that Bok is taking revenge. He sets the orb down and leaves Picard on the Stargazer bridge. The orb lights up, and Picard suddenly believes he is once again at the Battle of Maxia, and that the Enterprise is the attacker. On the Enterprise, Lieutenant Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lieutenant Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who reveals that the orb is a banned device, and promises to investigate. Riker subsequently hails the Stargazer, but Picard continues to believe he is being attacked by the Enterprise. Riker asks Data to devise a countermeasure to the Picard Maneuver. When Picard takes the Stargazer to warp, Data uses the Enterprises tractor beam to seize the Stargazer and limit its field of fire. Riker tells Picard about the orb; Picard seems to understand and destroys it with his phaser. After a few moments, Picard hails the Enterprise and requests a transport. Kazago hails Riker to inform him that Bok has been relieved of command \"for engaging in this unprofitable venture\"."

        "content": "\"The Battle\" marked the second appearance of the Ferengi, but executive producer Rick Berman thought that they still didn't make a decent major adversary. Larry Forester's script, his second for The Next Generation, originally featured several scenes on board the Ferengi ship to cast further light on their culture but they were all ultimately cut before filming. Bok would return in the seventh-season episode \"Bloodlines\", although the role would be recast with Lee Arenberg gaining the role instead of Frank Corsentino. Rob Bowman used a couple of specific camera techniques for the scenes on board the Stargazer during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, and each of the Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, \"we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. For me, it was a real creative stretch and it felt great for the show.\" The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Enterprise bridge. The term \"Picard Maneuver\" was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age. The Constellation-class starship first appears in \"Encounter at Farpoint\" as a desktop model in Picard's ready room. Rick Sternbach constructed the model by kitbashing Ertl kits of the movie Enterprise, using parts from other models such as the VF-1 Valkyrie to add detail. Greg Jein used Sternbach's and Andrew Probert's designs to create the four-foot shooting model of the USS Stargazer for \"The Battle\". In the original script, the Stargazer was to be a redress of the movie-era Constitution-class Enterprise model that first appeared in Star Trek: The Motion Picture; Probert and Sternbach persuaded the producers not to reuse the movie Enterprise model, and the \"Constellation\"-class label was chosen so that it could match LeVar Burton's lip movement to redub dialogue. This episode is noted for featuring special effect sequences with a Constellation-class starship in outer space. This design is used again in the episode \"Peak Performance\" (Season 2 Episode 21 of TNG)."

Sergeant Ray Dunbar emerges from the jungle carrying wounded Second Lieutenant Levi Kendall. The two men are pursued by Sergeant Mueller, whom Dunbar kills in self-defense. Although no other bodies are found, West's team is presumed dead. Dunbar refuses to talk to Military Police investigator Captain Julia Osborne and insists on speaking to a fellow Ranger from outside the base, drawing an '8' on a piece of paper. The post commander Colonel Bill Styles calls in his friend: experienced interrogator, ex-Ranger and now DEA agent Tom Hardy, and assigns him to aid Osborne. During interrogations of the survivors, they learn that West was infamous for being a ruthless, tough-as-nails sergeant. One of the trainees, Jay Pike, earned West's wrath for not following orders, and may have staged the murder. Kendall, son of a Joint Chiefs of Staff general and a homosexual, claims West hated him and may have ordered a \"training accident\" on him. He claims West died when hit in the back with a phosphorus grenade. When Pike confessed to the crime, Dunbar wanted to turn him in; a firefight ensued and most of the trainees were killed. Dunbar claims Kendall is lying and that Mueller and his fellow trainee Castro were illegally selling prescription drugs and West became aware of their drug dealing. Mueller used Pike's grenade to kill West and tried to frame Pike. A firefight broke out and several trainees were killed. Dunbar claims that Dr. Peter Vilmer supplied the drugs and falsified drug tests so that soldiers came out clean. After confessing to the crime, Vilmer is placed under arrest. Styles orders Osborne and Hardy not to talk to Kendall again. They disobey and interrogate Kendall once more, but he suddenly begins vomiting blood. Before dying, he draws an '8' with his own blood on Osborne's hand. Hardy explains a rumor about a group of ex-Rangers in Panama calling themselves \"Section 8\". They apparently trained under West, turned rogue and became drug dealers. Styles is furious; he relieves Osborne of duty and tells Hardy to leave. He considers the investigation closed and a CID transport from Washington arrives to take Vilmer and Dunbar away. Vilmer accidentally reveals that 'Dunbar' is actually Pike, and Hardy removes Pike from the plane just before takeoff. Pike explains that West learned about the actual operation going on at the base: cocaine smuggling. He confronted the Rangers and threatened to turn them in to authorities. After a brief firefight, West and the other trainees were killed. Pike took Dunbar's dog tags and carried Kendall to the extraction point. He then gives Hardy, Osborne, and Styles the number of a crate where Vilmer had stowed cocaine. Hardy confronts Styles, determining he was behind the drug-dealing operation the whole time. When West reported the operation to Styles, Styles ordered Mueller and Kendall to kill him in the jungle, then poisoned Kendall to silence him. Styles tries to bribe Hardy before attempting to shoot him; Styles is instead shot and killed by Osborne, who was eavesdropping on their talk. As the investigation concludes, Osborne suspects that Hardy is somehow involved in the incident; this is confirmed when she watches Pike sneak into Hardy's car. She follows them into Panama City, where they enter a bar with a big eight-ball hanging above. After going inside, she is greeted by West and the missing members of the team \u2014 Castro, Dunbar, and Nu\u00f1ez, who Hardy reveals as his 'colleagues'. They explain that Section 8 is a covert black-ops anti-drug unit led by Colonel Tom Hardy; the \"insane mercenary\" story is a cover to spook the cartels. The agents infiltrated the base undercover to investigate cocaine trafficking and discovered Mueller, Kendall and Vilmer were responsible. West, not realizing Styles was also involved, informed him of the drug dealing. The training mission became a covert Section 8 operation to circumvent Mueller and Kendall and fake West's death in order to extract West from leadership and transfer him to Section 8. Hardy was called in to confirm Styles' and Vilmer's involvement. Impressed by her work, Hardy offers Osborne a job in the unit."

Through the windows of the art room, the class watches Buffy tell her that Joyce has died. Dawn collapses, wailing. In Willow's dormitory room, Tara tries to help Willow find a shirt to wear. Xander and Anya arrive. Willow panics, rejecting shirt after shirt, not knowing how to appear for Buffy and Dawn. Anya asks Xander what she is supposed to do; he cannot answer. Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors. Anya asks if they will see the body, then if the body will be cut open, and Willow responds angrily. Anya tearfully says she does not understand how to behave, or why Joyce cannot go back into her own body, unable to understand human death. The group then leaves to visit Buffy, Dawn and Giles at the hospital. In the waiting room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an aneurysm suddenly and painlessly. Dawn goes alone to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her. As Buffy kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother's body, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek."

Kishan, a wealthy businessman, allows Suman to stay at his house while her father is away as he cannot turn down his old friend's request. Suman is befriended by Kishan's young son Prem, who assures her that a boy and a girl can be platonic friends. Prem takes Suman to a party organised by Seema, who is the only daughter of Kishan's business partner, Ranjeet. Jeevan, nephew of Ranjeet, is proud and arrogant and humiliates Suman and Prem, accusing them of falsely claiming to be \"just friends\".

Prem's mother Kaushalya probes deeper into Prem and Suman's relationship and approves of Suman as her daughter-in-law.

        "content": "The casting of the lead actor was complex. Several newcomers were auditioned for the role of 'Prem', including Vindu Dara Singh, Deepak Tijori, and Faraaz Khan. While Faraaz Khan, son of the actor Yusuf Khan who played the villainous Zabisco in Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), was almost finalised for the role, but he was replaced at the last minute due to health issues. Barjatya tested Shabina Dutt for the lead actress role. Dutt failed the screen test and Barjatya asked if she could suggest an actor for the lead. She suggested Salman Khan, with whom she had done an ad film. Salman Khan was not particularly interested because of the soft nature of the film and Barjatya was not very happy with the Khan's first audition. Sooraj wasn't convinced with Salman's acting prowess and started looking for another actor to play the role. Khan too, started suggesting names for who could be Prem in the film, after he was told that he didn't fit the bill. Barjatya eventually convinced him to do it, and Khan has since then expressed his gratitude to Barjatya for making him a star. Barjatya loved Tom Cruise's Top Gun jacket so much that he designed a one on the similar lines for Khan in Maine Pyar Kiya. Like Tom Cruise\u2019s jacket, which had patches of logos and emblems of the American Army, Navy and Air Force insignia, and other badges from the defence forces, Khan\u2019s jacket too had similar insignias pasted on it. Barjatya then cast Bhagyashree to star opposite Salman Khan. Bhagyashree, who had a lead role in Amol Palekar's TV show Kachchi Dhoop, had refused to do the film as she wanted to pursue higher studies. Barjatya made several changes to the script; Bhagyashree eventually agreed to do the film. Though Salman recommended Bahl for villain\u2019s role, veteran actress and Mohnish Bahl's mother Nutan was not happy with her son playing villain's role in the film. Nutan, who shared a good rapport with the Barjatyas, had reportedly also asked if Mohnish could fit in other roles. Makers assured her that Bahl's character would be remembered for a long time to come. Barjatya picked Perveen from the English stage to play the negative role. The film also marked the debut of Laxmikant Berde."

        "content": "Two lonesome Texas Rangers, Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) and Maggie Swanson (Liz Vassey), question Percy Stevens (Cedric the Entertainer) about the whereabouts of his former prison roommate, Morgan Ball (Curtis Armstrong), who they want to testify against organized crime boss John Cortland (Turner Stephen Bruton). Sharp and Swanson track down Ball to the warehouse, where Ball gives Sharp a key in an attempt to buy him off. Instead, Sharp takes the key and forces Ball outside, where FBI agent Eddie Zane (Brian Van Holt) is waiting. As they talk, a sniper begins shooting, wounding Swanson and giving Ball a chance to escape (although Swanson is shot in the chest, she survives due to the bullet missing her heart). It is revealed the sniper is after Ball, and a group of cheerleaders from the University of Texas at Austin witness his murder. Agent Zane is found shot in the arm next to Ball's body and claims he didn't see the sniper. Anne (Christina Milian), Teresa (Paula Garc\u00e9s), Evie (Monica Keena), Heather (Vanessa Ferlito) and Barb (Kelli Garner) are taken to the police station, where they all have conflicting descriptions of the shooter. Sharp is given the task of protecting the girls at all times, because their fathers are worried about them. The information is relayed to him by the Governor of Texas (Rick Perry). It is revealed that Sharp is divorced and has a daughter, Emma (Shannon Marie Woodward) who is in high school and doesn't feel as though her father had ever been around. John Cortland is exonerated from all charges pressed against him due to a lack of evidence. FBI Agent Zane is revealed to be working with Cortland, having killed Ball and shot himself in the arm. Cortland scolds Zane for letting some \"loose ends\" escape, and Zane begins searching for Sharp and the cheerleaders; he also kills the sniper he hired. With Swanson in the hospital recovering from her near-fatal wound, Sharp and two additional Rangers must now pick the girls up from school and secure their sorority house. Sharp moves in with the girls and the two young Rangers working with him move into the fraternity house across the street, where they end up busting a drug deal. Sharp sets some ground rules, including no cell phones. He also tells them to \"cover up in his presence\" (referring to the girls' revealing clothes). When they fail to comply, he orders a massive industrial air conditioner, forcing them to dress warmly. Sharp is posing as a cheerleading coach specializing in conditioning, and at a Longhorns football game he tackles an opposing team's mascot when the mascot approaches the girls with a gun, later revealed to be a water gun. Other humorous mishaps occur, but Sharp's relationship with the girls begins to strengthen; Barb even begins to develop a crush on him. However, Sharp finds himself attracted to Barb's English teacher Molly (Anne Archer) who calls him into her office to complain about Barb's plagiarism. Later he invites her over for dinner, which the girls coach him through using an earpiece and tiny video screen. After they fall asleep, he turns it off and woos Molly himself. He admits to the girls about his last failed marriage and the way he feels about his estranged daughter. This interests Evie, who has a 4.0 GPA and wants to write a paper on Emma. She uses the house's \"emergency phone\" to call her, revealing Sharp's location to Zane, who had contacted Emma. Sharp takes the girls to a \"spirit rally\", where he is forced to give a speech about cheerleading. He becomes more and more impassioned, proving to the girls he finally \"gets it\". The night is ruined, however, when Sharp realizes in the nick of time that somebody put a bomb under their van, and Teresa (who was convinced that nobody was after them) is almost killed when her seatbelt gets stuck. Sharp saves her, and she admits that maybe someone is trying to kill them. Evie tells Sharp she contacted Emma, and when Sharp calls his daughter he learns that Zane has her. He tells Sharp to take the key Ball gave him to open a lockbox, both of them unaware the cheerleaders are listening in. The next day Sharp gets the money out of the lockbox and drives to where Zane instructs him. Zane gives Sharp instructions over a cell phone, telling him he will shoot Emma if Sharp disobeys. After Sharp handcuffs himself to the steering wheel, Zane thanks him and tells him he's a \"good parent.\" Zane takes off with the money, Sharp's keys and phone, and Emma. Zane and Emma get on a bus, but as it pulls away Sharp sees Barb in the back. As he wonders what is going on, Heather gets in the car with him and picks his handcuffs. They take off after the bus in a stolen Volkswagen Beetle. On the bus, Teresa pretends to go into labor and Evie demands the bus be stopped. She attempts to steal the bag with the money, but Zane pulls a gun and Evie runs away from the bus. Zane forces all of the other passengers and the driver out, taking over driving the bus himself. Emma is rescued by the cheerleaders, but Zane attempts to drive to Mexico with the bag to hide. Sharp shoots a wheel, causing the bus to flip over 90 degrees. Zane gets out the bus, his face injured after he hits the bus's ceiling. The Mexico\u2013United States border closes and the border officers draw guns on him. Rather than go to jail, Zane attempts suicide by cop. Sharp shoots the gun out of Zane's hand, and handcuffs him with the same cuffs from which Heather freed him earlier. He and Emma are reunited. At the end of the film, Cortland is arrested and taken back to court. Sharp and Molly are married, and Emma and the cheerleaders are part of the wedding."

Nonetheless, he complimented Tommy Lee Jones' \"deadpan\" portrayal, saying \"Whenever Herek doesn't know what to do -- and that's frequently -- he cuts to Jones, radiating world-weariness with the aplomb of Fred Astaire, and it's always funny.\" Dana Stevens of the New York Times wrote: \"Nearly every one of the film's emotional scenes is too predictable to hit its mark, but Mr. Jones's dry delivery has its moments.\" Stevens found Cedric the Entertainer to be disappointing, stating that he \"fails for once to live up to his name\"."

Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell, who owns the Coco Bongo nightclub, plots to overthrow his superior, Niko. One day, Tyrell sends his dazzling singer girlfriend, Tina Carlyle, into the bank to record its layout for an upcoming robbery. Stanley is attracted to Tina and she seemingly reciprocates. Unable to enter the Coco Bongo to watch Tina perform and after his faulty loaner car breaks down while driving home, Stanley despairingly looks over the harbor bridge, lost in thought of what to do. His stream of thought is interrupted, however, when he finds a strange wooden mask near the harbor. Upon returning to his apartment and donning the mask, he becomes a mischievous green-faced figure known as \"The Mask\", who can cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will. With his newfound confidence and lack of inhibitions, Stanley indulges in a comical rampage through the city, humiliating several of his tormentors, including his temperamental landlady, Agnes Peenman, and the mechanics who gave him the faulty car. The next morning, Stanley encounters detective Lieutenant Mitch Kellaway and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt, both of whom are investigating the Mask's activity. To obtain the funds necessary to attend Tina's performance, Stanley again dons the mask and raids the bank, inadvertently foiling Tyrell's robbery in the process. At the Coco Bongo, Stanley becomes infatuated with Tina, who he ends up kissing after sharing an exuberant dance with her. Shortly after, after Tyrell confronts him for disrupting the robbery and stealing his girlfriend, Stanley flees, leaving behind a scrap of cloth from his suit, which turns back into a piece of his pajamas. After arresting Tyrell and his henchman, Kellaway finds the piece of cloth and suspects Stanley to be the perpetrator. The next day, Stanley consults Doctor Arthur Neuman, a psychiatrist who has recently published a book on masks and deduces that the mask is a creation of Loki. It is also revealed that the mask's powers are only active during the night. Later that night, Stanley meets Tina at a local park as the Mask, which initially disturbs her, along with being too strong and wild towards her, but he manages to win her over with his charm and sweet nature to the point they are about to kiss until they are interrupted by Kellaway, who attempts to capture him. Stanley flees with Peggy after he manages to distract the police with a mass performance of the titular song from Cuban Pete; she then betrays him to Tyrell, who was released due to insufficient evidence connecting him or his henchmen to the robbery, for a $50,000 bounty. Tyrell dons the mask, becoming a bulky and malevolent green-faced being. Tyrell's henchmen force Stanley to reveal where the stolen money is, before turning him in to the police. When Tina visits Stanley in the station, he urges her to leave the city. Tina thanks Stanley for showing her kindness and warmth she wasn't used to and tells him he didn't need the mask to be special to her. She attempts to flee, but is kidnapped by Tyrell and forcibly taken to a charity ball at the Coco Bongo, hosted by Niko and attended by the city's elite, including the mayor. Upon arrival, the masked Tyrell kills Niko and prepares to destroy the club with a time bomb. Milo, Stanley's dog, helps Stanley escape from the station by retrieving the keys from the guard. Stanley then sets out to stop Tyrell, taking Kellaway hostage. After locking Kellaway in his car, Stanley enters the club and manages to enlist the help of Charlie, but is soon after discovered and captured. Tina tricks Tyrell into taking off the mask, which is recovered and donned by Milo, who battles his way through Tyrell's henchmen as Stanley and Tyrell fight against each other. After recovering the mask, Stanley uses it to save Tina by disposing of the bomb seconds before it detonates, and then defeats Tyrell by sending him down the drain of the club's ornamental fountain. The police arrive and arrest Tyrell's henchmen. Kellaway attempts to arrest Stanley again, but the mayor intervenes, telling Kellaway and the police that Tyrell was the Mask all along as a way of releasing Stanley. After Stanley and his allies leave, the mayor informs Kellaway that he needs to have a serious meeting with him in the morning. The following day, Stanley, now exonerated and not wanting to encounter the police again, decides to dispose of the mask at the harbor, informing Tina that he will henceforth just be himself. She discards it before sharing a kiss with Stanley, to his delight. During this, Charlie tries to retrieve the mask for himself, only for Milo to swim away with it."

        "content": "Raju (Anil Kapoor) is the only son of his rich landlord father Prem (Akash Khuranna). Raju had lost his mother at birth and feels deeply deprived of a mother's love. On Raju's 5th birthday party, as a promised birthday gift, Prem brings home a new mother Laxmi (Aruna Irani), hoping that she will be a doting and caring mother for Raju. However, Laxmi turns out to be greedy, shrewd and cunning. She married Raju's father only for his vast fortune, money and property. Joining with her brother Totaram (Anupam Kher) and his wife Mynavati (Bharati Achrekar), they conspire on how to transfer all property to Laxmi's name. However, Laxmi and Totaram are enraged when they find out that Prem's first wife had prepared a will before her death transferring all property to Raju. And that Prem is only a trustee to all the wealth.  In the will, it has been written that Raju will have full control of his property only after marriage and unless his wife jointly consents with him, he will not be able to transfer his wealth and property to another name. Laxmi begins her vile schemes. On the front, she puts up an act of being a very loving mother for Raju, who exhilarated for a mother's love, becomes a devoted son. He showers Laxmi with love and respect, ever-ready to obey her every word. In the process, unknowingly, he allows Laxmi to manipulate him. She very cunningly misleads Raju to give up his education. When his father finds out that Raju stopped going to school at Laxmi's instructions, he called out to her to question her. Laxmi and Totaram, hearing Prem, pours oil on the steps causing him to fall down the flight of stairs and hurting his head severely. Using this opportunity, they proved that Prem had become mentally unstable and locked him up in a corner room of the house. Raju being na\u00efve and uneducated, believed every word of his step-mother and her brother. Over the years, Laxmi increasingly isolated his aging father from the family and mainly Raju. One day, Raju meets Saraswati (Madhuri Dixit) at a wedding and falls head over heels in love with her. After some pursuing and an intense incident in her village, Raju and Saraswati gets married. In the meantime, Laxmi fixes an alliance for Raju with an equally uneducated girl from their own village, so that she too can be manipulated and can finally succeed in transferring the property in Laxmi and her son, Ramesh (Adi Irani), Raju's step brother's name. Laxmi is shocked to learn about Raju and Saraswati's marriage. Because Laxmi knew that Saraswati was not only educated but also a very intelligent girl. As usual, Laxmi puts on an act of a doting mother in front of Saraswati also. But Saraswati soon discovers that Laxmi, Totaram, Mainavati, Ramesh and his wife Kunika (Kunika) are all scammers and that their love for Raju is only a ruse. She challenges to expose their deceit to Raju. First thing, Saraswati takes Prem to the temple thus releasing him from the confined room of 20 years. This bold step of Saraswati antogonised Laxmi. Laxmi clearly disapproved of her guts. But Saraswati successfully proved to all that his father was normal. Initially, Saraswati had to bear the brunt of Raju's anger when she tried to convince him of his mother's conniving intentions. After which, Saraswati cleverly exposed every one who had been cheating Raju over the years. For every attempt of Laxmi's schemes, Saraswati wittingly played and backfired their plans ensuring that Raju gets the message and yet not offended. In one incident, Saraswati, along with Prem and their faithful servants Pandu (Laxmikant Berde) and Champa (Priya Arun), planned for Laxmi to slip and fall, forcing her to be bedridden. Promptly, the responsibility of the entire household is handed over to Saraswati. Laxmi is infuriated and plots to get rid of Saraswati for good. When Saraswati becomes pregnant, her father, Shyamlal (Satyen Kappu) comes home with hoards of sweets for her in-laws and a box of saffron. He requests that a pinch of saffron be mixed with milk and be given to Saraswati. Laxmi, adds poison to the box of saffron. She prepares the milk and tells the unaware Raju to give Saraswati the milk along with a pinch of the poisoned saffron. Champa, who witnessed Laxmi mixing the poison, runs to Saraswati's rescue, narrating everything that happened and warns her against drinking the poisoned milk. A devastated Saraswati informs Raju the same. But blinded by Laxmi's love, Raju not only refuses to believe her, he even accuses her of conspiring stories against his mother. In defense, Raju drinks the poisoned milk to prove to Saraswati her error. Raju's world comes crumbling down when he coughed up blood. He, then recollected and realised that everything he had heard about Laxmi all these years from others were eventually true. Yet, Raju could not bring himself to hate Laxmi. His words to Laxmi before dying touched her deeply. Laxmi repented that her greed for wealth stretched a bit too far this time to the point of killing a son who had loved her with a true heart. Saraswati, in the meantime, rushed to get a doctor. On returning she is told that if she wants Raju alive she will have to sign the property transfer papers. Saraswati agrees immediately. However, Laxmi forbids Saraswati from signing it and apologizes to her. A fight ensues between Laxmi and Ramesh. Totaram and Mynavati also joins with Ramesh. Ultimately, it required Raju himself to come forward to save Laxmi from being killed by Ramesh. Eventually Raju recovers and hands over the signed property papers to Prem. He bids good-bye to his father, Pandu and Champa. He boards the vehicle with Saraswati to leave his home for good, when Laxmi begs him not to leave. To prove her remorse she rips up the papers and tells him that all she wants is nothing more than \"her son\". The family is happily reconciled."

        "content": "\"Too Short a Season\" is the sixteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It first aired on February 8, 1988, in broadcast syndication. The teleplay was written by Michael Michaelian and D. C. Fontana, based on a story by Michaelian, and the episode was directed by Rob Bowman. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise transports the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson to deal with a hostage negotiation on the planet Mordan IV. Jameson took a drug to reverse his aging, and must defuse the situation with a former adversary. During re-writes of the script by Fontana, various elements introduced by Michaelian were changed, including the ending. Guest stars included Michael Pataki, who had appeared in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\". Reviews were mixed, with particular criticism directed at the acting of Clayton Rohner as Admiral Jameson."

        "content": "The Federation starship Enterprise, under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), brings aboard the elderly 85 year old Admiral Mark Jameson and his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt) on request of Karnas (Michael Pataki), the Governor of Mordan IV. Karnas warns that a dissident terrorist group has taken a Federation Ambassador and his staff hostage, and demand to speak to a negotiator. Jameson had negotiated a previous settlement on Mordan IV. As the ship travels to Mordan IV, Jameson becomes stronger and more able to move about on his own, and no longer shows signs of the terminal Iverson's Disease he was known to have before he was beamed aboard. Jameson admits to taking an array of drugs to reverse the aging process over the last two years, and only recently has taken an overdose of the drugs to prepare himself for the negotiations. Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains as a result of the overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson appears as a young adult. As they approach the planet, Jameson begins audio communication with Karnas to learn more of the situation, and asks Karnas if his old enemies had taken the hostages. Karnas replies they are dead, and that Jameson is coming back to the Mordan IV just like he did 45 years before. Jameson realizes that Karnas has never forgiven him and that it is Karnas himself that has taken the Federation staff. Karnas reminds Jameson that his treachery during their last encounter on Mordan IV resulted in years of war. Against the advice of Picard, Jameson devises plans to rescue the hostages by transporting the away team to the tunnels beneath Karnas' mansion, where Jameson believes the hostages are being held [the same place the previous hostages had been held]. Picard privately confronts Jameson about Karnas' motives. Jameson reveals that in the past, Karnas captured a Federation starliner in revenge for the death of his father by another local tribe. Jameson was sent in to bargain for their release after two previous Federation negotiators had been killed; Jameson reveals the truth to Picard: he did negotiate for the passengers' release -not by his golden oratory but by giving Karnas what he demanded, a supply of Federation weapons. However, Jameson, in his interpretation of the Prime Directive, also supplied the warring tribes with an equal number of weapons. Jameson had thought this would only lead to a short-lived skirmish, and had not expected a war that would last over forty years. Jameson is now insistent on correcting his past mistake and thus took the reverse aging drug in order to be at his best. In orbit, the Enterprise crew and Jameson beam down into the tunnels beneath Karnas' manor, but find that their arrival was anticipated and face off against armed guards. Jameson collapses during the fight, and the crew beams back to the Enterprise. Jameson was not shot, but the reverse aging drug is literally destroying his body. Karnas demands to see Jameson or he will kill a hostage every 15 minutes. Picard opts to beam himself, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Jameson, and eventually Jameson's wife Anne directly to Karnas' office. Karnas refuses to believe that the young man is Jameson, so Jameson reveals a scar on his wrist inflicted by Karnas years ago to seal their bargain. Jameson dies shortly afterward in his wife's embrace. Karnas agrees to let the hostages go, and to allow Jameson to be buried on Mordan IV at Anne's request."

        "content": "Writer Michael Michaelian originally pitched a story idea based on andropause, sometimes referred to as \"male menopause\". He wrote a treatment and first draft script involving reverse aging. D. C. Fontana later explained that the terrorist MacGuffin (an ambiguous but central plot point) was not quite right. Fontana was brought in to overhaul the ending, and explained that a \"lot of what I put in at the end was also in Michael's story and drafts, but approached with a different emphasis\". One significant alteration she made was to change the plot from involving actual terrorists to a trap that the crew must defuse. The original ending also had the two opposing parties on the planet sit down for peace talks with Jameson surviving the effects of the de-aging drugs. He would have been reduced in age to fourteen and could no longer remember his wife. Clayton Rohner was cast as Admiral Mark Jameson. Prior to filming, Rohner and director Rob Bowman worked together on weekends on the characterisation of Jameson. Bowman criticized the style of the script, describing it as \"sit-and-tell\". He also had a variety of problems with the wheelchair used in this episode which cost $10,000 to construct. It was referred to by prop designer Joe Longo as the \"big albatross\", and when a wheelchair was required for the Deep Space Nine episode \"Melora\" they instead created a much simpler version. Karnas was played by Michael Pataki, who had previously portrayed the Klingon Korax in The Original Series episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\". Make-up supervisor Michael Westmore had previously used makeup to age DeForest Kelley in the season premiere \"Encounter at Farpoint\", but \"Too Short a Season\" proved a unique challenge as four stages of make-up were required to show Admiral Jameson de-aging. The initial stage to show Jameson at his oldest, involved Rohner wearing a bald-cap and wig plus latex prosthetics applied to his eyes, forehead, throat and jowls. That stage took up to four hours to apply to the actor. Westmore found himself worn out by the volume of work during this episode, as at the time the make-up team on the series included just him and Werner Keppler. On the second day of shooting the first stage make-up, Westmore arrived after Rohner had been in make-up for three hours only to find that he was only half finished. Keppler and Westmore rushed to get him so as not to delay the filming of the episode. Bowman later criticised the make-up used on Rohner, describing it as sub-par. Westmore said that \"if I was working on a film, and had several months to test Clayton's make-up beforehand, it probably would have turned out more to my liking. With less than a week to work with, I don't think it turned out too badly.\" \"Too Short a Season\" marked the last time a cityscape would be built as a model for the show until the sixth-season episode \"Birthright\". They were instead replaced with matte paintings (one was reused from the comedy Spaceballs). Phasers from The Original Series and movies, along with a staff from \"The Last Outpost\" were used to decorate Karnas' office."

        "content": "The film begans in 1819 as Prince Keoki Kanakoa appeals to the Yale Divinity School to bring Christianity to the Islands of Hawaii. Newly ordained minister Reverend Abner Hale is among those who volunteer, but missionaries must be married. Abner, zealously devoted to his religious studies, was raised in a strict Calvinist household, and believes romance and pleasure are sinful. As Abner lacks marriage prospects, Reverend Dr. Thorn introduces him to his young niece, Jerusha Bromley, a beautiful and pious New England girl. Jerusha is in love with Captain Rafer Hoxworth, a whaler away at sea who has apparently forgotten her. When a packet of Hoxworth's delayed letters arrive, Dr. Thorn intercepts and conceals them. Abner is stunned by Jerusha's beauty. He is socially awkward and makes endless gaffes. Despite this, Jerusha encourages and accepts his proposal. Abner and Jerusha marry, and, along with other missionaries and Keoki, depart for Hawaii, enduring a harrowing ocean voyage of seasickness and treacherous conditions successfully transiting the Strait of Magellan. Abner has difficulty with marriage, believing love and passion are sinful. The ship arrives in Lahaina, Maui, where Keoki is reunited with his parents and sister. The missionaries are shocked by what is considered the islanders' sinful ways. Half-naked girls freely have sex with sailors and the natives worship Hawaiian gods. Keoki's father, Kelolo, is both the husband and biological brother of Keoki's mother Malama Kanakoa, the Ali\u02bbi Nui (ruler) whom the natives consider a \"sacred person\". Incest is believed to maintain a pure royal bloodline, and Keoki is expected to marry his sister, Noelani, who will one day become Ali'i Nui. However, Keoki, waiting to be ordained a Christian minister, rejects this, creating discord within his family. Abner and Jerusha remain in Lahaina while the other missionaries continue on to Honolulu. Before learning about Christianity, Malama demands Jerusha teach her to write English to communicate with the outside world. The Hales live in a grass hut and work to build a church. Jerusha helps the natives and tries to end disfigured or deformed infants being drowned after rescuing an infant with a facial birthmark. After a difficult labor, Jerusha, aided by Abner, gives birth to her first child, a son named Micah. Afterwards, Abner, emotionally moved over the birth, professes his great love to Jerusha. He later recants somewhat, believing it sinful to love anyone as much as God. Abner baptizes his first convert, a young Hawaiian girl named Iliki who was given to the Hales as a servant. Malama agrees to learn about Christianity, but resists being converted because she would have to send away Kelolo. At the Hales' urging, Malama enacts a curfew for sailors and forbids them fraternizing with island girls. The sailors riot in protest, led by Captain Hoxworth, who has made a stop on his long whaling voyage. In the midst of the melee, Hoxworth discovers Jerusha is in Lahaina and married to Reverend Hale, whom he already despises for inspiring Malama to impose the restrictions. The sailors partially torch the church, but the Hawaiians help save it, then chase the sailors back to their ships. As retaliation against Abner for marrying Jerusha, Hoxworth entices Iliki to leave the island with him. He tosses Abner overboard when he tries to retrieve her. Abner is attacked by a shark in the sea, leaving him permanently lame. Malama, on her deathbed, agrees to be baptized a Christian and renounce Kelolo as her husband. As the natives foretold, upon an Ali'i Nui's death a strong gale blows. It destroys the church which Abner refused to build as the villagers had dictated to protect it from strong winds. Keoki disavows Christianity and returns to his native religion after Abner reveals that he will never be ordained because he is not white. The church used Keoki to exploit the islands and its people. Noelani becomes the new Ali'i Nui. Abner discovers Keoki and Noelani have married and that Malama only became a Christian for her peoples' own good as more white settlers arrive. Although she was buried in the Christian graveyard, her family later moved her bones to a secret location to be with the old gods. Kelolo sails to Bora Bora, the land of their ancestors, to take Malama's heart there. An enraged Abner condemns their actions, saying God will punish all natives. Noelani and Keoki's baby is born horribly deformed. Abner refuses Jerusha's plea to save the infant, believing it is God's punishment. Keoki drowns the child. A measles outbreak decimates the native population who lack resistance to common diseases, killing hundreds, including Keoki, who dies renouncing God. Years of overworking in the hot climate and childbearing have weakened Jerusha, resulting in her early death. After losing Jerusha, Abner becomes more loving and protective of the Hawaiians. He joins them to curtail white settlers and plantation owners from taking more land. When the other ministers vote to own and profit from the land, Abner opposes them, and he is reassigned to a parish in Connecticut. He refuses to leave Hawaii, threatening to preach in the street without church support. He sends his three children to the Bromley family in New England. Returning to his hut, Abner finds a young Hawaiian man waiting there who wishes to be his assistant. The aging and frail Abner is overjoyed upon realizing the young man is the disfigured baby that Jerusha saved from being drowned many years before."

Boyfriend, Derek (Ron Livingston) appears to be the fulfillment of all of her wishes, despite his reluctance to commit or discuss his past relationships. When Stacy brings home tapes of the show to study, Derek recognizes a guest, his ex, a French model Lulu (Josie Maran). He won't answer her questions about their relationship, and then Stacy confides in her co-workers Barb (Holly Hunter) and Ira (Kevin Sussman) about her worries. Inspired by Ira's pitch about using PalmPilots\u2014 the modern day \"little black book\"\u2014to investigate a lover's secrets, Barb and Ira encourage Stacy to use Derek's to learn more about him. Under the guise of possibly inviting Lulu back to the Kippie Kann Show, Stacy, Barb, and Ira question her about Derek. Lulu stole Derek away from his then-serious girlfriend Joyce (Julianne Nicholson) and that their relationship was purely sexual. Back at her apartment, Stacy becomes increasingly insecure, listening to answering machine messages for Derek, looking through his box of mementos from former girlfriends and finally his Palm Pilot. She finds pictures of two of his exes on it, Joyce and Rachel (Rashida Jones). Stacy makes a doctor's appointment to meet Rachel, whom she believes is a podiatrist. Stacy discovers that Rachel is actually a gynecologist, and notices that Rachel has pictures of Derek's dog, Bob, in her office. Pretending it's research for the show, Stacy interviews Rachel, who reveals that she and Derek share custody of Bob and still see each other once in a while. Next, Stacy meets Joyce, and the two strike up a friendship, although Stacy feels guilty for befriending Joyce under false pretenses. When Joyce gets a call from Derek, she asks Joyce about them. Joyce admits to Stacy that she still hopes that she and Derek will reunite. Stacy panics and shows Joyce the interview with Lulu where she brags how Derek only went back to Joyce because Lulu became bored with him. Devastated, Joyce ends her friendship with Derek. Stacy feels guilty for making Joyce so unhappy and questions whether her investigation did anything to improve her own relationship with Derek. At the Kippie Kann Show, production prepares for the live show and Stacy is given lead responsibilities. She is thrust on stage, discovering that her investigations into Derek's past are the subject matter. Barb orchestrated the episode and invited Lulu, Rachel, Joyce, and Derek to the show.

The film was originally intended to be an adaptation of Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the Bee, but the rights could not be attained, or more rightly, Paramount was unwilling to purchase them from Samuel Goldwyn. Instead, they fashioned and crafted an original modern story loosely inspired on the book. The film was produced by Max Fleischer and directed by Dave Fleischer. It featured the songs \"We're the Couple in the Castle\", \"Katy Did, Katy Didn't\", \"I'll Dance at Your Wedding (Honey Dear)\" by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, and \"Boy Oh Boy\" by Sammy Timberg and Loesser. This would also be Paramount's last animated feature film until Charlotte's Web in 1973."

He finds that all is not as he left it, and his insect friends,who live in the \"Lowlands\" just outside of the garden of a cute bungalow belonging to down-on-his-luck songwriter Dick Dickens and his wife Mary, are now under threat from the \"human ones,\" who are trampling through the broken-down fence, using it as a shortcut. Insect houses are being flattened and burned by cast away cigar butts. Old Mr. Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity's sweetheart) are in grave danger of losing their Honey Shop to this threat. To compound their problems, devious insect \"property magnate\" C. Bagley Beetle has romantic designs on Honey Bee himself, and, with the help of his henchmen Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito, hatches plans to make Honey marry him or eliminate Hoppity as a romantic rival. Hoppity discovers that the songwriter and his wife are waiting for a \"check thing\" from the Famous Music publishing company for the songwriter's composition, \"We're the Couple in the Castle.\" With this money they can repair the fence, saving the bug community. But C. Bagley Beetle and his henchmen intercept and hide the check, and the Dickens house is foreclosed. Days pass, and with nothing improved, nearly everyone in the lowlands loses faith in Hoppity's claim. Mr. Beetle discovers that a skyscraper will be built on the site, destroying both the Lowlands and his own property. He schemes to \"gift\" the other bugs his soon-to-be worthless property on the condition that Honey marry him. When he realizes that Hoppity was nearby and overheard him, he seals Hoppity inside the envelope that the Dickens' check came in, hiding it in a crack in a wall. Construction begins while everyone is at the wedding of Beetle and Honey; a weight from a surveyor's level that rips through the chapel causes the terrified bugs to flee back to the Lowlands, not realizing that their own homes are endangered by the construction crew. Hoppity escapes when the construction crew demolishes the wall, freeing the envelope. Hoppity comes to Honey's rescue, battles Beetle and his henchmen, and wins. Hoppity tells everyone what happened and manages to get the check to Mr. Dickens. \"We're the Couple in the Castle\" becomes a massive hit.  Meanwhile, Hoppity leads an exodus from the Lowlands to the top of the skyscraper, where he believes the Dickens' have built a new home and invited the bugs to live there. They get to the top, which at first appears to be barren, but the young bugs discover the Dickens have built a new penthouse with a \"Garden of Paradise\" just as Hoppity had described. Honey and the rest of the Lowlanders live there happily ever after in their new home. And as Ambrose looks over the edge, he remarks, \"Look at all the human ones down there.  They look just like a lot of little bugs!\""

        "content": "Fleischer Studios' first feature, Gulliver's Travels, did such impressive business in its first week that Paramount president Barney Balaban ordered another feature for a Christmas 1941 release. Mr. Bug Goes to Town is similar in concept to Gulliver\u2019s Travels with its large cast of characters, complicated crowd scenes, and the contrasting scale of tiny characters against the gigantic human world. In Mr. Bug, the environment is central to the picture. While the lead characters, Hoppity the grasshopper and Honey Bee, do not lead the story as clearly as Disney characters do, it is the situation that propels the plot combined with colorful supporting comical characters. Mr. Bug Goes to Town was beset by problems due to the rift between Max and Dave Fleischer that began during the production of Gulliver's Travels.  From that point on, they communicated with each other via internal memos while working in the same building. Running a major animated cartoon studio solely by written communique turned out to be \"a sort of tragicomedy.\" Paramount was acutely aware of the problems between the Fleischer brothers and structured their contract for the completion of Mr. Bug in an unusual way, allowing for the resignation of either brother following its completion. When Paramount renewed the Fleischer contract on May 24, 1941, a clause stipulated that the brothers deliver signed letters of resignation to Paramount to be used at the studio's discretion. Post-production concluded in Hollywood just before Thanksgiving, and Dave tendered his resignation one month before the scheduled release. Mr. Bug Goes to Town was the first animated feature to give screen credit to the voice actors. The voices were provided by actor Stan Freed (Hoppity) and Pauline Loth (Honey). The supporting characters were voiced by members of the studio staff including Jack Mercer, the voice of Popeye (Mr. Bumble, Swat the Fly), and storymen Tedd Pierce (C. Bagley Beetle), Carl Meyer (Smack the Mosquito), Pinto Colvig (Mr. Creeper), Margie Hines (Mrs. Ladybug), and Mae Questel (Buzz the Beescout). Singer Kenny Gardner and actress Gwen Williams portrayed \"The Human Ones,\" Songwriter Dick Dickens and his wife, Mary."

It stars Goldie Hawn, Ben Johnson, William Atherton, and Michael Sacks. The film follows a husband and wife trying to outrun the law and was based on a real-life incident. In the film, a woman and her husband take a police officer hostage and flee across Texas as they try to get to their child before he is placed in foster care. The event partially took place, the story is partially set, and the film was partially filmed in Sugar Land, Texas. Other scenes for the film were filmed in San Antonio, Live Oak, Floresville, Pleasanton, Converse and Del Rio, Texas. The Sugarland Express marks the first collaboration between Spielberg and composer John Williams. Williams has scored all but five of Spielberg-directed films since (Twilight Zone: The Movie, The Color Purple, Bridge of Spies, Ready Player One and West Side Story being the only exceptions); this is the only score he has composed for Spielberg that has never been released as an album, although Williams re-recorded the main theme with Toots Thielemans and the Boston Pops Orchestra for 1991's The Spielberg/Williams Collaboration. The film is now regarded as something of an anomaly for both comic actress Hawn and blockbuster director Spielberg as neither has typically been associated with the crime drama genre."

When the car crashes, the two felons overpower and kidnap Slide, holding him hostage at the head of a slow-moving and growing caravan, initially of police cars but eventually including news vans, private citizens' vehicles, and helicopters. The Poplins and Slide travel through Beaumont, Dayton, Houston, Cleveland, Conroe and finally Wheelock, Texas. By holding Slide hostage, the pair are able to continually gas up their car, as well as get food via the drive-through.

It was originally broadcast on July 17, 1989, in broadcast syndication. It was the only clip show filmed during the series and was created due to a lack of funds left over from other episodes during the season. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) undergoes medical treatment by Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) for an alien infection and must relive numerous past events. It was the final episode written by Maurice Hurley, who originated the idea and wrote the first draft of the script, with Hans Beimler and Richard Manning conducting re-writes. It was directed by Rob Bowman and the framework sequences were filmed over the course of three days. It was watched by 9.8 million viewers on the first broadcast, the highest ratings for the series since \"Samaritan Snare\" two months earlier. \"Shades of Gray\" is widely regarded as the worst episode of the series, with critics calling it \"god-awful\" and a \"travesty\"; even Hurley referred to it negatively. It was the last appearance of Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur). It is also the final episode to regularly feature the original Type A TNG Starfleet uniforms, which were introduced in Season 1."

The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as his first meeting with Lieutenant Commander Data. He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick from 11001001). However, while pleasing to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds on the positive endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi therefore agree to try to make the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child. This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus, the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn, and the Klingon officer Klag on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers."

The only guest star was Colm Meaney as recurring character Chief Miles O'Brien. The reason was that the show had overspent on the episodes \"Elementary, Dear Data\" and \"Q Who\", and Paramount Pictures was holding the series to their overall season budget. It was the last episode on which Maurice Hurley acted as head writer; he referred to the episode as a \"piece of shit\" and \"terrible, just terrible\". He turned in the idea of a cheap clip show to save money and wrote the first draft of the script, with Richard Manning and Hans Beimler conducting re-writes. Director Rob Bowman initially thought that the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and never saw a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips that went into the episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach. Ron Jones created the music for the episode, including a three note motif to represent the virus which infects Riker. Themes build as the episode progresses, with elements from \"Infection Spreads\" which is played over the scene between Riker and Troi move into the pieces \"Shades of Pleasure\" and \"Earth Boys Are Easy\" which is played over the pleasurable memories. String instruments and flutes are added to \"Shades of Sadness\" which played over the unhappy memories, before it built to a climax in the intense memories in the pieces \"Critical Condition\", \"Shades of Conflict\" and \"Final Intensities\". Several scenes retained the compositions from the episodes, including pieces by Dennis McCarthy, while others by McCarthy were re-composed by Jones."

        "content": "The play takes place in what seems to be the present or the near future, in an unnamed Western country that is undergoing political conflict similar to what occurred in many Latin American countries during the Cold War: a ruling oligarchy with fascist tendencies, threatened by a communist guerrilla movement based in the lower class, is imprisoning and executing anyone suspected of subversion, including writers and intellectuals who have no direct connection to the guerrillas. One of the latter is Howard, a respected poet who wrote political essays in his youth; his daughter Judy and her husband Jack are also at risk of becoming suspects by association. Jack, an embittered English professor, is the play's chief narrator. He is generally uninterested in politics, but is somewhat sympathetic toward the government's murderous acts, for two reasons: he secretly resents Howard as a representative of \"highbrow\" culture, and he fears that his middle-class world would be wiped out if the rebels succeeded. As political repression worsens, Jack withdraws from his family and from reality. Howard is killed due to an arbitrary decision by the government, Judy is arrested and subsequently executed for unclear reasons, and Jack, after recovering from his nervous breakdown, is left as the sole survivor of Howard's literary circle. There is no visible action in the play or the film; the three characters describe their memories in separate fragments of monologue (as in Samuel Beckett's Play), with brief scenes of dialogue between them. Though the play is generally more realistic than Shawn's previous politically charged work The Fever, it focuses on the characters' emotional lives and leaves the civil war in the background. As a result, many reviewers of the play and film have been unclear as to whether the assassinated characters were killed by the government, for sympathizing with the rebels, or (as Jack fears) by the rebels, for being privileged academics. A close reading of the play suggests that the rebels (if they even exist) have not gained power and that what has occurred is a purge by one faction of the regime. Writing in Time Out New York about the conclusion to the film, Andrew Johnston (critic) stated: \"The film's final scene, in which Jack has an epiphany that inverts the one experienced by Winston Smith at the end of 1984, is sublimely harrowing. Like all great political art, Mourner offers no easy answers; instead, it uses the bond between the audience and the characters to jerk us out of our apathy and remind us that it's always later than we think.\""

He is later exonerated by the police. After the end of the four day engagement, Deke's management is offered a one-man show in Freegate, Texas, outside of Dallas. Due to the terms of the contract, Tex fires Susan and the singing trio, leaving only Deke in the show. Before he has to begin his new tour, Deke drives Susan to her family's farm. Meanwhile, in another publicity move, Glenda convinces Tex to buy an Imperial against his life insurance for Deke, inventing a story to tell Deke that it was a gift from the widow of an oil magnate. Back on the farm, Deke and Susan talk, where she tells him about being fired, after which they are about to kiss, when they are interrupted by her parents, who ask him to sing the song he promised. After Deke sings \"Loving You\", a surprised Susan remarks that she never heard him sing that way; Deke admits that he never felt that way before. Glenda arrives at the farm with the Imperial, and urges him to leave with her for Freegate to do the show. On their way back, Deke confesses to Glenda that his real surname is Tompkins. Deciding to disclose his past, they drive to Allen City, to the Woodbine cemetery, where he shows her the Tomb of Deke Rivers. He explains that when the orphanage he lived in burned down eleven years earlier, he decided to bury his past, and took Rivers' name. Meanwhile, in Freegate, the concert is cancelled by the Mayor's office, after they received complaints from parents about Deke's music.  Glenda arranges a studio telecast of a concert from Freegate in order to gain publicity; this enables her to convince the town board to allow him to perform. Deke, unhappy, is considering leaving the entertainment business.  When Glenda finds out, she talks him into performing, after which they kiss. On the day of the telecast, Deke is shocked after learning that Tex was married to (and later divorced from) Glenda. Disillusioned, he drives off before the show.  When Glenda finds out about it from Tex, she goes after Deke, finding him after he was run off the road by crossing cattle. Glenda confesses everything to him: getting him fired and lying about the Imperial, after which she tears up their contract, before convincing him to return for the broadcast. While the concert is delayed, fans are filmed by local newscasters defending Deke's music. Eventually, an upset Susan arrives to reveal that Deke will not appear on the show. However, Deke does appear shortly after, declaring that he had \"something very important to say to somebody\", and starts the show by singing \"Loving You\".  As the song ends, Susan goes onstage with him, after which they meet Tex and Glenda backstage. Deke offers to let them both manage him, as he is offered a recording contract. Tex and Glenda reconcile; meanwhile, Deke and Susan kiss."

        "content": "Elvis Presley plays Deke Rivers (whose real name is Jimmy Tompkins), a deliveryman who is discovered by the manager of a band. The film is Presley's second motion picture following his debut in the 1956 film Love Me Tender and his first starring role. It also marked the beginning of his seven-film streak for Paramount produced by Hal Wallis. For the role, Presley dyed his hair black following his favorite actors: Tony Curtis and Rudolph Valentino. As the second of his 1956 three-movie deal with Paramount Pictures, Presley was paid US$150,000. Lizabeth Scott plays Glenda Markle, manager and love interest of bandleader \"Tex\" Warner. Known for her roles in the 1940s and early 1950s, Scott returned from retirement to co-star in the movie. Wendell Corey plays Walter \"Tex\" Warner, bandleader of the Rough Ridin' Cowboys and the roadshow that Deke joins and revitalizes. Corey was known for his appearances in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and Joseph Anthony's The Rainmaker. A decade earlier, he co-starred with Lizabeth Scott in 1947's Desert Fury and I Walk Alone. Dolores Hart plays Susan Jessup, a young singer who tours with Tex Warner's band and Deke's love interest. Cast in her first movie role, Hart was discovered by Wallis after he saw her in a production of Joan of Lorraine at Loyola University. He screen-tested Hart on January 16, 1957, and later signed her for US$250 a week. Then named Dolores Hicks, Wallis requested her to change her name to favor her acting career. She adopted Hart, after the maiden surname of a friend. The actress changed it legally to \"Dolores Hart\". A year after Loving You, Hart was cast as Presley's love interest in his 1958 black-and-white musical drama, King Creole. Ken Becker also occasionally billed as Kenny Becker or Kenneth Becker, plays Deke's rival, Wayne, who loses a fistfight with Deke. Becker played similar roles in three later Presley films, G.I. Blues (1960), Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962) and Roustabout (1964). Jana Lund plays Daisy Bricker, the object of Wayne's jealousy, who kisses Deke (Presley's first on-screen kiss). A year earlier, she appeared in another rock and roll film, 1956's Don't Knock the Rock. Following Loving You, she had roles in three other titles in the psychotronic film genre, 1958's High School Hellcats, Hot Car Girl and Frankenstein 1970."

To impress Jacqueline, Grampa takes her out dancing, but when he does, Mr. Burns steals her from him and breaks his heart. Burns declares that he is in love with Jacqueline, and they are going to get married, against Marge's interest. Meanwhile, Bart buys a $350 Itchy & Scratchy animation cel with one of Homer's credit cards, which turns out to be poor quality with only part of Scratchy's arm drawn. Bart tries to trade it to Comic Book Guy for money but is offered a telephone in the shape of Mary Worth instead. In order to pay Homer back, Bart blackmails Burns by threatening to ruin his suit before his date. On the day of the wedding, Grampa crashes Burns' and Jacqueline's wedding ceremony and asks that Jacqueline marry him instead. Partly due to Burns' behavior, especially when he threatens Bart after he accidentally drops the wedding rings, she decides not to marry either man. Deciding that Jacqueline's decision is good enough for him, Grampa grabs her and they run out of the church and onto on a bus, leaving Burns heartbroken.

        "content": "\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\" was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The episode was inspired by the fact that The Simpsons has many elderly characters, which the writers felt was unique for network television, so they sought to highlight those characters. Originally, the episode was supposed to be about Misery. One of the ideas was that Grampa would get injured on Mr. Burns's property and get stuck there, leading Grampa to think that Mr. Burns would kill him when he was discovered there. However, this idea was cut out in production because the script was over 85 pages long. The episode was recorded at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where the cast and crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was \"genuine hearty laughter at various points\" during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: \"At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements.\" Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the \"astounding versatility\" of the actors became clear; \"Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities.\" Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with \"gravelly voices\"."

Colby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), an American who is serving with the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt. Colby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the football team escape. Hatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp, travelling to Paris, and finding the Resistance; at first, the Resistance decides that the plan to help the football team escape is too risky, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Paris sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp. Hatch is indeed recaptured, and is put in solitary confinement. Because of this, the prisoners do not know if the intended escape has actually been planned with the underground, so Colby tells the Germans that he needs Hatch on the team because Hatch is the backup goalkeeper and the starting goalkeeper has broken his arm. Colby actually has to break the existing goalkeeper's arm because the Germans want proof of his injury before they will agree to let Hatch onto the team. In the end, the POWs can leave the German camp only to play the match; they are to be imprisoned again following the match. The resistance's tunnellers break through to the showers in the dressing room at halftime, in an escape Hatch leads. But the rest of the team (led by Russell Osman saying \"but we can win this\") persuade him to continue the game, despite being behind 4\u20131 at halftime. Despite the match officials being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a draw is achieved after great performances from Luis Fernandez (portrayed by Pel\u00e9), Carlos Rey (portrayed by Osvaldo Ardiles) and Terry Brady (portrayed by Bobby Moore). Hatch plays goalkeeper, and makes excellent saves including one last save from a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win, drawing the game 4\u20134. An Allied goal had been blatantly disallowed earlier in the match, so the POW team should have won 5\u20134. After Hatch preserves the draw, the crowd storms the field and swarms the players.  In the chaos, some of the spectators help the Allied players disguise themselves so they can escape, and they all burst through the gates to freedom."

In his grief, John leaves New York, and moves to Seattle, Washington. He soon views and rents a mansion from an agent of the local historic society, Claire Norman, who tells him that the property has been vacant for twelve years. Not long after moving in, John begins to experience unexplained phenomena, starting with a loud banging every morning. One night, he discovers all of the water taps turned on and sees the apparition of a drowned boy in a bathtub. Soon after a red stained glass window pane shatters as he is outside and, upon investigation, he finds a locked, boarded up door in a closet leading to a hidden attic bedroom. John takes a music box from the mantle and discovers it plays the exact piano tune he has just recorded downstairs. John and Claire investigate the history of the house, believing that the ghost is that of a young girl killed outside the house in a traffic accident in 1909. John holds a seance and overhears the voice of the spirit on audio equipment, calling himself Joseph Carmichael. John discovers that Joseph Carmichael was a crippled and sickly six-year-old who was murdered in 1906 by his father Richard because he was unlikely to reach the age of 21, upon which he would have inherited an enormous fortune from his late grandfather. To ensure the inheritance, Richard replaced the dead boy with one procured from a local orphanage and spirited him away to Europe under the pretense of seeking treatment for his condition. After years away, he returned with the boy when he was 18, claiming that he was cured. The boy is now an old man, a prominent U.S. Senator who is also a major patron of the historical society that owns the house where his adoptive father committed the murder. John's investigation leads him to a property built on land that was once owned by the Carmichael family, where he believes the body of the murdered boy, the real Joseph Carmichael, was dumped in a well. There, he finds the skeleton of a young child with his christening medal. John attempts to speak to Senator Carmichael but is restrained. The Senator is disturbed to see the medal, as it is identical to the one in his possession given to him by his adoptive father. The society cancels John's lease on the house and fires Claire. Senator Carmichael sends a detective, DeWitt, to John's home in an attempt to intimidate him and retrieve the medal. John refuses, and when DeWitt leaves to obtain a search warrant, his vehicle mysteriously crashes, killing him. After DeWitt's death, Senator Carmichael agrees to meet with John; John tells him the story. Carmichael angrily berates John for accusing his adoptive father of murder. John leaves the skeleton's christening medal, along with the only copy of the seance recording, and apologizes. Claire goes to the house to find John and is chased by Joseph's wheelchair until she falls down the stairs. When John arrives the house begins to shake. He tries to appease Joseph's ghost but falls from the second floor as Joseph's ghost sets the house on fire. Simultaneously, Senator Carmichael compares the two medals, and, realizing the truth, he falls into a trance staring at the portrait of his adoptive father. John witnesses the Senator's astral body climbing the burning stairs to Joseph's room. Claire rescues John while Carmichael witnesses the murder of the boy Joseph and suffers a fatal heart attack. John and Claire see the Senator's body being loaded into the ambulance. The next morning, Joseph's burnt wheelchair sits amid the ruins of the mansion and his music box begins playing a lullaby. The abused house has been avenged by the changeling boy."

Vicki and Bennett live in fear of Koquillion (Barrett), a bipedal inhabitant of Dido, who is stalking the area. Koquillion encounters the time travellers and attacks, pushing Barbara over a cliff and temporarily trapping Ian and the Doctor. Vicki finds Barbara injured and rescues her from Koquillion, and they share reminiscences. Vicki's father was among those who died when the survivors of the crash, save Bennett and Vicki, were lured to their deaths by the natives of Dido. She is evidently very lonely, having befriended an indigenous Sand Beast (Tom Sheridan) for company. However, when Ian and the Doctor reach the ship, tempers are fraught because Barbara mistook the Sand Beast for a threat and killed it. The Doctor enters Bennett's room, and finds things are not as they seem. The supposedly crippled Bennett is missing, and a tape recorder hides his absence. He finds a trap door in the floor of the cabin and follows it to a temple carved from rock where he unmasks Koquillion as Bennett. Bennett reveals he killed a crewmember on board the ship and was arrested, but the ship crashed before the crime could be radioed to Earth. It was he who killed the crash survivors and the natives of Dido to cover his crime. He has been using the Koquillion alias so that Vicki would back up his story, and had hoped the planet would be destroyed when his version of events was given. Just as Bennett is about to kill the Doctor, two surviving native Didonians arrive and force Bennett to his death over a ledge. They then stop the signal to prevent the Rescue Ship reaching their planet. With no living family and nothing left for her on Dido, Vicki is welcomed aboard the TARDIS."

Producer Verity Lambert had originally booked Pamela Franklin to portray Jenny (originally called Saida) in the previous serial, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, and continue as Susan's replacement; however, Lambert soon changed her mind, and outgoing script editor David Whitaker was commissioned to write a two-part serial to introduce Vicki. Whitaker was officially commissioned on 1 November 1964, the day after his script editor contract with the BBC had expired. The Rescue was the first story under new script editor Dennis Spooner, though he was not credited. Earlier names given to Vicki were Valerie, Lukki, and Millie; the latter was inspired by Millie Small, but the name was considered too similar to comedian Millicent Martin. The draft script for the serial was titled Doctor Who and Tanni, referring to another name considered for Vicki. The Rescue used the same production team as the following serial, The Romans, and the two were formed to create a single six-episode production block. Christopher Barry was selected to direct the two serials; he was unimpressed with the scripts for The Rescue. With budgeting tight, Barry decided to reuse the score from his previous serial, The Daleks, composed by Tristram Cary. Cary was initially hesitant, having had negative experiences with the reuse of his music in the past. Music from the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh episodes of The Daleks were used in The Rescue; the sound of a Dalek death was reused for the death of Sandy the sand beast in the second episode."

        "content": "Shy, ordinary, and glasses wearing Wu Fang (Zhao Wei) is a graduate student at Beijing University who goes on a sequence of blind dates despite never successfully attracting a partner. She always orders a glass of green tea, and is perceptive, nuanced, and quietly pretty, though this goes unnoticed with the men who are often curt and uninterested, put off by her conservative clothing and awkward demeanor. In the entire movie, Wu Fang never talks about herself, choosing instead to only muse about a friend she has. On the next date, she meets Chen Minglian (Jiang Wen) and discusses how her friend is clairvoyant, and can read a stranger's fortune by swirling and observing their tea glass, to which Mingliang scoffs at. After more unappetizingconversation, Wu Fang slaps him after he makes a perverted suggestion and the two part ways. However Mingliang manages to find Fang in places around her school campus, first to her irritation, but after a more conversing she begins to warm up to him. Wu Fang is revealed to have a gentle humor. She also discloses that the one thing she hates is when men hit women. Through these conversations, the backstory of Fang's fortune-telling friend is revealed. She describes her friend as someone who can make even smoking cigarettes look graceful and beautiful, who changes boyfriends faster than the weather, and whose father is extremely terrifying, who she met on one occasion. Her friend's mother was a make-up artist at a morgue, a fact that she had kept secret from her husband until after they were married and daughter were born. Upon discovering the truth, he descended into alcoholism and violence. Over the course of several conversations, Wu Fang divulges further that he forced his wife to wear gloves at all times, even in sleep, claiming that they smelled of death. He would neurotically declare that his wife's hands (and synecdochically her profession) were destroying his life between drunk beatings to both her and his daughter. The story ends when one night the father attempted to rape her mother while she was cooking and the friend ended up accidentally piercing his throat on a potato peeler, which resulted in the father's death and mother's conviction of murder and imprisonment till this day. Fang laughs and adds that the story has been fictional the whole time. Mingliang grows equally entranced with both the story and Wu Fang, who does not reciprocate and has mysterious commitments at night. At the same time, Mingliang's artist friend Jun has been trying to set him up with a sultry piano player in a lounge who is known to date anyone but only once. The musician, Lang Lang (also Zhao Wei) bears a striking similarity to Wu Fang, but without glasses, and Mingliang is at first adamantly convinced that they are the same person. Lang Lang laughs it off and kisses him on the cheek. Still unconvinced by the uncanny resemblance between the two women, Mingliang snatches Wu Fang's glasses off her face, to which she overreacts and leaves. For a few days, Wu Fang disappears which gives Mingliang and Lang Lang time to date and converse, in which her obvious beauty, easy laugh, smoking habit, and graceful confidence with men distinguish her entirely from Wu Fang. Though Mingliang is charmed by her, his mind cannot help but think of Wu Fang, who comes back from her trip, only to disappear again. Lang Lang casually mentions that her father was a discontent \"one hit wonder\" composer who was violent at home. Mingliang asks her what her mother did for work, and she replies that she supervised a glove factory. When Jun plans a couples dinner party, and Wu Fang is still no where to be found. Mingliang finds Lang Lang and asks her to pose as Wu Fang for just the night.  There she performs a fortune telling via the leaves in her green tea. Insecure of Lang Lang's beauty and her boyfriend's obvious lust, Jun's girlfriend drunkenly attempts to flirt with Mingliang and incite drama with Lang Lang, which doesn't phase either, but results in Jun slapping her. Lang Lang approaches Jun and slaps him in return, stating that the thing she hates most is when men hit women. The film ends somewhat ambiguously. Mingliang and Lang Lang get a hotel room. A time lapse filmed with a camera underneath a translucent glass table plays out, where Mingliang and Wu Fang are above it talking, and her glasses are on the table next to a glass of green tea."

After Walter and Irene make plans to drive to Lake Tahoe, Irene feigns illness and asks Walter to instead give Torrence, who is pretending to be Irene's \"cousin\" from Illinois, a lift to Denver, allowing Torrence a chance to murder Walter en route. The plan falls apart when Williams survives a hit on the head from the would-be killer. Attempting to flee the scene in Williams' Packard convertible, Torrence dies in a fiery head-on collision with a gasoline tanker truck. The body of Torrence is mistakenly identified as Williams. In the meantime, Irene has made reservations at a hotel in Oakland for her and her boyfriend to meet afterward, under the assumed names of \"Mr. & Mrs. Jack Burns\". The wounded, dazed Williams falls asleep in the back of a moving van and ends up in the small town of Larkspur, Idaho. Using the name \"Bill Walker\", he gets a job as a service station mechanic and falls in love with Marsha Peters (Ella Raines), a young widow who is the station's owner. Meanwhile, the police arrest Williams' wife for his \"murder\". Williams eventually tells Marsha the truth, and she persuades him to go back to clear his wife, but when he does he is charged by the incompetent and naive police department with murdering Torrence. Marsha enlists the help of kindly police detective Quincy (Charles Coburn) to prove Walter's innocence. With the additional evidence of the housekeeper Su Lin (Anna May Wong) the key and hotel registration are found and Walter is freed. His wife is then held for conspiracy to murder."

Maximus does not think much of it, until he and Christine meet by chance on a train and he foresees an impending crash. He pulls the emergency cord to stop the train, but nobody believes him. He, his family and Christine disembark, and a few minutes later the train crashes. Christine tells her father, who owns a newspaper. He publishes the story, making Maximus famous. Maximus realizes that his power only works when Christine is near. As they spend more time together, Christine falls in love with him and Rene becomes jealous. Maximus' mother (Mary Clare) believes that no good can come of this new gift, but Maximus pays little attention, enjoying his well-paid success. Another of his well-publicized predictions comes true: a 100-to-1 long shot wins The Derby. He chooses to ignore his own prophecy of his mother's death; when it comes true, he is so distraught that he decides to follow her wishes and abandon his ability. He feels compelled to act, however, when he foresees a great mining disaster. He is unable to convince the mining company to evacuate the mine. When the disaster occurs, hundreds are killed and more are missing and presumed dead. He is publicly accused of causing the accident and is brought to trial. The prosecution claims that Maximus himself caused both tragedies, by delaying the train and by panicking the miners into making a mistake. Maximus predicts in the courtroom that the missing miners will be found alive. When this becomes true, he is released. Maximus decides to give up his gift and he and Rene slip away into obscurity."

Narrated by Samantha, the story focuses on the summer of 1970, when the girls, led by her twelve-year-old self (Gaby Hoffmann) sought to earn enough money to purchase a tree house to place in Chrissy's backyard in their affluent suburban neighborhood, the Gaslight Addition, and how they overcame major personal struggles, Samantha in her parents' divorce and her mother's subsequent dating, Teeny (Thora Birch) in her pursuit of stardom and good looks, Roberta (Christina Ricci) in overcoming her mother's death and the embarrassment she experiences due to her developing breasts, and Chrissy's (Ashleigh Aston Moore) naivety about sex and life in general due to her mother's overprotective nature. Also, the girls, motivated by Samantha's interest in the occult, regularly participate in seances. One night, the girls sneak out to the cemetery to perform a seance. A cracked tombstone convinces them they have resurrected the spirit of a young boy identified only as Dear Johnny, who died in 1945 at the age of 12. Intrigued, they search for information at the library but find nothing. Later, while heading for the library in a nearby town, the girls spy the Wormer brothers skinny-dipping in the lake. To retaliate for a prank they played on them, the girls steal their clothes, tossing them onto the road while riding off. At the library, Roberta discovers an article about her mother being killed in a car accident: she was hit head on, trapped in her car for an hour, and then later died of massive head trauma and internal bleeding\u2014facts previously unknown to her. Samantha finds an obituary that briefly mentions Dear Johnny and his mother tragically dying, but many of the pages are missing, leaving the cause of their deaths a mystery. While riding back to their town, the girls encounter a hitchhiking Vietnam veteran. They ask him questions about the war and his time there. He is predominantly evasive and tells them their parents aren't always right\u2014something that Samantha loudly agrees with. The girls then visit local psychic Wiladene, who determines Dear Johnny was murdered. On their way home, they meet up with local neighbourhood kids at a pick up game of softball. A local boy insults Roberta who begins fighting with him; after the fight is broken up, he insults her deceased mother and Samantha tackles him to begin fighting again. Samantha goes home and unexpectedly meets Bud Kent, a man her newly divorced mother invited to dinner for their first date. She is standoffish to Bud, who accidentally spills wine on his shirt; her mother gives him one of her ex-husband's old bowling shirts he had left behind. Upset, Samantha storms out and flees to Teeny's house where she is on the roof watching Love Story at the drive-in movie next door. They hang out in the tree house display at the store, where Samantha confesses her parents are getting a divorce. Teeny comforts her and breaks her favourite necklace in two, giving one half to her as a \"best friends for life\" bracelet. On their way home during a thunderstorm, Samantha drops her bracelet in a storm drain. When she climbs in to retrieve it, the water rises, trapping her. Crazy Pete, a local old man who only comes out at night to ride his bike, rescues her. He asks them why they're afraid of him, and after they tell him it's scary that he only comes out at night, he says he prefers not to be around people. Grateful for his actions, they now see him differently. At the same time, Roberta is playing basketball in her driveway when Scott Wormer suddenly arrives. They briefly play together, and question why they fight all the time before sharing a kiss. Later, adult Samantha notes that Roberta has stopped taping her breasts after this happened. The girls consult Samantha's grandmother about Dear Johnny's death. She declines to discuss the murders, saying it took her a long time to forget about that tragedy. After she leaves with friends to play bingo, the girls climb through a window into the attic where Samantha's grandfather had collected and saved old newspapers. They discover from an article that Jonathan Sims and his mother, Beverly Anne, were shot and killed when they interrupted a burglary; father and husband, Peter, came home to find their bodies. Roberta becomes upset and angry that two innocent people were killed and that her mother died violently, contrary to what she was told. Samantha announces that her parents are getting divorced, and the girls make a pact to always be there for one another. To put Dear Johnny's soul to rest, the girls go to the cemetery to perform another seance. His tombstone suddenly rises surrounded by bright light. A figure appears from behind, but it is only the groundskeeper who chastises them for \"playing\" in the cemetery and explains that the tombstone was damaged, is being replaced, and he was the one who cracked it. Realizing they never resurrected Dear Johnny, they agree to stop the seances. While leaving, they notice Crazy Pete, and Samantha follows him back to the tombstone. Realizing that he is Peter, she comforts him, while he advises her not to dwell on things. Some time after, the tree house is finally bought, and Samantha narrates, \"The treehouse was supposed to bring us more independence. But what the summer actually brought was independence from each other.\" The film returns to 1991, and Chrissy goes into labor and gives birth to a baby girl. Later, in their old tree house, Roberta reveals that Crazy Pete died the previous year and Samantha reveals that Pete was Dear Johnny's father which the other girls didn't know. They then discuss how happy they are in life and make another pact to visit more often."

As a girl, she tapes her breasts to flatten them, plays sports, and never hesitates to fight a boy. She usually leads the girls in their rivalry with the Wormer brothers, but eventually shares a kiss with Scott. Afterward, she no longer tapes her breasts, indicating that she accepts that she is growing into a woman. Her struggle to come to terms with her mother's death is highlighted in the film when she fakes her own death before her friends by pretending to have drowned while they were swimming, as well as in another instance in which Samantha recalls her having jumped off the roof and pretended to have broken her neck earlier that summer. As an adult, she is an obstetrician and lives with her boyfriend. At the end of the film, she delivers Chrissy's baby. Although it is never shown or mentioned who her boyfriend is the film hints that it might be Scott. Chrissy DeWitt (Ashleigh Aston Moore/Rita Wilson) was raised by an overbearing, fastidious mother (Bonnie Hunt) who sheltered her. Her naivete, particularly about all things sexual, is often laughed at by her friends. She is the \"good girl\", who chastises the others for cussing (as children and adults). Being the most responsible, she closely monitors the \"tree house money\" they are saving. She always questions the others' schemes, but is fiercely loyal to them.  As an adult, she marries the nerdy Morton Williams, and they live in her childhood home and later have a baby girl. The pending birth of her first child brings Samantha and Teeny back to their hometown. Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell (Thora Birch/Melanie Griffith) lives with her rich country club parents who are rarely around, which according to Samantha's narration is, \"a typical upbringing for actors and pathological liars\". She loves glamour, dressing up, and using makeup, and watches the films at the drive-in movie from her rooftop. Among the girls, she is the most interested in sexuality and boys and often flirts. She desires a bigger bust, and has breast implants when she's an adult. She is now a successful actress and has had multiple marriages. The limousine she arrives in is later used to transport Chrissy to the hospital when she goes into labor."

Recently separated, Whitlock is currently seeing local resident Ann Merai-Harrison, an old flame from high school whose husband Chris, a former professional quarterback seemingly oblivious to the relationship, abuses her. While attending Ann to the doctor, Matt finds out she has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Matt is also going through a divorce from his wife, homicide detective Alex, and confides in his friend, medical examiner Chae. Ann intends to reward Matt's loyalty to her by making him the sole beneficiary of her $1,000,000 life insurance policy. Matt suggests that she should travel to Switzerland to undergo a newly-developed, groundbreaking treatment. The problem is that Ann does not have any money. Desperate to help her, Matt takes $485,000 out of evidence and gives it to her so she can make the trip. When the money goes up in flames in a suspicious house fire that kills Ann and Chris, Matt is horrified to find their charred remains. Upon investigation, Matt discovers that the doctor that diagnosed Ann was an imposter, Ann didn\u2019t have cancer, and that he has been set up. When the Drug Enforcement Administration agents call the next day to get the evidence money in order to bust a higher drug lord, Matt responds erratically. He finds out that the money is now with the imposter doctor and that Alex is about to bust him. He rushes to the hotel and after a brief struggle, he accidentally kills the imposter, takes the money and flees. Although Matt is seen by the police, he is thought to have come to protect Alex. Later that evening, Alex finds that Matt is Ann's sole beneficiary and also that he has been in a relationship with her. At the same time, Matt receives a distress call from Ann, who is still alive, and unofficially goes to save her. Chris and Matt fight, Ann shoots and kills Chris. Then Ann reveals that she had planned all of this and shoots Matt in the leg. When Ann is about to kill Matt, Alex kills her; Alex traced Matt using a GPS tracker and asks him whether he planned to elope with the money but Matt reveals that he has not brought the money with him. When the irritated DEA agents come to arrest Matt as he had promised to deliver the money earlier that day, he says that his man was sent to Miami, and simultaneously Chae appears with the money, explaining about a wrong address and that he could not find the DEA office. So the DEA agents leave with the money and Matt has no charges on him. Later, when Matt is on medical leave, Chae visits him with news that Matt is the recipient of Ann\u2019s insurance policy. But Alex says that, \"as his wife,\" she knows that Matt has to reject it, meaning that she has decided to drop the divorce and move back in with Matt. Overjoyed, Matt seemingly forgets about the life insurance money, though Chae is amusingly adamant that Matt must take it."

        "content": "Cannibal Tours is a 1988 documentary film by Australian director and cinematographer Dennis O'Rourke.  While it borrows heavily from ethnographic modes of representation, the film is a biting commentary on the nature of modernity.  The film is also widely celebrated for its depiction of Western touristic desires and exploitation among a 'tribal' people. The film follows a number of affluent European and American tourists and ecotourists as they travel from village to village along the middle Sepik River in Papua New Guinea.  Most of the villages in the film are inhabited by the Iatmul people. The film shows the tourists driving hard bargains for local handcrafts such as woodcarvings and baskets, relentlessly taking photos of local people, handing out cigarettes, balloons, and perfume, viewing staged dance performances, and offering naive comments on native people living in harmony with nature.  The film, too, tacks between the tourists and black-and-white photographs from the era of German colonialism of New Guinea (1880s\u20131914).  With some prodding, the tourists unwittingly reveal an unattractive and pervasive ethnocentrism to O'Rourke's cameras.  The tourists thus become somewhat dehumanized by the filmmaker's camera even as they themselves dehumanize and exoticize even the most mundane aspects of Sepik River life. The title of the film can be read in at least a couple of ways.  At one point early in the film, a German tourist, clearly titillated, describes the bygone practice of raiding and cannibalism.  He is obsessed with cannibalism, asking local men about the former practice, and snapping photos of locations where local people once practiced headhunting; other tourists also attempt to discuss the \"symbolic\" meaning of cannibalism.  But the narrative plot of the film is to portray the tourists as the real cannibals who consume the world through their arrogance, acquisitiveness, primitivist fantasies of indigenous people, and photography (the cameras in the film double for the guns of past colonial administrators).  In short, the film presents the tourists as the people driven by truly bizarre beliefs and behaviors.  By contrast, the local people are represented as eminently practical and reasonable.  Thus the 'natives' display the rationale logic of modernity, while the Western tourists are guilty of the very irrational traits they attribute to the natives.  The climax of the film is when a group of tourists, faces painted in 'native fashion' by local men from one village (Tambunum), prance, dance, and assume a boxing stance to the music of Mozart.  The message is clearly: we have finally succeeded in our quest for the primitive, and he is us."

As they study it further, the zone expands and soon envelops the Enterprise, leaving them in a black void with sensors reporting complete nothingness outside. Picard orders the ship on a return course, but they find that they cannot escape; they leave a stationary beacon behind them, only to have it reappear ahead of them again. A Romulan Warbird suddenly decloaks in front of the ship and attacks, and Picard orders the crew to return fire; they destroy the Warbird, but Picard is suspicious of how easily this occurs. The crew then detect what appears to be their sister ship, the USS Yamato, approaching, but it does not respond to hails. Commander Riker and Lt. Worf beam over to search the ship, where they find it empty with various inconsistencies in its construction, including more seemingly impossible physical loops. The Enterprise then detects an exit from the darkness, but cannot lock onto the away team to retrieve them before the opening disappears. The Yamato begins to fade away, but the Enterprise is able to beam Riker and Worf back just in time. More openings appear in the blackness, each closing as soon as the Enterprise approaches them. Picard realizes that they are being manipulated, and orders a full stop. Suddenly, an entity with a distorted, almost childlike face as a result of it attempting to look humanoid, appears in the void, calling itself Nagilum. It announces its curiosity about humans and their \"limited existence\" and would like to test the limits of the human body. It causes Ensign Haskell to experience violent convulsions, and he then falls to the floor dead. Nagilum then states that it wants to know everything about death, asserting that it would take between a third and a half of the Enterprises crew to complete its experiments. Picard decides to activate the ship's self-destruct sequence rather than to submit to Nagilum's whims. As the crew prepares for their end, Picard is tested again by Nagilum through peculiar behavior displayed by doppelgangers of Counselor Troi and Lt. Commander Data, both of whom question the self-destruct order. After these facsimiles are gone and the countdown nears zero, the void suddenly vanishes, leaving the Enterprise in normal space. Picard orders the ship to move away at high speed, and when he is finally satisfied that they are truly free, cancels the self-destruct sequence. As the Enterprise continues on its mission, Picard is met by the face of Nagilum on his ready-room computer. Nagilum offers its evaluation of humanity, criticizing the species's faults and claiming they have nothing in common with its kind. Picard disagrees, pointing out that their recent encounter shows that both species are curious, a logical statement to which Nagilum concedes before disappearing."

The title of the episode is from the last stanza of a 1907 poem, \"The Spell of the Yukon\" by Robert W. Service. When Picard and Riker decide to set the ship on auto-destruct, the computer asks how long until that should happen (they choose 20 minutes), which is a direct contradiction \u2014 or development subsequent \u2014 to a first season episode (11001001) when the captain and first officer set the auto-destruct, and Riker comments that they have no choice as to the length of time until the ship destroys itself (5 minutes)."

        "content": "In a British Army \"glasshouse\" (military prison) in the Libyan desert, prisoners convicted of service offences such as insubordination, being drunk while on duty, going AWOL or petty theft are subjected to repetitive drill routines as a punishment in the blazing desert heat. The arrival of five new prisoners slowly leads to a clash with the camp authorities. One new NCO guard (Williams) who has also just arrived employs excessive punishments, which include forcing the five newcomers to repeatedly climb a man-made hill in the centre of the camp. When one dies, a power struggle erupts between brutal ex-civilian prison guard Staff Sergeant Williams (Ian Hendry), humane Staff Sergeant Harris (Ian Bannen), Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson (Harry Andrews), and the camp's medical officer (Michael Redgrave) as they struggle to run the camp in conflicting styles. Roberts (Sean Connery) is a former squadron sergeant major from the Royal Tank Regiment, convicted of assaulting his commanding officer \u2013 which he explains to his fellow inmates was because he was ordered to lead his men in a senseless suicidal attack. Roberts openly scorns Williams' brutality and serves as a challenge to his authority. Like Roberts, the RSM is a career soldier and commands authority within the prison in which he is working. However, he is realistic about his role stating, \"No one's going to pin a medal on us\". He sees his duty to be as important as any other \u2013 that of breaking down failed soldiers, then building them back up again, in his words, \"Into men!\" The other members of Roberts' group are McGrath, a hard Yorkshireman serving a sentence for drunkenness, fighting and assaulting members of the Military Police. Army office clerk Stevens, a timid and naive man jailed for going AWOL. Bartlett, a spiv who shirks active service and has been jailed for selling Army vehicle tyres to the Arabs, and the light-hearted King, a West Indian soldier serving a sentence for stealing three bottles of whisky from the sergeants' mess, and being drunk and disorderly. Staff Sergeant Williams' ambition is matched only by his cruel treatment of the prisoners; he seeks to use their suffering as a means for promotion. When Roberts is accused of cowardice, he asks Staff Sergeant Williams, \"And what are you supposed to be \u2013 a brave man in a permanent base job?\" The RSM also questions Staff Sergeant Williams's motives for getting out of London, as in another scene, he slyly mentions the fact that the Germans were bombing the UK (including the civilian prison Williams worked at) just as Williams was volunteering for prison duty in Africa. Staff Sergeant Williams openly admits that he is trying to impress the RSM by showing that he has got what it takes to do the job, and attempts to undermine the RSM with a late-night drinking contest. Staff Sergeant Harris is the conscience of the prison who sympathises with the men and really wants no part of his being there. The RSM believes that Harris is far too lenient. The officers, both the CO (Norman Bird) and the medical officer, take their duties casually and, as Roberts points out, \"everyone is doing time here, even the screws\" (prison officers). When the medical officer confronts the RSM with the claim that Stevens' punishment is too severe, the RSM turns this around and blames the MO as it was he who passed Stevens as \"fit for punishment\". Williams is a bully and a coward and singles out Bartlett and Stevens who are the two weakest members of the group, particularly Stevens. Stevens finally loses his mind and dies of heat exhaustion after repeated and unwarranted punishments by Williams, and the whole prison rises in protest. Roberts openly accuses Staff Sergeant Williams of murdering Stevens. King corroborates the story. However, this results in both being punished.  The RSM has the experience to deal with a potentially violent situation. Firstly by stating that the ring-leaders wil be charged with mutiny (an offence punishable by death). \"Who are the ring-leaders\" shouts one prisoner. The RSM relies with a stern \"Every fifth man!\". The RSM thus gaining control, eases the situation whereby the prisoners willingly break up the revolt. Meanwhile, with the help of two prison guard corporals, Staff Williams beats up Roberts in an empty solitary cell. Roberts suffers a broken foot and Harris gets him carried to see the medical officer. The RSM intervenes and orders Roberts to march despite his injury. King again protests, and after being subjected to racial abuse by the RSM refuses to wear the uniform or acknowledge any form of army discipline. The MO and Staff Sergeant Harris insist on reporting the abuses at the camp whilst the RSM and Williams join forces in an attempt to intimidate them into backing down. The injured Roberts is left alone in the cell and Williams remains behind. He then prepares to administer one final, perhaps fatal, beating to Roberts, when King and McGrath enter the cell, proceed to attack Williams, and are heard to severely beat him (off-camera). Roberts pleads with them to stop, knowing that if prisoners beat up a prison officer, any case they may have had against him is lost."

Red and Stumpy (Stuart Erwin), another grunt, teach Slim what he needs to know. Slim wins the respect of Red and Pop when he spots cheating during a poker game and pitches in during the ensuing brawl. When hungover lineman Wyatt Ranstead falls and is killed, Slim is promoted to lineman. The company sends a vice president to investigate the death. To save Pop's job, Red deliberately antagonizes the executive and is fired. Slim gets himself dismissed out of loyalty, and the two go on the road. They head to Chicago to see Red's girlfriend, Cally (Margaret Lindsay) a nurse. The three set out to have a good time (though Red insists on paying for everything). Slim finds himself falling for Cally, and she for him. When Red's money runs out, he and Slim head off to New Mexico for work. Red knows and dislikes one of their fellow linemen, Wilcox (Joe Sawyer). When Red is later offered the job of foreman at another camp, he initially turns it down, but changes his mind when Slim offers to be his \"straw boss\" (assistant).   Wilcox, who had been hoping for the promotion himself, tries to sabotage Red's rope, but Slim stops him. Later, on the ground, Wilcox pulls out a knife and stabs Slim. While Slim is recovering in the hospital, Cally comes to nurse him. They admit they love each other and tell Red they are going to get married. When Slim is offered stable, safe maintenance work, Cally accepts for him. Slim, however, refuses to give up his dangerous profession, and when Pop sends for Red, goes with him. They arrive during a terrible blizzard, and are called out to a substation to restore power, even though there are \"hot\" wires all around. Red and another man fall to their deaths when a rope breaks in a block and tackle while pulling up a transmission line. Cally joins Slim and once again tries to talk him out of line work. When Slim heads back out into the snow to complete the job, Cally accepts his decision, telling him, \"I'll be waiting for you.\""

In the diner, Buffy serves Lily and Rickie, a young couple living on the streets, who have just gotten a complementary set of distinctive tattoos. As Buffy walks the street a homeless woman is muttering she is no-one. Later that evening Lily approaches Buffy and reveals that she remembers her from Sunnydale and a time when Lily was known as \"Chanterelle\". As they talk, a man bumps through and mutters that he is no-one as he walks out into traffic and is nearly hit by a car, only saved by Buffy's quick response. Buffy encounters a man named Ken, who comments on her \"lost\" state and offers to befriend her. The next day Lily tells Buffy that Rickie has disappeared. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help find him. In her search, she finds the body of an elderly homeless man with Rickie's tattoo. Buffy reports her findings to Lily, who does not believe that the body could be Rickie's. On the street Lily meets Ken, who claims to know Rickie, so she eagerly goes with him. Buffy interrogates a blood bank worker who has been acting suspiciously, and learns that the woman has been giving Ken the names of healthy homeless people who come in to donate blood. Back in Sunnydale, Willow, Xander and Oz struggle to cover for Buffy in her Slayer duties, and reluctantly resort to using Cordelia as bait in their next stakeout mission. After returning from an unsuccessful lead on Buffy's location in Oakland, Giles visits Joyce, who is now suffering from agoraphobia after learning of Buffy's Slayer life. Joyce blames Giles for taking her daughter away from her. Meanwhile, Ken has prepared a hesitant Lily for a \"cleansing\", which entails stepping into a bath of black oil in the floor. At the door, Buffy attempts to pass herself off as a sinner wanting a new chance, but ends up kicking her way into the building in time to see Lily dragged into the pool. Buffy and Ken wrestle and they both fall in, coming out below in a huge factory. Ken's human mask falls off, revealing him to be a demon. Buffy and Lily are now amongst many other slave laborers of varying ages. Ken tells Buffy and Lily that they are in a hell dimension where time passes very quickly: a hundred years there equals only one day in Los Angeles. Since he only picks people who no one will miss, they will have worked themselves to a used-up death of old age without anyone noticing their absence. He tells Lily that Rickie remembered her, even after he had forgotten his own name. Lily resigns herself to ending up in hell, and accepts her fate passively. Ken lines the captives up and each one is asked, \"Who are you?\" and then bludgeoned unless they deny their existence. When it is Buffy's turn, she says her name with pride and a battle ensues until Ken threatens Lily at knifepoint. Ken delivers a speech, but Lily pushes him off the ledge onto a concrete floor. Lily then leads the captives back up through the pool as Buffy dispatches Ken. Once all of the humans are out of the demonic dimension, the pool gateway closes. Back in her apartment, Buffy packs her bag, ready to return to Sunnydale. She gives Lily her \"Anne\" identity. On her arrival back at the family home, Buffy is embraced by her relieved mother."

        "content": "Two LAPD policemen, Hank Rafferty and Charlie Reed, investigate a warehouse heist and discover a gang of thieves, one of whom kills Charlie before they escape. Meanwhile, Earl Montgomery's lifelong dream to become a police officer is thwarted when he flunks police academy for accidentally causing an explosion. After Hank receives a warning from Detective Frank McDuff after interfering with the investigation of Charlie's death, he meets Earl when Hank notices him trying to get into his car after locking his keys inside. When Hank questions Earl, Earl race-baits and insults Hank to the point of getting himself arrested. A bumblebee comes along, to which Earl is allergic, causing him to panic. From afar, it appears as if Hank is brutalizing Earl when he is actually attempting to shoo the bee away by swatting it with his baton; a man catches the incident on videotape. Because of the incriminating evidence and a spiteful Earl lying about the accused brutalizing, Hank is terminated from the police force and charged with aggravated assault against Earl. He is sentenced to six months in prison. After being released, Hank takes a job as a security guard and continues investigating Charlie's death. Noticing an alarm being tripped at a soda warehouse, Hank goes to investigate. Earl, who is working for the same security company, is on duty at the warehouse but is slacking off. Hank interrupts the heist, and a gunfight erupts with the thugs, during which Hank and Earl cross paths again. The two give chase to the thieves but are pulled over by the police for speeding. One of the thieves drops a cell phone, which leads them to a semi-trailer truck. Inside the truck, Hank and Earl find the thieves' van. Earl tries to hotwire the van but accidentally triggers the alarm, alerting the thieves. After a brief shootout, Hank and Earl drive the van out of the truck and escape. Inside the van are what look like ordinary beer kegs; Hank has them examined at a foundry, where they learn that the kegs are actually made of an atomic aerospace alloy, which is worth millions. Hank takes the van and the kegs to the house of his ex-girlfriend, Denise. They broke up after Hank was arrested, and Hank asks Earl to tell Denise the truth about the \"assault\". Earl promises, but when he sees that Denise is an attractive black woman, he breaks his promise and starts hitting on her, playing the victim again. This causes another fight between them, and Denise kicks both of them out. After a heated argument, Hank punches Earl in the face, before storming off. Later, the pair is cornered by police, learning that they are suspects in the earlier shootout. They escape and Hank realizes that the thieves must have an inside man in the police department. That night, the pair trace the van's owner to an address and stake out the place, but Earl rushes inside on his own and is confronted by the thieves. Hank arrives just as Earl is shot in the leg, and before escaping, he recognizes one of the thieves, Nash, as Charlie's murderer. When Hank takes Earl to Denise to get his wound treated (which turns out to be simply a graze), a bee flies into the house and Earl runs for cover, making Denise realize that Hank's story about the \"assault\" on Earl was actually true. She slaps Earl for lying and reconciles with Hank. Based on something overheard from Nash, they follow him to a meeting at a yacht club and witness him talking to McDuff, who is revealed to be Nash's inside man. Hank and Earl share everything they know with Hank's former boss, Lieutenant Washington, and then pretend to approach McDuff, offering to sell him back the \"beer kegs\" for $1 million. However, Nash learns about their plans and takes Washington hostage first. During the confrontation the next day, Earl and Hank meet with McDuff, Nash, and their men near the coast, rescuing Washington and accidentally starting a shootout, but the trio manage to kill or apprehend most of Nash's gang, including McDuff. Hank is shot, but he survives and kills Nash by dropping a nearby crane's lifting hook onto an unstable slab of rock that Nash is standing on, catapulting him into the ocean and finally avenging Charlie's death. Six more months later, in honor of their heroic actions, Hank is reinstated in the LAPD and Earl is admitted to the force, and they are made partners. The two encounter a situation similar to where they met, in which a man is apparently locked out of his car. Earl helps the man but learns that he is actually a thief. He successfully stops the thief by shooting at the car, but the vehicle explodes soon after."

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B+\" on scale of A to F. Joe Leydon of Variety wrote that \"Despite some tasty contributions from Lawrence and Zahn, too much of National Security has the bland flavor of microwaved leftovers.\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times said it \"Lacks the wit to do anything new and instead recycles tired jokes and attitudes.\" Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote was critical of the script but said the actors save the film, and concludes \"I wouldn't race out to see \"National Security,\" but it does give you exactly what you'd expect: yocks, explosions and funny brawling buddies rolling all over those over-used L.A. freeways.\" Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post panned the film calling it \"a by-the-numbers sop to adolescent testosterone overload\" and said that to call Lawrence \"a poor man's Richard Pryor\" was both an insult to Pryor and to poor people. Tom Long of The Detroit News wrote that the movie was \"loud, crass, dumb and then even dumber.\" John Monaghan of the Detroit Free Press highlighted what he saw as an \"off-putting\" racial subtext that made him unable to enjoy the movie. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave it a positive review and called it \"A funny, raucous action comedy, effectively teams Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn in a film that's both laugh out loud funny and surprisingly subtle.\""

        "content": "An unnamed man, simply called \"The Man in the Cube\" (Richard Schaal), is trapped in a cube-like white room as he asks if anyone can hear him. A stool is brought in by a maintenance man named Arnie (Hugh Webster) who discovers it covered in strawberry jam as he wipes it down. After Arnie leaves, the Man tries to find the door. He encounters a variety of people come through various hidden doors in which each one claim that he can get out through his own door. His first visitor is a woman named Margaret (Lolo Farell) who claims that the man is her husband Ted as she appears with parents (Alice Hill and Moe Margolese) are also present. Her door closes on the Man before she can get him out. The Man then meets Mr. Thomas (Rex Sevenoaks), the manager of this entire establishment. When asked about the Cube, Mr. Thomas states that he has asked himself that question many times where it is too good to be true. Mr. Thomas shows the Man the Call Button that he should push if he ever needs anything. Mr. Thomas then works to deny the fact that there are other Cubes like this while stating that while some people are quite content and stay in the Cube, others would wish to leave. As Mr. Thomas leaves, he tells the Man that he must find his own door. Arnie returns again where he gives the Man a telephone and states that he can get him anything he wants. Arnie exclaims that the only trouble with this establishment is that there is no organization and The Man wouldn't believe the weirdos that run it. He also talks about the four tons of chocolate rabbits while mentioning that he's been working here for 14 years where there hasn't been a request for chocolate rabbits. As Arnie goes outside to call the Man to see if the telephone is working, the Man sees a brief opening until the telephone rings and Mr. Thomas briefly appears to give the receiver to him before leaving. The Man answers it and Arnie tells him that the telephone is in business. The Man discovers that his telephone only calls up Arnie. When the Man throws it towards the wall, Arnie opens it as it flies through as Arnie rewards his accuracy by giving him a chocolate rabbit. Two police officers consisting of a police sergeant (Jon Granik) and Officer Fritz (Guy Sanvido) from the MPD enter with a search warrant. They find different things in the panels of the Cube like smuggled diamonds in the chocolate rabbit, a stack of gold bullion from the Bank of Munich, vital plans of the X-74 (which was classified top secret), microfilm documenting the entire National Security System, an arsenal (consisting of machine guns, sten guns, dynamite), and a bound and gagged Dr. Kingsley (who was missing for two weeks as part of a ransom). The Man is then handcuffed by the police sergeant in an uncomfortable way as the police officers leave with everything while telling the Man to wait until they return. A house painter and decorator named Miss Bix (Sandra Scott) comes in while the Man tries to get out of his handcuffs as Arnie comes in with the mustard paint in order to decorate the Cube. She then changes her mind and wants tangerine paint as the Man struggles to get his leg out from the position the handcuffs have him in. Upon trying to hold back the info on how long the Man will be in the Cube, Miss Bix changes her mind about the paint and has shellac sprayed onto the already white Cube as she leaves. Arnie states to the Man that he is actually spraying deodorant and that Miss Bix can't tell the difference. Before leaving, Arnie stops the Man from following him since this is Arnie's door. A guitarist (Ralph Endersby) comes in and gives the Man the keys to the handcuffs which frees the Man. Upon finding a bed that manifested, the Man rests on it while the guitarist practices his music. The guitarist is then joined by the rest of his band as they sing a song to the Man about never getting out of the Cube. After the band leaves, Mr. Thomas briefly enters telling the Man that the \"Rest Period\" is over. A prisoner named Watson (Jack Van Evera) enters the Cube having escaped from his Cube. He notices that the Man hasn't been here for long while mentioning how his Cube had squares while the Man's Cube has rectangles. Watson tells the Man that he had to tell how many times has passed by making marks in his thumbnail which didn't work when he lost his thumbnails. Watson decides to return to his Cube to see if he left anything behind. When the Man states that if he re-enters his Cube where he won't get out again, Watson ranted about having to depend on the squares. Watson decides to go back to his Cube. When Mr. Thomas enters asking if someone else was in his Cube, the Man states that there was a visitor. Mr. Thomas states that other visitor was acting and introduces him to Jack Van Evera who asks Mr. Thomas if they can take out the part about the thumbnails. As they leave, Jack asks Mr. Thomas what the rest of these Cubes are for anyway. Before leaving, Mr. Thomas states \"He was only kidding. You know that.\" A seductress named Cora (Eliza Creighton) enters as a couch and a liquor cabinet suddenly appear. Cora states that she always comes to the Cube. The Man sits down on the couch. As they make out, a physician named Dr. Bradowski (Eric Clavering) enters with Dr. Bingham (Moe Margolese) and a nurse (Jean Christopher) run some medical tests on the Man while Cora leaves. The doctors tell the Man his results before leaving to tend to a platypus. A professor (Don McGill) enters stating that him being here is either part of a teleplay or he's hallucinating. He even shows him the ending with him in the Cube with a girl before leaving. A black militant (Don Crawford) enters where he finds the Man's Cube is all white thinking that it's a mausoleum for whiteness while claiming that the Man will die in the Cube. The Man claims that this isn't his place and had nothing to do with the Cube's construction. When the black militant wants the Man to go out the door, the Man states that he can't since it's the black militant's door. The black militant then leaves quoting \"You make me sick.\" A classy party manifests in the Man's cube. When Mr. Thomas arrives offering tonic to the guests, the Man tries to get some only to be blocked by a barrier. A female partygoer named Mrs. Stratton (Alice Hill) exclaims that Mr. Thomas is projected and states that nobody having a party in the Man's Cube is real. The image of the party then disappears as it shows the Man on his stool. After a panel briefly opens where an old man (Eric Clavering) asks if he has considered that he is dead and this is what his afterlife is like, the Man is visited by a scientist (William Osler) who asks the Man to define reality for him. When the Man claims that the hammer doesn't exist, the scientist proves him wrong by throwing the hammer at one of the cube's walls causing a hole in it. Arnie reprimands the scientist for breaking the wall and gives him his hammer back while he gets the wall fixed. Upon being unable to convince the Man, the scientist leaves hoping that the Man rots in the Cube. Arnie fixes the hole and leaves stating that the scientist is a real pain in the neck. A woman named Liza (Trudy Young) enters where she gives the Man a hint on how to get out which is \"it's going to get worse before it gets better.\" Her other hint is \"don't trust anybody\" as she turns into an elderly-like appearance (Ruth Springford). After she leaves, Mr. Thomas enters stating that the Man's time is up and that he must leave. As the Man tries to leave through the door that Mr. Thomas claims to be the Man's door, the Man has his suspicions in which if he steps out the door, two gorillas in ballerina dresses would grab him, drag him back into the cube, throw him to the ground, and dance around him singing \"Home! Sweet Home!\" The Man attempts to step out and is assaulted by the ballerina-dressed gorillas (depicted as two men in gorilla suits) in the manner that he described where they substitute \"home\" with \"the Cube.\" Mr. Thomas leaves stating that the Man is getting pretty good at predicting these things. Two comics (Jon Granik and Guy Sanvido) enter and tell jokes to the audience. They then turn their attention to the Man when they find that he wasn't joining in on the laughter. The Man stated that he just didn't feel like laughing. The comics then laugh at the Man before leaving. A kid on a tricycle rides around the Cube mocking the Man stating that he's never going to get out of the Cube and then leaves. A monk (Jerry Nelson) enters and disperses his wisdom onto the Man while stating that he is part of the \"All.\" Before leaving, the monk gives the Man an orb called the Ramadar which is supposed to hold the meaning of life. After the monk leaves, the Ramadar only makes a grinding noise. The Man smashes it with the stool to find that inexplicably it is made of strawberry jam inside. Arnie comes in and cleans up the broken Ramadar stating that most people break their Ramadar. Arnie then leaves with the broken Ramadar and the broken stool. After six people bring in a coffin, the Man finds a gun is left in the room. Grabbing the gun, the man attempts to shoot himself and ink squirts onto his face. All the people he had encountered enter and laugh at him as Arnie states that this is all a joke. Enraged, he tells them he's had enough with their tricks and that no matter what happens he knows he is real. The Man then leaves the Cube as the people applaud him. The Man is then escorted into an office so that the head of the organization can sign his release. Once there, the Man reflects on the revelation of his own realness. He accidentally cuts himself with a knife while demonstrating and is asked to taste his blood. He does so and discovers his blood is strawberry jam. The head of the organization and his office fade away to reveal the Man is still trapped in the cube. As the credits roll, the Man wanders around the room one last time and then sits down on the floor apparently resigned to his fate of never getting out while the band's song is reprised in the background."

        "content": "In a parking lot, teenage filmmaker Eric attempts to document the Wannabe's lifestyle enjoyed by Allison Lang  and her boyfriend Toby's gang of white upper-class teenagers living in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well as her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs a blowjob on her boyfriend. The next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone. The next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game. That evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle. His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust. Allison winds up being arrested with the other present gang members, but \u2013 save for an argument with her parents and Toby \u2013 is let off the hook. The experience only serves to increase Allison's fascination with the inner-city lifestyle. The night after her release, Allison and Emily agree to head downtown the next evening to hang out with Hector's crew. The two meet up with Hector and his gang at a motel, and a night of partying and drinking results in Allison and Emily asking Hector if they can join his crew. Hector informs them of their initiation; to join the gang, the two must roll a dice; the number they roll corresponds to the number of gang members they must have sex with. Allison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three. Hector and Allison pair off, but Allison has second thoughts and refuses to have sex with him, and is thrown out of the room by the gang when she tries to get Emily to leave with her. Emily eagerly engages in sex with Hector, but as she does so, one of Hector's fellow gang members anally rapes her. When Allison storms the room and screams at the men to stop, they flee the room, leaving the two distraught women. The next day, Allison returns to the motel and confronts Hector over the previous night, but he responds by saying he didn't do anything wrong; that he only did what she and Emily had asked him to do. At that moment, a woman shows up at the door, surprising Allison, much to the amusement of Hector, who mocks Allison for thinking he had feelings for her, and calling her a poser who only knows how to play games and nothing about the realities of gang life. The same day Emily is shown at a police station accusing Hector and his crew of gang rape. Allison is brought in for questioning, but claims to know nothing about a rape. Hector is subsequently arrested, and members of his crew vow to seek out and silence Allison and Emily, but wind up getting lost in Bel-Air. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang are shown posing with guns in front of Eric and his video camera, making clear on their intent to seek revenge on Hector's crew. Eric later shows Allison the footage, and Allison subsequently calls Toby and makes an ill-fated attempt to convince him that there was no rape and what he is doing is foolish. Allison informs Emily of what Toby plans to do and reveals to Emily's parents the events at the motel. This initially upsets Emily to the point of nearly attempting suicide, but eventually the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang arrive at Hector's motel and bust in violently, but only succeed in frightening a group of Latina women and a baby. Toby tries to work up the nerve to shoot them, but, consumed by their desperate pleas to not hurt the baby, realizes he can't and storms out. On their drive home, the gang passes the SUV containing the members of Hector's crew that had been looking for Allison and Emily. The two gangs exchange looks, and the screen subsequently fades to black. After a few seconds the sounds of tires squealing, people shouting and gunfire are heard. As Eric concludes his film project, Allison ends the story saying that teens will be teens, but if adults are willing to reach out to them to connect and give them even just a small amount of insight, it's like that they now suddenly know everything."

The first 25 minutes take the form of a live \"UFO watch\" broadcast hosted by Radio 1 DJ Nicky Campbell and veteran TV astronomer Patrick Moore (of The Sky at Night) aboard an RAF Sentry aircraft. Campbell and Moore and the RAF crew deliver authentic reactions to the news that a large object is approaching the Earth. The object is subsequently revealed to be an alien spacecraft. When the alien mothership disgorges dozens of smaller ships that take up position over the world's cities, the broadcast switches to a press conference called by Prime Minister John Major and Opposition Leader Tony Blair to announce the formation of an emergency coalition government. DJ Mark Goodier reports from a rooftop on the alien ship's approach to London until it fires its weapon and the broadcast goes silent. After a brief pause the story continues in Maggs' trademark \"audio movie\" style, with original music from the film and sound effects and dialogue in Dolby Surround. Aboard the RAF Sentry, Moore and Campbell are shocked to learn that London has been destroyed. The alien ships launch fighters and the RAF Tornado pilots John Reginald and Becky Johnson engage them. Moore draws upon his vast scientific knowledge to advise the pilots on how to combat \u2013 or at least evade \u2013 the aliens. The fighters are then called upon to defend a BBC traffic helicopter that is attempting to carry the British Royal Family to safety. The RAF succeed in bringing down one of the alien fighters, and Moore has a close (and given his age, surprisingly violent) encounter with the alien pilot. Meanwhile, Wing Commander Reginald engages the aliens in a prototype Eurofighter. At the end of the show we learn that the Royal Family are safe and have invited Becky \u2013 a staunch republican \u2013 for tea at Balmoral. The surviving military forces of Europe and the Middle East are preparing to regroup in the Beqaa Valley.

When Maude is taken hostage in Lebanon, Ned must leave suddenly to get her released. In his haste, he agrees to let Lisa babysit Rod and Todd. Ned puts out the good word for Lisa, who experiences a business boom. Inspired by the success of Baltimore's revamped wharf, the Springfield Squidport reopens and throws a gala. Homer and Marge attend, leaving Lisa to babysit Bart and Maggie. Bart is upset that his younger sister is his babysitter; Lisa thinks his childish antics warrant it. Bart torments Lisa by having a giant submarine sandwich delivered, hiring Krusty for a bachelor party, claiming that Lisa saw a UFO, dialing  for a \"sisterectomy\", and feeding Maggie coffee ice cream for dinner. Bart's pranks anger Lisa so much that she lunges at him, causing him to fall down the stairs, dislocating his shoulder and causing a large bump on his head. Bart realizes if Lisa fails to take him to a nearby hospital, her reputation as a babysitter will be ruined. To make his condition worse, Bart locks himself in his room and repeatedly bangs his head against the door, eventually knocking himself unconscious. Lisa tries to call for an ambulance, but the  operator refuses to assist her due to Bart's earlier prank calls. Lisa considers asking Dr. Hibbert for help, but realizes that would ruin her reputation as a babysitter. Instead, she takes Bart to Dr. Nick Riviera's clinic in a wheelbarrow, bringing Maggie along in a pet carrier because the coffee ice cream has overstimulated her. Lisa is unable to see the doctor due to a long queue in the waiting room. Frantic, Lisa tries to wheel Bart and Maggie to the hospital. She loses control of the wheelbarrow and it rolls down a cliff into a muddy river \u2014 in front of aghast onlookers at the Squidport. The crowd assumes Lisa is on drugs, has murdered Bart, and is about to drown the caged Maggie, and accuse her of bad babysitting. Later, Bart, whose injuries have been treated, apologizes to Lisa for causing the ordeal and ruining her babysitting business. She forgives him, but feels bad for being called the \"World's Worst Babysitter\". Much to her delight, she receives babysitting requests from Hibbert and Ned because they cannot find any other sitters."

Brown and Chris Logan, the writers of the book The Psychology of the Simpsons: D\u2019oh!, the episode is an example of how feminine anger rarely solves the problem on The Simpsons. \u201cHere, Lisa\u2019s rage and ongoing frustration contribute to her difficulty in making good decisions about what to do with her emotion,\u201d they write. Keeping with the babysitter theme, there are cultural references to The Baby-Sitters Club: Lisa reads book #14 - The Formula Formula, while Janey is on book #20 - The President's Baby Is Missing. The idea of revamping the waterfront came from cities like Baltimore, who were always trying to fix formerly horrible places. Chris Turner, the author of the book Planet Simpson, writes about the scene at the Squidport: \"The \"satirical\" setting seems almost documentary\". The Squidport is a local revitalization project, which recast a historic industrial area as a pedestrian mall. He calls this an example of how \u201chyper-consumer culture of Springfield moves front and center\u201d On the waterfront, Rainier Wolfcastle opens a restaurant called \"Planet Hype\". This is a parody of the international theme restaurant franchise Planet Hollywood. Wolfcastle is a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who launched Planet Hollywood along with Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg in 1991. According to Matt Groening, the show had written an entire episode around Planet Hollywood, which featured the voices of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Willis as The Three Stooges type of characters. The episode was never animated, because it turned out that it was only the publicist of Planet Hollywood's idea and the actors did not want to participate."

        "content": "Fran\u00e7ois Pignon, an unassuming divorced man with a teenage son who ignores him, lives a quiet and unremarkable life. When he learns he will be fired from his job as an accountant in a rubber factory, he contemplates suicide, but his new neighbor Jean-Pierre Belone, a former industrial psychologist, dissuades him from jumping from his balcony and suggests a way to keep his position. Belone proposes that Pignon start a rumor he is homosexual by inserting his image in sexually provocative snapshots of a gay couple in a bar and anonymously mailing them to his boss, Mr. Kopel. The factory's primary product is condoms, so the gay community's support is essential, and Kopel will have to keep Pignon on the payroll to avoid charges of anti-homosexual bigotry. Pignon does not change his usual mild and self-effacing behavior and mannerisms in any way as part of his masquerade. But his supervisors and co-workers begin to regard him in a new light, seeing him as exotic rather than dull, and his life becomes unexpectedly and dramatically better. F\u00e9lix Santini, a homophobic co-worker who used to harass him, is warned he could be fired for discrimination if he continues to belittle Pignon, so he begins to make friendly overtures. The company enters a float in a local gay pride parade, and Pignon is coerced into riding on it; his estranged son sees him in the televised broadcast of the parade and tells his mother. The son is thrilled to learn his father, whom he has always considered bland and boring, has a wilder side, and expresses an interest in spending more time with him. His suspicious ex-wife invites Pignon to dinner and demands an explanation. He has by this point gained enough self-confidence to tell her exactly what he thinks of her. Meanwhile, Santini's charade of friendship has developed into an obsessive attraction; his wife suspects him of having an affair when she finds a receipt for an expensive pink cashmere sweater, and leaves him when he buys Pignon chocolates.  After this, Santini invites Pignon to move in with him. When Pignon turns him down, Santini snaps, a fight ensues, and Santini is institutionalized to recover from his emotional breakdown. Eventually, Pignon's ruse is discovered when Kopel catches him making love in the office to his co-worker, Mlle Bertrand. However, he has become so assertive that he keeps his job, relates to his son, patches up his relationship with Santini, cheers up Belone, and lives happily ever after."

        "content": "In 1984, Captain Ray Quick (Stallone) and Colonel Ned Trent (Woods), explosives experts working for the CIA, are on a mission to blow up a car transporting a South American drug dealer. But when the car appears, a little girl is inside with the dealer. Ray insists they abort the mission, but Ned intends to see it through and allows the explosion to happen, resulting in the deaths of both the drug dealer and the child. Furious by the girl's wrongful death, Ray savagely beats Ned and flees, effectively resigning from the CIA. Years later, in Miami, Ray works as a freelance hit man.  He lives a solitary existence with his cat, named \"Timer\". Desperate people contact him via an Internet bulletin board and he takes the cases that interest him. Ray specializes in \"shaping\" his explosions, building and planting bombs that blow up only the intended target while leaving innocent bystanders unharmed. He answers ads placed by a woman named May Munro (Stone) and speaks to her often to decide if he should take the job or not. During the talks, he becomes intrigued by her story, coupled with the fact that he sees how attractive she is while following her. She is the only child of parents who were killed by Tomas Leon (Roberts) and his men. Against his better judgment, and pushed by her insistence that she will infiltrate the gang with or without him, Ray is persuaded to accept the job. Even though he has agreed, May ingratiates herself into Tomas' world as Adrian Hastings. Ned now works for Joe Leon (Steiger), Tomas' father and director of their organized crime syndicate. Once the hits on their lower level guys begin, they contact the chief of police to place Ned in their bomb squad. May tolerates Tomas and plays along as his girlfriend so she can watch the hits one by one. It is revealed after the second target is killed that May has actually been forced into a partnership with Ned, whose goal was to coax Ray out of hiding. After the job in South America went wrong, Ned was dismissed from the CIA and is intent on revenge. When the trap for Tomas is set, May is in the room; the resulting explosion appears to kill them both. When Ned goes to Joe to pay his respects, he is left alive only so he can find Ray and bring him to Joe before Tomas is buried. Both Ray and Ned believe that May is dead, yet Ray discovers that bulletin board messages are still being posted. He responds to one, quickly realizing that it is a trap set by Ned and the bomb squad, and baits Ned into an explosive tirade. When he goes to the funeral of Adrian Hastings, Ray finds that May is alive. She went to the funeral to see if Ray would attend. Then they go to the Fontainebleau Hotel. They undress and make love in bed and in the shower. After this, she leaves. Meanwhile, Ned has gone to the cathedral and learns that the person in the casket is not May. She runs into Ned in the hotel lobby and makes an excuse as to why she did not tell him that she was alive. A henchman is ordered to take her to the car, and on the way, she asks to use the restroom. Once there, she uses a cell phone to warn Ray. He rigs the hotel room to explode, and when Ned's henchmen enter the room, it detonates, breaking the entire room off into the ocean. May is taken to Joe Leon but Ned insists on keeping her alive to lure Ray out. Ned listens in as Ray calls May, he refuses to meet with her and be \"set up\" again, but she convinces him that she truly does care about him. He arranges a meeting at a seafood restaurant and May uses secret coding to tell him it's a trap before hanging up. When Ned sends May inside, the restaurant explodes. Ray and May escape on a speed boat to his warehouse. Ned listens to the recording of Ray's call and tracks down his location. The next morning, May is preparing to leave to kill Joe Leon herself, but Ray tells her to let go of the past. Ned arrives with an army of police that surround the booby-trapped warehouse. In a final showdown, Ray and May are cornered. Ned pursues them, but is done in by his own hubris when he steps on a bomb. After the entire warehouse goes up due to the chain of bombs exploding, it appears that all inside have been killed, but Ray and May escape unseen through a tunnel. The next day, Joe reads about the incident at the warehouse. He thanks God for bringing his revenge on Ray and May. He then opens the mail brought to him and finds a necklace. It contains a picture of May's parents, seeing that it's rigged with a bomb, he curses God just before the necklace explodes. After hearing the blast and knowing all responsible for her parents' death are dead, Ray asks how she feels, to which she responds, \"Better\". They drive off to start their life together."

        "content": "In 1973, a squad of nine Louisiana Army National Guard soldiers convene in a local bayou for weekend maneuvers. New to the squad is Corporal Hardin (Powers Boothe), a cynical transfer from the Texas Army National Guard. He soon becomes disgusted with the arrogant behavior and attitudes of the men. A happily-married chemical engineer in his civilian life, Hardin wants no part of a date with prostitutes which PFC Spencer (Keith Carradine) has arranged for himself and their squad-mates. Nevertheless, he hits it off with the amiable Spencer, and both find themselves to be the most level-headed soldiers in their squad. The nine soldiers set out on patrol and soon get lost in the swamp. They come across a seemingly-abandoned campsite with several canoe-type boats called, pirogues. To continue onward, the Guardsmen need the pirogues to get across the flooded swamp. The squad's leader, Staff Sergeant Poole (Peter Coyote), a Vietnam War veteran, orders the soldiers into three of the pirogues. As they set out across the bayou, a group of Cajun hunter-trappers return and yell at the soldiers for having taken their boats. In response, PFC Stuckey (Lewis Smith) fires blanks from his M-60 machine gun at the Cajuns, thinking it funny when the Cajuns take cover. The Cajuns return fire with live ammunition, killing Poole and sending the squad into a frenzy as they make their way toward cover. Sgt. Casper (Les Lannom) \u2013 the strict, inexperienced, and unpopular second-in-command \u2013 orders the squad to continue their \"mission.\" They discover that Cpl. Reece (Fred Ward) has brought along a box of live ammunition for hunting purposes. Reece is forced at knife-point by Hardin to give up the live ammo, and Casper divides it evenly among the soldiers, in order to bolster their chances of defense. They reach the shack of a one-armed Cajun hunter-trapper (Brion James), who speaks only French. Casper has him arrested as a prisoner of war. The emotionally unstable Cpl. Bowden (Alan Autry) uses gasoline to ignite some TNT inside the shack, blowing it up, along with numerous provisions of food, fresh water, guns, and ammunition. The soldiers feel increasingly threatened. Hearing the barking of dogs, the Guardsmen presume they're about to be rescued. The dogs, however, belong to the Cajuns, who are now stalking the soldiers because of Stuckey's actions. The Guardsmen fend off the attacking dogs, only to find that lethal boobytraps have been set for them. Pvt. Cribbs (T.K. Carter) is killed when he trips a spear-bed built into a spring-released cradle-frame, impaling him. The squad camps for the night. Overnight, Bowden begins to have a serious mental breakdown, refusing to speak to anyone or move. The group decides to tie him up for the night. The following morning, Reece tortures the one-armed Cajun by dunking his head in a fetid pond. Hardin discovers this and tries to stop it. Both soldiers get in a fight to the death with bayonets. As the men fight, Hardin gains the upper hand, and to his surprise, the one-armed Cajun screams in English for Hardin to kill Reece. After Reece is killed, the one-armed Cajun escapes into the swamp. Stuckey, who was close friends with Reece, threatens to kill Hardin. As a helicopter passes overhead, the soldiers frantically try to signal it. Rushing headlong into the swamp after the chopper as it moves onward, Stuckey sinks to his death in quicksand. Having no confidence in Casper after his inept leadership, Spencer relieves him of command. They split up to search for Stuckey. Instead, the group locates the murderous Cajuns, and Spencer and Hardin shoot one of them dead. Casper throws a homemade grenade at the Cajuns to no avail, then fixes his bayonet to his rifle and charges at them. Both he and PFC. Simms (Franklyn Seales) are shot dead. Spencer, Hardin, and the now-catatonic Bowden camp for the night. The following morning Hardin and Spencer are jolted awake by a freight train, and then realize that Bowden is missing. They move to the train tracks and find Bowden hanging dead from a bridge. The one-armed Cajun appears on the tracks overhead. In perfect English, he warns Spencer and Hardin to leave the Cajuns' territory while they still can. He gives them directions on how to escape the bayou, since Hardin and Spencer saved him from physical assault by Simms and Reece. Following the one-armed Cajun's advice, Spencer and Hardin follow a dirt road and end up hitching a ride with a friendly Cajun couple. They are driven to a pig roast at a nearby Cajun village. As Spencer happily mixes with the villagers, a wary Hardin sees the arrival of the three remaining hunter-trappers who massacred their squad. One of Hardin's would-be-killers chases him into a shed and wounds him in the arm. Spencer suddenly shows up, firing blanks at the Cajun as a distraction, giving Hardin the chance to stab him in the groin. The other two Cajuns arrive, and Spencer runs, leading them away from the injured Hardin. Spencer, hiding around a corner, hits one of the Cajuns in the face with the butt of his M-16, knocking him out. The remaining Cajun gives chase, but as he is about to shoot Spencer, Hardin grabs him from behind. This gives Spencer the opportunity to stab him to death with his bayonet. Leaving behind the village, Spencer and Hardin slip away unseen into the swamp. As the duo moves into the swamp, another helicopter arrives overhead and seems to stay in the vicinity. They get back to the dirt road just in time to see a U.S. Army truck drive towards them. They look at each other, knowing they are finally safe."

According to Walter Hill he and David Giler had a deal with 20th Century Fox to \"acquire and develop interesting, commercial scripts that could be produced cheaply. Alien (1979) was one of them, and Southern Comfort was another. We wanted to do a survival story, and I'd already done a film in Louisiana.\" They hired a writer, Michael Kane, to do a draft which Giler and Hill then rewrote. According to Hill, \"No studio wanted to make it, but an independent guy showed up who had a relationship with Fox. Liked it, said he would finance it.\" The film was financed by the Cinema Group. This was a company headed by William J. Immerman, whose head of production was Venetia Stevenson, daughter of director Robert Stevenson. The Cinema Group had raised a fund of $30 million to make movies, half of which was private, the other half which was publicly raised. Southern Comfort was their second film. (Take This Job and Shove It was their first.) Powers Boothe was cast after Hill and Giler saw him play Jim Jones in the mini series Guyana Tragedy. Hill said the concept of Keith Carradine's character \"was that he was one of nature's aristocrats \u2013 graceful, confident of his own ability and able to separate himself from other people with an amusing remark\", whereas the character played by Boothe \"is much more the rational, hardworking, self made individual\" and as a result \"just cannot believe the nature of the situation at first\" whereas Carradine's can."

One of the first films to explore bisexual relationships, it was part of the brief porn chic fad of the Golden Age of Porn in the early 1970s that also included Behind the Green Door, The Devil in Miss Jones and Deep Throat. The film was based on an off-Broadway stage play that ran for 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 through November 15, 1971 and featured Sylvester Stallone in a brief role (as telephone repairman Mike). The theatrical version of Score was written by Jerry Douglas, who later became a mainstream screenwriter. It was set in a shabby Queens tenement, while the film was set in an elegant, mythical land and sported a relatively high budget for an independent film of that era. It has been released in both soft-core and hard-core versions. One DVD release, a soft-core version, shows a renewed copyright date of 1976 (all prints featuring the 1976 copyright are the director's approved, edited version), but the film itself was actually released in the United States in December 1973. Hardcore prints, including full-frontal male nudity and fellatio, run 91 minutes, while the ubiquitous soft-core prints were released in an 84-minute format. First Run Pictures marketed the original hardcore version on videocassette, though it was a limited release available by special mail order only. The restored, uncut and uncensored (hardcore) version was released by Cult Epics on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010."

This comes up in the wake of a swinging night with a couple of tourists picked up via a newspaper ad. Elvira, a self-professed \"sexual snob\" has bet she can seduce newlywed Betsy, married to handsome marine biologist Eddie. If she fails by midnight, then Jack gets to seduce Eddie. While Jack and Eddie go to work separately, Betsy comes round to visit her new friend Elvira. She's very intrigued by Elvira's open admission of her swinging lifestyle, including spouse-swapping and drugs. When Mike, the telephone repair man, arrives (Elvira had sabotaged the phone earlier just in hopes of a handsome man showing up), Betsy is fascinated and shocked as Elvira seduces him right before her eyes. She also admits that she's not really happy, especially after catching Eddie masturbating in the bathroom. But she says Elvira's actions are not for her, because at heart she is still a Catholic schoolgirl. Elvira tells a story about Jack, just before they were married, and how he said he would \"climb aboard a porcupine\" if he had a mind to. The two couples get together that night, and get slightly high on pot. Pulling out a trunk of costumes, they decide to play dress up. Jack dons a sailor's uniform while Betsy wears a very revealing modeling outfit. To Betsy's shock/tititalation (and Jack's huge amusement), Elvira's costume is based on a nun's wimple, but with nothing underneath. They tease Eddie into putting on a cowboy outfit. As the night progresses, the two wives and two husbands pair off to wander and chat. During the course of their conversations, each of the naive couple admit to dissatisfaction, including a questioning whether they ever should have gotten married. Eddie, it turns out, was Betsy's brother's best friend. There is a hint that he and Eddie were maybe closer than friends, although Eddie doesn't seem to know that Betsy might realize that. Betsy, meanwhile, lets her hair down and is even a little worried something might \"happen\" between her and Elvira. She also gets giddy at saying the word \"fuck\" for the first time. Downstairs, Jack, remarks to Eddie that just before he and Elvira were married, she commented, \"Jack, I'd hop in the sack with a porcupine if it struck my fancy.\" Elvira and Betsy end up in the upstairs bedroom, with Jack and Eddie in the downstairs den. A quick phone call between the swinging couple has them agree that midnight is the deadline for them both. As the late night progresses, both introduce their perspective seductees to amyl nitrite (each says the same line as they do: \"Bingo!\") and when asking for the time, interpret the respective watches as either \"slow\" or \"fast\" depending upon their own desires. Both Eddie and Betsy are simultaneously seduced, receiving and giving oral sex. Betsy is even penetrated with a strap-on (while wearing a collar and leash). Eddie, penetrated by Jack, has a brief hallucination that the person making love to him is Betsy. In the morning, Jack and Elvira consider the score pretty much even. Betsy and Eddie are confused, each thinking perhaps the other is the \"normal\" one. Betsy even makes a remark about them both being \"porcupines.\" When Mike suddenly arrives for a visit, just as Jack and Elvira are getting ready to have a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with Betsy, Jack invites him, too, boasting that they \"play all kinds of games around here\". A chance remark brings out the fact Mike and Eddie both enjoy bowling. Somewhat to Jack and Elvira's surprise, Mike leaves to play with Eddie and Betsy, who suggests they all get together soon to play \"Bingo\"."

Friend and former teammate Richie Fowler (Bruce Dern) offers Cat a job with his auto-leasing company, and a management position in the computer industry is also on the table, but Catlan hesitates, insisting he can still lead the squad to future glory. The associate with the computer firm (Bobby Troup) warns him not to put off making a decision: \"There are a lot of kids coming out of college, Cat, and they're smart kids. A year from now, I might not be able to offer you a job driving the company truck.\" Things are no better at home for Catlan: his long-suffering wife, Julie (Jessica Walter), threatens to leave him after too many booze-fueled outrages and late nights with other women. She begins to drift away into her own life, leading Cat to an abortive affair with Ann (Diana Muldaur). Cat finally begs Julie to stay, saying everything will be alright after he leads the Saints to another title. In the next game, against the Dallas Cowboys, Catlan succeeds in leading the Saints down the field, even scoring a touchdown himself. In the end, though, he is crushed in a violent sack by a Cowboys player, seemingly ending his football career (and possibly his very life, as Catlan takes what appears to be his last breath).

When the cameras weren't rolling we watched him try to throw some passes. His receiver was 10-20 yards away and his alleged passes didn't come close.\" Joe Wendryhoski, who basically played himself in the film as the Saints center, called Heston \"a great guy, very sociable\" who unfortunately \"didn't have an athletic bone in his body. As a quarterback, he left a lot to be desired.\" In the final scene when Catlan is crushed by the Dallas defense (actually portrayed by Saints players Mike Tilleman, Dave Rowe and Fred Whittingham), neither Heston nor the producer felt the hit on him was realistic enough, so Heston asked them to cut loose to really make it look authentic. On the second take, the trio slammed the actor to the ground, breaking three of his ribs."

Riva is deaf and mute due to a hereditary genetic deficiency, but travels with a \"chorus\" (Marnie Mosiman, Thomas Oglesby, and Leo Damian), an entourage of three people in telepathic communication with him, who are able to enunciate his thoughts. Riva dismisses the Enterprise crew's briefing on the history of the conflict, explaining that the dispute has long since become personal, regardless of whatever tangible concerns that may have started it. When Riva, his chorus, and several Enterprise officers beam down for the meeting, one tribal delegate fires upon them, killing the chorus. The tribe's leader immediately brands him a traitor and executes him, begging for the talks to continue, but the away team has already begun emergency transport back to the Enterprise amid the chaos. Riva, frustrated and agitated, struggles to communicate with the crew, so Picard orders Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to find and learn Riva's sign language in order to act as a translator. Picard offers to take Riva's place at the mediation, but Riva believes the Solaian tribes will only cooperate with him. Riva is prepared to abandon the peace process and return to his home planet, accepting his failure, but Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) inspires him to stay, suggesting that he turn his disadvantage into an advantage, recalling Riva's own negotiating tactic. Riva returns to the meeting spot on the planet, and to the crew's surprise, tells them that they should leave, and he will signal Starfleet when the negotiations are complete, as they may take several months. In order for the tribes to work with Riva, they will both be forced to learn sign language from Riva, which will create a shared experience between them. Thus, Riva is turning his disadvantage of being unable to communicate into an advantage. The crew leaves Riva to await the tribe representatives."

Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade B, calling it, \"A moronic but entertaining horror/sci fi film.\" TV Guide awarded the film two out of four stars, commending the film's acting, direction, and set design, calling it above-average. However, the reviewer felt that the film was somewhat hampered by its low budget. Dave Sindelar, on his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings gave the film a more positive review, writing, \"I have a lot of affection for this eerie horror/SF movie, though it took me a couple of viewings. The first time I saw the movie, I did get caught up in the eerie mood and the atmospheric sense of dread and tragedy that pervaded the castle, but the revelation concerning the nature of the true lord of the castle caused me to break out in laughter rather than to rear back in horror, and it ruined the movie for me. The second time I saw it, I was prepared, and was able to see beyond this flaw and appreciate how touching and sad the ending of the movie was.

        "content": "At the start of the film Malcolm is working for the Metropolitan Transit Authority (then operator of Melbourne's trams). Socially awkward and shy, Malcolm is obsessed with trams, but he is also a mechanical genius whose modest inner-city cottage is fitted with a variety of remarkable gadgets. When his boss (Bud Tingwell) discovers that Malcolm has built himself a cut-down tram during work time and using work materials, and has taken it out on the tracks, Malcolm is sacked. With his mother dead and no other income, the local shop-owner advises him to take in a boarder, Frank (John Hargreaves). Frank's brassy girlfriend Judith (Lindy Davies) soon moves in with him, and Frank reveals that he is a petty criminal who has recently been released from gaol. Despite their differences, the trio develop an awkward friendship, and when Malcolm learns of Frank and Jude's plans to stage a robbery, he decides to use his technical ingenuity to help them. In his first demonstration, he shows Frank the \"getaway car\" he has built, which splits into two independently powered halves, and they use this to successfully elude police after Frank steals some cash from a bank customer. For his next demonstration, Malcolm stages a near-successful hold-up of a payroll delivery, using a radio-controlled model car and trailer, fitted with a video camera, a speaker, and a gun loaded with blanks with which to threaten the guards. Frank walks in on Malcolm's bedroom \"control centre\" while the robbery is in progress; joining in, he helps Malcolm to steal the cash, although it is eventually lost when the planned getaway route (through a street drain) proves too small and the bag of cash is knocked off the trailer. The trio then devises an audacious plot to steal the weekly $250,000 cash delivery from a major bank, and Malcolm collaborates with Frank and Jude to create a set of ingenious inventions. They plant a set of armed, remote-controlled motorised robot rubbish bins inside the bank, which are then secretly manoeuvered up to an overhead walkway between the two bank buildings. When the guards cross the walkway with the cash on a trolley, they are bailed up by the robot bins. With Frank's specially modified Ford Transit delivery van, stationed below, a spring-loaded arm fitted with a hammer swings up, breaks the glass of the walkway window, and the robots push the cash into a chute fitted into the roof of the van. The trio then make their escape, stopping in a lane to disguise the van as an ice-cream truck; they also set loose a Ned Kelly-like dummy in a radio-controlled wheelchair, armed with two shotguns, which they send out as a decoy for the police while they make their escape. They manage to elude the pursuing police, but they are nearly caught when two officers on a routine patrol pull up beside them and ask them for an ice-cream. Frank speeds away, with the police in hot pursuit, and they now employ their backup getaway plan. They dump the van in a suburban street and decamp on foot, but when the police arrive moments later and scan the area for the fugitives, they see only the back of a tram, pulling away into the distance. However, when we see the front of the tram, it is revealed to be Malcolm's custom-made mini-tram, with the trio and their loot aboard. In the final scene, Frank is leaving a bank in Lisbon, Portugal (another city with a major tram network) where he has just deposited the proceeds of the Melbourne robbery. He then meets up with Malcolm and Jude at a local cafe, and as the film concludes they lay plans for another daring robbery."

As portrayed by Friels, Malcolm exhibits many traits that are characteristic of someone with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome, including a peculiar walk, reluctance to make eye contact, poor social skills and a deep-focus, obsessive interest (in this case, trams). David Parker had never written a script before and he did it while working on location of Burke and Wills as a stills photographer. Raising money was very difficult. Channel Seven agreed to provide $175,000 as a pre sale, Film Victoria came in for $100,000 and the rest of the movie was raised from Parker and Tass mortgaging their house and via 10BA. All of the gadgets in Malcolm's house and the ingenious inventions used in the robbery sequences were devised by writer David Parker."

Roy's reputation has doomed him to being un-hireable as a long time passes with no job offers. However, McCormick then gets one job offer, to Mount Vernon Junior High School, which was also where he graduated as a teenager. His alma mater's basketball team, the Smelters, is looking for somebody to coach the team, and the headmistress thinks an alumnus of his caliber in basketball would be ideal. Although irritated, Roy realizes he has no other options and accepts the coaching job, figuring this is the way to prove he can control his anger and get back into the spotlight of college basketball. As Roy begins coaching the squad, he gets into an embarrassing situation that he's never been in before and decides, enough is enough. He eventually starts teaching the concepts of basketball to his new team, albeit placing paramount emphasis on sportsmanship.

Unexpectedly, this leads Roy to find out he's been missing his simple love of the game the whole time.

The Enterprise taps into the Lantrees viewer, and finds that the crew appear to have died from old age, even though many were as young as the Enterprise crew. The only evidence of any medical problems was a harmless case of Thelusian flu in one of the ship's officers. They discover that the Lantrees last port-of-call was the Darwin Genetic Research Station on Gagarin IV. Captain Picard orders a quarantine warning broadcast to be set on the Lantree, and orders the Enterprise to Gagarin IV. As they near the planet, they receive another distress call from the station's researchers, all of whom have started a rapid onset of geriatric phenomena they believe is tied to the Lantree. When the Enterprise arrives in orbit, the research team's leader pleads to have the station's genetically engineered children brought aboard, asserting that they are safe, as they have been in isolation from the rest of the station. Picard is concerned with exposing the Enterprise to the same phenomenon that is affecting the station, but allows Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) to have one of the children beamed aboard encased in styrolite which shields the rest of the ship from possible contamination. The child is brought to sick bay, and Dr. Pulaski finds the child, a male teenager, to be near perfection, describing him as the \"next step in human evolution\". She convinces Picard to allow her to take a shuttle away from the Enterprise, so that she can examine the child outside of the styrolite without exposing the rest of the crew, and recruits Commander Data (Brent Spiner) as pilot, who as an android would be immune to possible infection. When she removes the protective material, the boy awakens and telepathically communicates with her. She is suddenly struck by joint pain, and recognizes that she has become affected with the same condition as the Lantree and station crew, and orders Data to pilot the shuttle to the research station. Dr. Pulaski continues to research the cause of the syndrome at the station. She learns that the children have been genetically engineered with highly aggressive immune systems that fight pathogens by genetically altering them \u2013 not just in the children's bodies, but in the surrounding environment as well. Recalling the Lantree officer with Thelusian flu, Dr. Pulaski postulates that the children's immune systems' reaction to the virus has created airborne antibodies that are attacking everything else, and consequently altering the DNA of normal humanoids to cause them to age rapidly and die. With this information, the crew of the Enterprise determine that the transporters can remove the antibodies and re-code an infected individual's DNA to normal, but only with a previous bio-pattern of that individual, and they do not have one for Dr. Pulaski due to her avoidance of transporter technology. The crew finds samples of Pulaski's hair in her quarters and using it as a template is able to restore her to full health. The Enterprise uses the same procedure to restore the station's staff, noting that the children will never be able to live alongside other humans, and then returns to the contaminated Lantree to destroy the ill-fated vessel."

Before Riker departs for the Pagh, Lt. Worf briefs Riker on Klingon customs, and gives him a transponder to signal the Enterprise in the event of an emergency. Riker embraces his role as the Klingon First Officer, and when challenged by Second Officer Klag, subdues him by force, pleasing Captain Kargan and earning respect from the crew. Before the ships move away, Mendon scans the Klingon vessel and discovers a patch of strange organic material on its hull but does not bring it to Picard's attention. Worf soon discovers a similar patch on the Enterprise hull, identifying it as a lifeform. Mendon then reveals his previous discovery of the same matter on the Klingon ship, and when asked why he withheld the information, explains that on Benzite ships, it is considered improper to bring up a problem before you have a solution. Picard chastises him and orders the Enterprise to intercept the Pagh, as the Klingon ship is even more susceptible to damage from the organism. While en route, Mendon discovers a method to remove the organism. The Klingon crew also discovers the organism eating away at their hull. Kargan concludes that it must be a new Federation weapon, noting that the Enterprise had heavily scanned the area during their rendezvous, and orders the Pagh to cloak and prepare to attack the Enterprise. Riker is unable to convince Kargan to stand down even after the Enterprise sends a message with instructions for removing the organism. Suspicious of the radio silence, the Enterprise raises its shields. Seemingly accepting his fate, Riker convinces Kargan to close to a distance of 40,000 kilometers before attacking the Enterprise. He activates the transponder he got from Worf and tricks Kargan into taking it. The Enterprise locks onto the transponder signal and waits for the Pagh to get within 40,000 kilometers, the range of the Enterprises transporters. Kargan is beamed to the Enterprises bridge and draws his disruptor but Worf fires first and stuns him. Riker assumes command of the Pagh, decloaks, and demands that the Enterprise surrender, which Picard agrees to, disgracing Kargan further. The Enterprise cleans the organism from the Klingon ship, and Kargan is returned. Riker allows Kargan to hit him and order him off the ship to allow the Klingon to regain some of his dignity before the Pagh departs."

        "content": "The Enterprise is sent to investigate the shutdown of the Argus Array, a deep-space telescope and radio antenna. Geordi La Forge and Lt. Reginald Barclay take a shuttlecraft to examine the array closely, discovering the presence of an alien probe nearby; the probe fires a pulse as they near it, disabling the shuttlecraft and knocking out Barclay. The Enterprise crew recovers the shuttle and are forced to destroy the probe when it follows the ship, believing the Argus Array was affected by a similar pulse. Barclay recovers, but the crew finds him to be much more intelligent than before, his IQ steadily rising. The Array starts to undergo a series of catastrophic failures. Barclay, with his newfound intelligence, casually explains how they can use the Enterprise computers to prevent the failures, a task that will only take them two days to complete, much to La Forge's disbelief. Though Barclay's solution works temporarily, the rate of failure drastically increases, and Barclay finds the Enterprise computer too slow to keep up with it. He goes to the holodeck and creates a device that allows him to interact directly with the Enterprise and array computer systems, putting an end to the Array's failures. The crew finds that Barclay has become too integrated with the computer, and when they try to shut down the computer, Barclay sends the ship into a \"subspace inversion,\" jumping the ship across a great distance faster than warp travel. They arrive at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and are met by a representative of a race of beings called the Cytherians, who are far more advanced than humans and find amusement in their \"bipedal locomotion\" and \"hierarchical collective command structure\". Barclay, who was removed from the computer by the Cytherians and has lost his heightened intelligence, arrives on the bridge to help explain what has transpired. The Cytherians are friendly explorers like the Federation, but instead of traveling themselves to meet other races, they instead have launched probes that instill the necessary knowledge into beings to make them come to the Cytherians. The probe was unable to reprogram the Argus Array or shuttlecraft, as technology isn't always compatible, and thus caused the failures in their systems. The Cytherians were, however, able to reprogram Barclay giving him the powers to accomplish his tasks. The Enterprise stays with the Cytherians for ten days, exchanging knowledge that will take decades to fully recognize. The Cytherians then return the Enterprise to the Argus Array. Barclay finds himself back to normal, although he keeps vivid memories of his temporary transformation and is able to play chess well even though he has never played chess."

Apparently the race in this star system are so lazy that they like to explore by bringing ships to them, so Barclay did exactly what they want. The Enterprise crew stick around to share information, and try not to think about the array they failed to repair.\"), remarks on trivia and passes judgment on the episode: Perhaps my favourite thing is that it didn't just go full Flowers For Algernon, which would've been the easy way out of the plot. Nope, the Enterprise crew completely loses control of the situation and basically they would've died if the circumstances had been less benevolent. In narrative terms it's probably not particularly satisfying for the lead characters to be passive observers to the story's climax, but as a sci-fi nerd I enjoyed the exploration of an idea through to its natural conclusion. Keith DeCandido, in his review for Tor.com, gave the episode an 8 out of 10, writing, \"it's an excellent episode that works on pretty much every level. It's a good sequel to \"Hollow Pursuits,\" as it gives Barclay what he always wanted \u2014 confidence, creativity, intelligence \u2014 but yanks it away from him at the end. It provides a wonderfully alien species in the Cytherians, who are in the fine Star Trek tradition of aliens who seem menacing but turn out to be more complicated than that. It makes very good use of Cyrano de Bergerac, one of the greatest plays in the history of human theatre. ... Ultimately, what sells it is Dwight Schultz, who gives a superb performance...\" Jamahl Epsicokhan, also citing Daniel Keyes's classic science fiction novel in a review of 4 out of 4 stars, writes, \"The character outline is Flowers for Algernon, except instead of taking a mentally challenged man and turning him into a genius, it takes a man of average intelligence (for this crew) and turns him into an ultra-confident, cosmic super-genius. In the opening scene, regular-Barclay is playing Cyrano de Bergerac in a performance that, let's face it, is pathetic despite his best efforts. Later, watch how genius-Barclay's acting is so mesmerizing that it practically makes Crusher weep.\" He goes on, The way the crew reacts to all this is absolutely honest human nature; they fear what they cannot predict or understand... especially when Barclay puts an energy field off the starboard side of the ship and prepares to send the crew 30,000 light-years through it... The suspense of what waits at the other side is one of the true moments of unpredictable awe in the Trek canon. What actually waits there, alas, cannot live up to that awe, but I did still enjoy the episode's sense of whimsical curiosity, in which it turns out that advanced aliens used Barclay as an implement to bring the Enterprise here in carrying out their own exploration of the galaxy. Barclay is of course returned to normal... \"The Nth Degree\" is a splendidly unique amalgam of tones and themes, plot and characterization, imagination and bemusement, and it ends up being one of the most fascinating hours in TNG's run.In 2020, ScreenRant ranked the Cytherians the 8th smartest aliens of the Star Trek franchise, highlight their knowledge of subspace distortions."

The job is successful, but it turns out the drug lord wanted his nephew free to kill him. Rudy is waiting with a getaway plane, but he sees police cars and leaves Doc behind. After a year in a Mexican jail, Doc sends Carol to mob boss Jack Benyon, who is looking to put together a select team of experts to rob a dog track in Arizona. Benyon agrees to get Doc released from prison, in exchange for sexual favors from Carol first. Doc gets out and meets the men Benyon has hired. One is Rudy, along with Hansen, who seems inexperienced. Rudy extends a hand and says \"No hard feelings\" but is punched by Doc and warned not to double-cross him again. At the track, while Doc is breaking into the vault, a guard pulls a gun and is shot by Hansen in a panic. The thieves escape by creating a diversion with a bomb under a gas truck and leave with the cash, totaling over one million dollars. The plan was for Doc and Carol to meet Rudy and Hansen later to split the money. On the road, Rudy kills Hansen and pushes him out of the car. Doc arrives at the rendezvous point, where Rudy again pulls a gun. Doc expected this and is ready with his own weapon, shooting Rudy and leaving him for dead. Doc and Carol drive off with all the money, unaware that Rudy was wearing a bullet-proof vest. A wounded Rudy drives to a local clinic, where he holds veterinarian Harold and his wife Fran hostage, forces them to treat his wounds and drive him to El Paso. An attraction develops between Rudy and Fran and they taunt her meek husband. At a motel, Rudy has sex with Fran after tying Harold to a chair. Hearing his wife's moans and her laughter at him, a heart-broken Harold commits suicide by hanging himself. Fran barely looks back as she accompanies Rudy to El Paso. Doc and Carol go to Benyon's house with the money. Benyon drops broad hints about what Carol did to get Doc out of jail. Carol approaches with a gun, unseen by Doc as he counts the money. Benyon clearly expects her to shoot Doc, but she kills him instead. Doc is upset, but Carol says she did what she had to do to help Doc and assumes he'd do the same if their situations were reversed. There continues to be tension between the pair, particularly when Carol loses the money to a con man at a train station in Flagstaff. Doc has to board the train, find the man and subdue him to retrieve the money. They proceed to the rustic Border Hotel in El Paso, owned by Doc's friend Gollie, to get new passports and identities so they can escape to Mexico. Rudy is already there waiting with Fran. Benyon's men, led by Jim Deer want the money and arrive in El Paso. Rudy sets a trap and Doc is startled to see him alive. He knocks out Rudy but resists killing him in cold blood. A long and bloody gunfight ensues with Doc and Carol shooting it out with Benyon's men in the halls and stairwells of the hotel. Rudy comes to his senses just as the last of Benyon's men die. He makes one more attempt to get the money, but after a hand-to-hand fight he is killed by Doc in an elevator when Doc shoots the cables, sending the elevator plummeting down to ground level, where his body is discovered by a screaming Fran. Doc and Carol make their way out of the hotel just as the police arrive, and hijack a pickup truck driven by \"Slim\", an old cowboy, forcing him to drive them to the border. After safely crossing into Mexico, they buy Slim's truck from him and drive southward, making their getaway."

It is the fourth installment of the Police Story series. Chan reprises his role as \"Kevin\" Chan Ka-Kui (named \"Jackie\" in international releases), a Hong Kong police officer who works for the CIA to track down and arrest an illegal weapons dealer. Jackie realizes that things are not as simple as they appear and soon finds himself a pawn of an organization posing as Russian intelligence. The film was shot partially in Hong Kong, Crimea (Ukraine), Moscow (Russia) and Brisbane in Queensland (Australia). Chinatown, Brisbane in Fortitude Valley and Underwater World on the Sunshine Coast were also used. Filming took place from August to November 1995. The film was released in Hong Kong on 10 February 1996. The original Hong Kong version was filmed in four languages: Cantonese, English, Russian, and Ukrainian. To advertise First Strike, Jackie recorded the song \u600e\u9ebc\u6703 Zenme Hui and also made a music video for it. As is typical with Chan's pictures, the US version does not feature the theme song.

One of the tasks the CIA gives him is simple enough: watch a woman named Natasha while on a plane from Hong Kong to Crimea (Ukraine) and record her movements. Jackie arrives in Ukraine and the CIA, partnered with local Security Service, take over the task of following Natasha. However, the CIA operation almost falls apart when the Ukrainian Strike Force arrest Natasha. Luckily for the CIA, Jackie spots Natasha being driven away and he discreetly follows her. During the chase in Yalta, Jackie discovers that Natasha is working with an unknown male partner, who actually called in the Strike Force to prevent Natasha from being followed. Natasha and the unknown male are also romantically involved. Jackie decides to follow the unknown male to a remote lodge in the Crimean mountains, and informs the CIA of his location. The unknown male is apparently meeting with Russian mafia members who are interested in a nuclear bomb that's in his possession. The criminals are on high alert when they spot Jackie and agents of Ukrainian militsiya and the CIA arriving. A gunfight ensues. During the battle, the unknown male is identified as Jackson Tsui (Jackson Lou), a Chinese-American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Jackie finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by mafia forces, Jackie loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters, and the mafia takes the briefcase. When he recovers in Russian military hospital, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov (Yuriy Petrov) of the FSB, who explains the situation. Jackie goes with him to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is smuggled into Brisbane, Australia by a Russian submarine. In order to find out where Jackson is, Jackie befriends his younger sister Annie (Wu Chen-chun), who works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Jackie pretends to be Jackson's \"sworn brother\". Chan's deception is successful, and he eventually meets Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss. Uncle 7 is seriously ill and will be getting surgery soon. While meeting Uncle 7, Jackie reveals the true nature of his visit to both Uncle 7 and Annie and informs them of Jackson's criminal activities. Jackie then meets with Gregor to report his findings. He tells Gregor that if Uncle 7 dies, Jackson will surely show up. Unknown to Jackie, Jackson is hiding at the hospital and has given a nuclear warhead (disguised as a small oxygen tank) to Annie, who hides it at the aquarium. While following Annie, Jackie gets held up by Jackson, who claims to have a deal with Gregor. He also reveals to Jackie that Gregor has secretly put audio bugs in several of the objects the FSB gave him. After realizing he has been used by Gregor for nefarious purposes, Jackie decides to return home and write a full report to both of their superiors. Two men are sent to kill him, and he is framed for the murder of Uncle 7. He attempts to clear his name by going to see Annie at the memorial hall, but he is (unsurprisingly) unwelcome, having to fight younger brother Allen Tsui and the family's bodyguards until Jackson arrives to clear Jackie's name. Jackson explains that Gregor caught him on a CIA assignment three years before, and forced him to turn into a triple agent: a CIA agent ostensibly turned by the FSB, but in reality serving Gregor's private criminal schemes. Gregor uses the nuclear warheads to secure stakes in oil franchises in the Middle East. Jackson was trying to get money from Gregor for the warhead. Annie, Jackie, and Jackson decide to work together to find Gregor and bring him in. Uncle 7's elaborate Chinatown funeral becomes the scene for a complex shootout between the various parties, injuring Jackson as he's caught in an RPG explosion. Annie and Jackie attempt to retrieve the stolen warhead from the shark pool (so that they can return it to the police), but Gregor and his men follow them, leading to a climactic confrontation underwater. During the fight, Gregor shoots the aquarium tank and shatters the glass, which releases a great white shark into the restaurant area. During the confusion, Gregor escapes with the warhead and kidnaps Annie to a getaway boat. Jackie saves the tourists from the shark and then pursues Gregor. While Gregor escapes in the getaway boat, Jackie finds and drives a Mitsubishi FTO display car onto the boat. The car pins Gregor, allowing Jackie to successfully retrieve the warhead and save Annie as armed police close in. Gregor and Jackson are apprehended by the Australian police and turned over to Russian authorities. The case is solved, and Jackie is thanked for his work by the FSB and returns to his work in Hong Kong."

        "content": "\"Vogue\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Madonna for her second soundtrack album, I'm Breathless (1990). It was released as the first single from the album on March 27, 1990, by Sire Records. Madonna was inspired by vogue dancers and choreographers Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza and Luis Xtravaganza from the Harlem \"House Ball\" community, the origin of the dance form, and they introduced \"vogueing\" to her at the Sound Factory club in New York City. \"Vogue\" is a house song which set trends in dance music in the 1990s with strong influences of 1970s disco within its composition. \"Vogue\" also contains a spoken section, in which Madonna name-checks various \"Golden Age\" Hollywood stars. Lyrically, the song is about enjoying oneself on the dance floor no matter who one is and it contains a theme of escapism. \"Vogue\" has appeared in a remixed form on two of Madonna's greatest hits compilations: The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration (2009). Critically, \"Vogue\" has been met with appreciation ever since its release; reviewers have praised its anthemic nature and listed it as one of Madonna's career highlights. Commercially, the song remains one of Madonna's biggest international hits, topping the charts in over 30 countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. It became the world's best-selling single of 1990, selling over six million copies. The accompanying music video for \"Vogue\", directed by David Fincher, was shot in black-and-white and takes stylistic inspiration from the 1920s and 1930s. Madonna and her dancers can be seen vogueing to different choreographed moves. The video has been ranked as one of the greatest of all time in different critic lists and polls, and won three awards at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards out of a total of nine nominations. Madonna has performed the song on six of her world tours, at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards and at her performance during the halftime show of Super Bowl XLVI. The song has also been featured on the soundtrack of The Devil Wears Prada (2006), as well as in \"The Power of Madonna\" episode of the Fox show Glee. Writers and critics have noted the video and the song's influence in bringing an underground subculture into mainstream popular culture through the postmodern nature of her power and influence, as well as the way in which it followed a new trend in which dance music enjoyed widespread popularity."

        "content": "Producer Shep Pettibone had produced successful remixes for a number of Madonna songs and provided additional production on her singles \"Like A Prayer\" and \"Express Yourself\". Warner Music head of dance music Craig Kostich approached Pettibone with the idea of collaborating with Madonna on a new song. Pettibone recalled that \"Vogue\" was created quickly and cheaply; he wrote and recorded the backing track in two weeks on a budget of $5000, then submitted it to Madonna, who wrote the lyrics and conceived the title. Madonna (who had just finished working on the Dick Tracy film and soundtrack) flew to New York and recorded her vocals in a small 24-track basement studio on West 56th St, in a booth that had been converted from a closet. According to Pettibone, Madonna was efficient in the studio, rapidly tracking all the verse and chorus vocals in order, in single takes. Pettibone proposed the idea of a rap to fill the middle eight. He suggested namechecking classic film stars, so he and Madonna quickly wrote a list of names and she recorded it immediately. Pettibone also came up with the vocal coda (\"Ooooh, you've got to, let your body move to the music\"). After Madonna returned to Los Angeles, Pettibone added piano and altered the bassline to fit her vocal. The finished song was submitted to Warners, three weeks after Kostich's approach. \"Vogue\" was originally intended to be the B-side for \"Keep It Together\" (the final single from Like a Prayer), but after the completed track was presented to Warner Bros. executives, all parties involved decided that \"Vogue\" should be released as a single. Although the song itself had nothing to do with Dick Tracy, it was included on the album I'm Breathless, which contained songs from and inspired by the film. Madonna altered some of the suggestive lyrics because the song was connected to the Disney film via soundtrack. \"Vogue\" was also used in a commercial for Dick Tracy, prompting TV Guide Magazine to condemn the commercial as false advertisement."

        "content": "\"Vogue\" is a house song with disco influence. The song has been noted by AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine to have a \"deep house groove\" and to have a \"throbbing beat\" by Mark Coleman of Rolling Stone. The backing track also features elements of salsa-influenced soul music, including in the form of samples of horns and strings from the 1982 Salsoul Orchestra track \"Ooh I Love It (Love Break)\", the inclusion of which was later the subject of a lawsuit. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, wrote that the song was a \"pulsating dance track\". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com at Alfred Publishing, the song is written in the key of A\u266d major, has a tempo of 116 beats per minute, and in it, Madonna's vocal range spans from C4 to E\u266d5. Lyrically, the song has a theme of escapism, and talks about how any person can enjoy themself. In the bridge, the song has a spoken rap section, in which Madonna references sixteen \"Golden Age\" Hollywood stars from the 1920s to the 1950s. In order of mention in the lyrics, they are Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, Joe DiMaggio, Marlon Brando, Jimmy Dean, Grace Kelly, Jean Harlow, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall, Katharine Hepburn, Lana Turner and Bette Davis. Ten of the stars mentioned in the song (namely Davis, Dean, Dietrich, DiMaggio, Garbo, Harlow, Rogers, Turner, and both Kellys) were entitled to a royalty payment of $3,750, payable to their estates, when Madonna performed \"Vogue\" at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, as their likenesses were displayed during the performance. At the time, Bacall was the lone living star; she died in 2014, at the age of 89. Madonna and Pettibone were sued by VMG Salsoul in June 2012 based on the accusation that they had sampled the 1976 song \"Love Break\" by the Salsoul Orchestra. Pettibone's defense was that he recreated the horn sound, not sampled it. The case was decided in Madonna's favor; the judge found that \"no reasonable audience\" would be able to discern the sampled portions, as they were insignificant to \"Vogue\". That decision was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals."

        "content": "In 1906, Wilse Dilling (Lon Chaney), a crippled gangster living like a brute in the savage streets of Chinatown, receives a coded message to go to the home of his boss, Ann Cardington (Christine Mayo), known as Queen Ann, a powerful crime boss feared in the underworld. When Wilse meets with her, she sends him to the town of Fallbrook, where he is to await her instructions in dealing with a former lover of hers, a banker named Micha Hadley (William Welsh), who had betrayed her. Dilling is to pose as a telegraph operator in his effort to watch the banker. Being practically dependent on crutches and wheelchair-bound has not stopped Dilling from committing a lengthy series of crimes, but to his surprise, he finds that the small town atmosphere makes him feel differently about everything. He finds a good friend in Hadley's daughter Gertrude (Virginia Valli). Dilling not only falls in love with her but she helps him believe that he can make a fresh start. Gertrude, however, is engaged to Jack Cooper (Jack Mower). Dilling's new-found contentment is soon shattered by a series of new developments which includes trying to stop Queen Ann's plot against Hadley and Gertrude. Threatened with exposure as a thief, Hadley lashes out at Dilling when he confesses his part in the scheme. When an attempt to blow up the bank goes badly, Gertrude and Cooper are caught in the blast. With Gertrude severely injured, Cooper's father forces him to break off their engagement. With the bank records destroyed, bank examiners are unable to find evidence against Hadley. After surgery, his daughter is expected to make a complete recovery but Queen Anne still seeks his revenge. Dilling tries to recover a document that his boss is holding, but with her henchmen, she captures Gertrude to Dilling's despair. Before anything can happen, everyone in the Manadarin Cafe, the gangsters' headquarters, as well as the entire city, is caught up in the San Francisco earthquake. Dilling survives and later in recuperation, is able to recover the use of his legs, beginning a new life with Gertrude."

He is in a long-distance relationship with his high school girlfriend, Kimberly Jasney, who is currently a student at the University of Memphis. Wyatt loves Kim, even though they have never consummated their love. One day when Wyatt calls Kim, her roommate's reply leads him to believe that Kim is cheating on him with some guy named \"The Ricker\". Heartbroken, he goes to a strip club, gets drunk and becomes acquainted with one of the club's dancers, Ivy Miller. She suggests to Wyatt that he break up with Kim by sending her a scathing letter and a topless picture of himself with Ivy. Wyatt complies by sending the package through Global Express, an overnight delivery service. The next morning, Kim calls Wyatt claiming \"The Ricker\" is a dog who she had to dogsit. Regretting his actions, he realizes he has 24 hours to retrieve the package before it gets to her. Wyatt and Ivy go to the Global Express office where, by chance, they encounter a spiteful classmate of Wyatt's who refuses to help them. Wyatt tries to talk Hal Ipswich, the deliveryman, into giving him the package, but he thinks Wyatt is a spy for the company, and refuses to break the rules. Wyatt buys an air ticket to Memphis, but his co-passenger turns out to be a serial killer, John Dwayne Beezly, who takes him hostage. Wyatt escapes and runs into Ivy on the road. Fearing that if he went back to the airport, the FBI would question him and he would not make it to Memphis in time, he begs Ivy to drive him all the way. They happen upon the Global Express delivery truck at a gas station. Wyatt breaks into the truck and locates the package, but the truck unexpectedly drives off. Ivy gives chase but despite their efforts they fail to retrieve the package. At their next stop, Des Moines, Iowa, airport officials do not allow Wyatt to board the connecting flight. So they decide to travel to St. Louis, Missouri to board another connecting flight. En route to St. Louis they have an argument which leads to an accident which ends up with their vehicle falling into the river. They have dinner in a cowboy diner and then try to run out on the check, but get arrested. After posting bail, they are let off and once again happen upon the delivery truck outside a diner. While Hal is having dinner, Wyatt decides to empty the truck's gas tank in order to stall him, but a carelessly flung cigarette butt sets fire to the gas and causes the truck to explode. But even that doesn't stop the deliveryman (who is clearly over the edge by now) and he drives off. Wyatt and Ivy then steal a drunk's car and drive to Kim's campus. After saying goodbye to Ivy, Wyatt gives chase to Hal and stops him in time. But after meeting Kim, Wyatt suddenly realizes that he loves Ivy and not Kim. After breaking up with her, he runs into another guy who is wearing the same kind of locket that Kim gave him long ago. Wyatt correctly surmises that the guy is none other than \"The Ricker\" and Kim was cheating on him after all. He allows Hal to deliver the package, and confesses his love to Ivy, who kisses him passionately."

        "content": "James Curtayne (Tracy) was once a highly successful prosecutor as a New York City district attorney, driven from his job and the high pressure field of criminal law by the bottle. After a long \"vacation\" he\u2019s attempted to settle into less demanding civil law to make it to an overdue but now financially postponed retirement. Johnny O'Hara (Arness), a boy from the old neighborhood, is accused of a murder.  His parents head straight for Curtayne. Unable to pay they nonetheless beg \"the counselor\" to take the case.  He accepts - knowing it will be a tough go, both personally and professionally. Johnny's boss, Bill Sheffield, was shot and robbed during the night on the stairs of his home by two people in an older coupe. The murder is seen from a distance by a man coming out of a saloon. Police trace the car to Johnny. When detectives come to question him, Johnny flees, claiming he believed they were thugs after him. During his questioning, Detective Ricks (O'Brien) and District Attorney Barra (Hodiak), reveals the murder weapon also to have been his. Johnny claims both were stolen. A young punk, Pete Korvac (Campbell), is brought in.  He claims he was the driver, and fingers Johnny as the trigger man. Johnny admits he\u2019d had a beef that day with Sheffield over some overtime pay but insists he was working all night. The night watchman refutes it. Instead, Johnny had been breaking up with his lover, Katrina (Duguay), the young wife of a tough mobster who controls the waterfront, \"Knuckles\" Lanzetti (Ciannelli).  Knowing what would happen to Katrina if he reveals the truth, Johnny lies to both the D.A. and his own attorney. Curtayne, a widower, is cared for by his doting but over-protective daughter, Ginny (Lynn).  She has put her own future with fiance Jeff (Anderson) on hold for two years keeping her father on the wagon. Professing confidence he can handle the strain, Curtayne is forced to do his own leg work.  He visits the Korvac family, who stonewall him, loudly proclaiming they have no use for the slippery Pete. Curtayne visits Knuckles, suspicious of his involvement but willing to horse-trade information upon accepting Knuckles' denials...yet unwilling to accept the mobster's offer to pull strings on his behalf. At trial Johnny's alibi about being at work all night is shattered. Pete's chatty double-talk is convincing and Curtayne proves unable to rattle him. The counselor confides in Ricks, his old friend, that his mind is failing him, the toll of age, drink, the stakes, and a competent younger adversary he cannot better. Desperate, he turns a sip of a \"short beer\" into shots of straight rye.  Approached in the bar by the eyewitness, a Norwegian seaman, Sven Norson (Flippen), with an offer to change his story, Curtayne caves to his demons and writes out a $500 personal check. D.A. Barra discovers the bribe, reveals it to Curtayne, but holds it sub rosa. He still easily wins the case, leaving Johnny facing the electric chair and Curtayne disbarment.  Sensing a frame, Ricks tips his old friend off about Johnny's involvement with Katrina, a relationship that began on the docks before World War II, before Johnny shipped out to the Pacific for the duration and she married Knuckles.  Curtayne confronts her.  Grief-stricken, she tells the truth in front of the D.A., willing to accept the consequences in hopes of saving her love. Johnny continues to deny being with her, but the men see through it. Knuckles remains clueless. Upon discovering Johnny had been set up, Curtayne, Ricks, and Barra revisit the crime, trying to tease out a motive.  A tale planted by Pete about a \"gold bar\" the victim was carrying in an empty suitcase found in Johnny\u2019s car again fails scrutiny; instead, lab tests reveal the battered old bag had actually been impregnated with $200,000 worth the narcotics destined for the \"Chicago mob\".  They devise a scheme to plant a lookalike in the home and entrap whomever comes to steal it.  Knuckles, who again professes a debt to Curtayne for not sending him to prison - or worse - when Curtayne had the chance before he dissolved in drink, agrees to spread the word about the suitcase's planned return that night around town. Curtayne, wired for sound, volunteers to be the pigeon to deliver it and lie in wait for whomever was behind the original killing.  It turns out to be the eldest Kovac brother, who tells him Knuckles is dead, abducts Curtayne, and marches him suitcase in hand towards the river and certain death. Barra orders a police dragnet to close in on the area, but it proves too late.  Even a last-ditch effort of a police woman who volunteers to intercept the pair fails in a hail of gunfire, with Curtayne felled point-blank by Kovacs.  Moved by Curtayne's heroism, Barra tells Ricks he'll have to find someone else to press the bribery indictment against the wounded man, as he won't.  Before Ricks can respond the ambulance medic interrupts to tell them he hopes it wasn\u2019t anything important because Curtayne is dead."

She hires an upmarket prostitute, who works as a hairdresser, to seduce her husband and tell her the details of their meetings. She asks the girl to play a character for this and to be called Nathalie. Nathalie accepts and a very ambiguous relationship is created between the two women. Nathalie uses very crude words to describe her meetings with Bernard. Many times the contract between the two women is broken (because it goes too far or because Catherine is no longer sure of what she wants) but each time Catherine relaunches the relationship. The two women get so close that when Nathalie finds herself homeless, Catherine finds her new accommodation, she also introduces Nathalie to her mother. The relationship is complicated when Nathalie, still playing her role, announces to Catherine that Bernard wants to live with her. Catherine asks for explanations from her husband who swears that he has no other woman in his life. Perplexed, Catherine leads Bernard into the bistro which is her meeting place with Nathalie. When Nathalie enters the establishment and sees the couple, she flees. Nathalie then confides in Catherine that she made everything up and that she never met Bernard.

It stars Warren William, Joan Blondell, Aline MacMahon, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell, and features Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks and Ginger Rogers. The story is based on the play The Gold Diggers by Avery Hopwood, which ran for 282 performances on Broadway in 1919 and 1920.  The play was made into a silent film in 1923 by David Belasco, the producer of the Broadway play, as The Gold Diggers, starring Hope Hampton and Wyndham Standing, and again as a talkie in 1929, directed by Roy Del Ruth. That film, Gold Diggers of Broadway, which starred Nancy Welford and Conway Tearle, was one of the biggest box office hits of that year, and Gold Diggers of 1933 was one of the top-grossing films of 1933.  This version of Hopwood's play was written by James Seymour and Erwin S. Gelsey, with additional dialogue by David Boehm and Ben Markson. In 2003, Gold Diggers of 1933 was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "The \"gold diggers\" are four aspiring actresses: Polly (Ruby Keeler), an ingenue; Carol (Joan Blondell), a torch singer; Trixie (Aline MacMahon), a comedian; and Fay (Ginger Rogers), a glamour puss. The film was made in 1933, during the Great Depression, and contains numerous direct references to it. It begins with a rehearsal for a stage show, which is interrupted by the producer's creditors who close down the show because of unpaid bills. At the unglamorous apartment shared by three of the four actresses (Polly, Carol, and Trixie), the producer, Barney Hopkins (Ned Sparks), is in despair because he has everything he needs to put on a show, except money. He hears Brad Roberts (Dick Powell), the girls' neighbor and Polly's boyfriend, playing the piano. Brad is a brilliant songwriter and singer who not only has written the music for a show, but also offers Hopkins $15,000 in cash to back the production. Of course, they all think he is kidding, but he insists that he is serious \u2013 he offers to back the show, but refuses to perform in it, despite his talent and voice. Brad comes through with the money and the show goes into production, but the girls are suspicious that he must be a criminal since he is cagey about his past and will not appear in the show, even though he is clearly more talented than the aging juvenile lead (Clarence Nordstrom) they have hired. It turns out, however, that Brad is in fact a millionaire's son whose family does not want him associating with the theatre. On opening night, in order to save the show when the juvenile cannot perform (due to his lumbago acting up), Brad is forced to play the lead role. With the resulting publicity, Brad's brother J. Lawrence Bradford (Warren William) and family lawyer Faneuil H. Peabody (Guy Kibbee) discover what he is doing and go to New York to save him from being seduced by a \"gold digger\". Lawrence mistakenly identifies Carol as Polly, and his heavy-handed effort to dissuade the \"cheap and vulgar\" showgirl from marrying Brad by buying her off annoys her so much that Carol plays along, but the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Trixie targets \"Fanny\" the lawyer as the perfect rich sap ripe for exploitation. When Lawrence finds out that Brad and the real Polly have wed, he threatens to have the marriage annulled, but relents when Carol refuses to marry him if he does. Trixie marries Faneuil. All the \"gold diggers\" (except Fay) end up with wealthy men."

Vikram, a gangster and drug dealer living in London. The container is shipped off by Vikram's henchman and is on the move. The access card of the container goes to the possession of pop star Chandralekha, an acquaintance of Vikram. CBI SP Lakshminarayanan is assigned to track down the stolen currency within the next ten days, on time for the upcoming budget allotment for the fiscal year. Lakshminarayanan tracks down Chandralekha who tactfully escapes from him and tries to reach Vikram, when she comes across two small time burglars \u2013 Kadhir and Azhagu. The duo are on the run from the police after a successful burglary in the countryside. A village belle Rasathi, who tries to escape from her abusive relatives also tags along with the thieving duo. Chandralekha and the trio end up traveling together due to circumstances. When Chandralekha tries to double cross the thieves and escape, they steal her purse containing the access card as revenge. Realizing this, she comes back to them and only then does the duo realize the actual worth of the access card. They all make a plan to pursue the money container somehow, but Vikram tries to chase down and kill all of them to get the card back at any cost. While on the run from the police and Vikram, they come across the very same truck containing the loot and manage to bring it under their possession. They hide it away from prying eyes with the entirety of the loot still intact inside the container. With Lakshminarayanan and his brigade of CBI officers close at his tail, Vikram stops at nothing to get his loot back, but is outwitted repeatedly by the thieves. Vikram finally manages to find Chandralekha, gets the access card from her and she is left to die in the forest, but is rescued and taken into custody by Lakshminarayanan, who interrogates her and she cooperates with them to find the container. Meanwhile, Kadhir and Rasathi are mutually attracted to each other but Kadhir sacrifices his love for her after realizing that his best friend Azhagu is also in love with Rasathi. Rasathi, who does not want to continue with this love triangle, opts out and leaves them both, but Vikram captures her. Kadhir and Azhagu, in a bid to save her, point to the location of the currency container and Vikram escapes with the loot on a train, taking Rasathi as a hostage. Lakshminarayanan finds that the loot is being transported on a train and is in hot pursuit, while Kadhir and Azhagu also get on the train to save Rasathi from Vikram. They save Rasathi together and subdue Vikram, who falls off the train. Azhagu also steals the access card from him. Now that they are finally in possession of the loot, Kadhir and Azhagu playfully argue about who would marry Rasathi and leave the other to manage the loot, each indicating that they are more interested in the money than their love for Rasathi, so she grabs the access card and throws it away and chases them around. Lakshminarayanan arrives at the nick of time and takes the access card and the currency container back to the Indian government where it actually belongs and finally restores order."

When writing the script of the film, Mani Ratnam went on a recce with Ram Gopal Varma and both filmmakers spent a few days each fine-tuning each other's scripts. While Varma worked on parts of Thiruda Thiruda, Mani Ratnam helped script Varma's political thriller film, Gaayam (1993). With the script of Thiruda Thiruda, he wanted to attempt the caper genre for the first time and took Rajasekhar's Vikram (1986) and Varma's Kshana Kshanam (1991) as his initial inspirations. He was also inspired by the ongoing financial scandal involving stockbroker Harshad Mehta, which had made Indian national news during early 1992 and chose to adapt his script accordingly. The American film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) was another influence on Thiruda Thiruda. J. D. Chakravarthy was initially meant to play the role of Kadhir before Anand was selected. Salim Ghouse, a renowned theatre artist, was roped into play an antagonist. Before finalising Anu Aggarwal for a role, Mani Ratnam considered Dimple Kapadia but opted against signing her as he wanted to select an actress new to Tamil cinema.

It is the title track from her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992), and was released as the album's lead single on September 29, 1992, by Maverick Records. It was later included on her greatest hits albums GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009). The song was written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin, while production was handled by the singer and Pettibone. Musically, \"Erotica\" contains spoken word vocals, and is an ode to S&M, with Madonna using a pseudonym called \"Dita\". She invites her lover to be passive while making love to her and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. The song debuted at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of the highest debuts on the chart history at the time, eventually peaking at number three. Additionally, it became a success on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, reaching the top position. \"Erotica\" also found commercial success internationally, peaking in the Top 10 in several countries including Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In Italy and Greece it peaked at number one. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by fashion photographer Fabien Baron, and features Madonna dressed as a masked dominatrix interspersed with footage of the making of the singer's Sex book, with cameos by celebrities such as Naomi Campbell and Big Daddy Kane. The video was highly controversial, being aired by MTV only three times, all after the 10pm watershed, before being completely banned. Madonna performed \"Erotica\" on three of her concert tours, the first being on The Girlie Show World Tour (1993), the Confessions Tour (2006) and most recently on The MDNA Tour (2012). The song has also been covered and parodied by several artists."

        "content": "In 1992, Madonna founded her own multi-media entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, Erotica, and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled Sex. For the album, Madonna primarily collaborated with producer Shep Pettibone.  Pettibone first began working with Madonna during the 1980s, providing remixes for several of her singles. Alongside Pettibone, Madonna enlisted help from producer Andr\u00e9 Betts, who previously co-produced \"Justify My Love\" for The Immaculate Collection. Madonna said that she was interested to work with Pettibone and Betts due to their ability to remain plugged into the dance underground, \"They come from opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their music style and approach to music, but they're both connected to the street and they're still young and hungry\". According to Pettibone in an article \"Erotica Diaries\" published on Madonna's Icon magazine, he produced a tape with four songs, for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working together in November 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. They were in the studio for a week and then she would work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet Andr\u00e9 Betts.  The first batch of songs Madonna and Pettibone worked on were \"Erotica\", \"Deeper and Deeper\", \"Rain\" and \"Thief of Hearts\"; she would write the lyrics as Pettibone worked on the music. Pettibone recalled that the singer preferred to be in control of the writing process because \"her songs are her stories. They're the things she wants to say\". While they were mixing a song called \"Erotic\", which was released as promotional single on her Sex book, Pettibone recalled: \"You have all these great stories in the book,\" I told her, \"Why don't you use them in the song?\" I knew that Madonna was developing a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far she was willing to go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter [ego], Dita. Madonna took the book and walked out of the room and didn't come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. \"My name is Dita,\" she said, \"and I'll be your mistress tonight.\" I knew that the original \"Erotica\" would never be the same again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore."

It also samples \"El Yom 'Ulliqa 'Ala Khashaba\" by Lebanese singer Fairuz. This sample caused controversy after Fairuz claimed her vocals had been used without her consent, and said the lyrics \"He was crucified today\", which are sung in Arabic, are taken from a religious song that is traditionally heard during Good Friday services. This led to a lawsuit that was settled out of court. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F-sharp minor with Madonna's vocals spanning from F3 to A4. Also present throughout the song are maracas and  \"shimmering horn riffs\". According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, the song is \"an ode to S&M\". It begins with a \"put-a-record-on scratchiness\" sound that mimics a record player. Following this, Madonna says, \"My name is Dita\", as she invites her lover to be passive and childlike while she makes love to him and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. Madonna's use of the pseudonym \"Mistress Dita\" in the song, as well as in Sex, is a homage to Dita Parlo, a German actress who was known for \"not caring what people thought\". The song has suggestive lyrics, such as \"Will you let yourself go wild/Let my mouth go where it wants to\". Slant Magazine described these lyrics as \"taunting, aggressive\u2014an elaborate exploration of sex, from seduction to disease\". A similar song titled \"Erotic\", was created during the Erotica album sessions exclusively to accompany the 1992 book Sex. The song, a stripped-down version of \"Erotica\", includes lyrics not heard in the original track such as \"We could use the cage, I've got a lot of rope\". Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, called \"Erotic\" a \"more hardcore\" version of \"Erotica\"."

        "content": "In the early 1980s, retired Marine Colonel Jason Rhodes is obsessed with finding his son Frank, an Army Lieutenant listed as \"missing in action\" since 1972. After 10 years of searching Southeast Asia and turning up several leads, Rhodes believes that Frank is still alive and being kept in Laos as a prisoner of war. After petitioning the United States government for help, but receiving none, Colonel Rhodes brings together a disparate group of Vietnam War veterans, including some who were a part of Frank's platoon:  Wilkes, a \"tunnel rat\" who suffers from PTSD; \"Blaster\", a demolitions expert; and \"Sailor\", a crazed yet loyal machine gunner. Additionally, two helicopter pilot acquaintances of Rhodes, Distinguished Flying Cross recipient Johnson and Charts, join the group. Former Force Recon Marine Kevin Scott joins the team and later turns out to be the son of a pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and listed as MIA. With the financial backing of good friend and rich oil businessman McGregor, whose son served in Frank's platoon and is also listed among the missing, the men train near Galveston, Texas in preparation to undertake a rescue mission at a remote POW camp in Laos. As the team arrives in Southeast Asia, the CIA, fearing an international crisis from Rhodes' actions, intercepts him in Bangkok and confiscates his weapons and equipment. Still determined to rescue their comrades, the team members put together their expense money given to them by McGregor to purchase replacement weapons and supplies. Rhodes contacts an acquaintance, deposed local drug baron Jiang, who joins the expedition with his two daughters Lai Fun and Mai Lin. Jiang manages to supply them with outdated but capable World War II-era weapons. In the course of the expedition, Charts gradually forms a relationship with Lai Fun. Near the Laotian border, the group is attacked by a border patrol unit and Mai Lin is killed. Later, the group divides: Rhodes leads Charts, Sailor, Johnson and Lai Fun as the \"air team\" to a helicopter compound to secure escape transportation, while Jiang, Blaster, Scott and Wilkes scout out the prison camp as the \"ground team.\"  The ground team later discovers four Americans among the prisoners, but are unable to ascertain Frank's whereabouts. The teams spend the night preparing before commencing the attack the next morning. Blaster sets up demolition charges, while Rhodes and his team discover that the air base is not where they expected it to be. Hiking through the jungle, they find it, get the choppers and take off, but are late in arriving at the camp. Blaster makes the decision to blow his charges to prevent the prisoners from leaving the camp, even though the choppers haven't arrived. In a heated battle, they manage to spring the prisoners, among them McGregor's son, but Frank is not among them; Blaster, Sailor and Jiang are killed in the process. From McGregor's son, Rhodes learns that Frank became ill soon after his capture and died. It is revealed that Frank was the soldier who stopped to carry a wounded McGregor during the platoon's evacuation to the helicopters in Vietnam in 1972 (as seen in the opening scene), but they were left behind as the helicopter carrying Blaster, Sailor and Wilkes departed the hot landing zone. Stateside, the group is joyously welcomed by their families with media attention and fanfare. Rhodes finds that in learning the fate of his son, he has gained some closure for his wife and himself."

        "content": "The film began with a screenplay by actor Wings Hauser, who says he was inspired by the stories of a childhood friend, Gary Dickerson, who had been to Vietnam. \"I saw that he had left something behind in Viet Nam and that triggered the whole thing,\" said Hauser. \"And then I became aware of the MIA and the POW situation and said well that will be the excuse to go back to Nam and gel the POWs, but what they\u2019re really going back for is their own clarity and their own integrity right? And that\u2019s the story. That\u2019s the whole film.\" Hauser says it took a 18 months to write the script which he sold to Paramount. The film had at least five title changes, including Last River to Cross. John Milius became attached to the producer. The script was rewritten by Joe Gayton. Hauser lost credit in arbitration. In 1989, the actor-writer said, \"John Milius is a scumbag right-wing bastard and I can\u2019t wait for his day to die! That son of a bitch! The (other) guy who got the credit, he was a punk! I don\u2019t think he\u2019s sold anything since and I have and he\u2019s a joke!\" Paramount sent Joe Gayton's script to director Ted Kotcheff late in January, 1983. The following month it came out that James Gritz (aka Bo Gritz), a former lieutenant-colonel in the Green Berets (and the man that both the characters Rambo and Hannibal Smith from The A-Team are based upon), had led a secret mission into Laos the previous November to search for MIA American soldiers which ended when they were ambushed by Laotian soldiers. Kotcheff said \"We assiduously avoided anything in our story similar to Gritz. Our research amazingly showed there were some 30 groups training for similar missions.\" Kotcheff said that Milius did write \"two or three scenes\" as well as making \"a number of very creative suggestions\" on the script. Among the scenes Milius wrote included one where Hackman gives a speech to the other soldiers about Vietnam being like a company that has gone bankrupt. \"It was a wonderful speech,\" said Kotcheff, adding Milius \"did write under pressure but mainly he functioned as a producer.\" Milius said he wanted James Arness to play the lead role rather than Gene Hackman."

        "content": "Cube is a Canadian science fiction horror film series. The films were directed by Vincenzo Natali, Andrzej Seku\u0142a, Ernie Barbarash and Yasuhiko Shimizu respectively. The films are centered, with slight variations, on the same science-fictional setting: a gigantic, mechanized cubical structure of unknown purpose and origin, made up of numerous smaller cubical rooms, in which most or all of the principal characters inexplicably awaken in the opening scenes. Each of these rooms has six heavy vault doors, one on each face of the cube, which lead into adjacent, largely identical rooms, differing occasionally by colour of lighting. Some of these rooms are \"safe\", while others are equipped with deadly booby traps such as flamethrowers and razorwire. In some cases it is possible to detect a trap by throwing an object into the room first, although this method is not always reliable due to the trigger mechanism of certain traps. In each case, a group of strangers awakens in this mysterious structure, without any knowledge of how or why they are there. In order to escape from the prison, they must band together and use their combined skills and talents to avoid the traps and navigate out of the maze, while also trying to solve the mystery of what the cube is and why they are in it. An American remake, currently on hold, is in development at Lionsgate, and a Japanese produced remake was released in 2021."

        "content": "The world in which the Cube series is set is kept secret from the viewer of the films throughout. The first Cube, in particular, portrays nothing of the world in which the film is set, who is responsible for the Cube, or why the prisoners are there. Hints are, however, given throughout the second and third films. The film's writer, Vincenzo Natali, apparently wrote a script detailing the world outside the Cube, but destroyed it after deciding not to create a movie about it. The plot devices used in Hypercube and Cube Zero (IZON and the government) are likely not (or only very loosely) related to Natali's original idea. The first film is especially most ominous about the outside world; there is no indication of where or when the Cube was built, nor the timeline of it (although it is generally assumed to be present day). Although the main characters are presumably North American due to their speaking English with typical North American accents, there is no evidence of the Cube built in the U.S. However, in the second film, a U.S. Colonel displays knowledge of the first Cube's existence and layout. The Colonel is referring to the Cube in the first movie and not the prequel because he mentions a feature specific to that Cube. The second film reveals that a company named IZON is responsible for the Cube. Several exterior shots indicate that it is set in present time. The Cube's disturbing nature and the sheer impossibility of it being a physical construct (since it is technically an endless tesseract) make the location ambiguous. Furthermore, IZON is a private company, but the presence of the aforementioned Colonel and his knowledge of the Cube suggests that the U.S government is involved, or are perhaps trying to take it down. The third Cube shows its personnel, consisting of management (known as \"people upstairs\") and technicians who operate the Cube and oversee the people placed inside. All people trapped in the Cube are death row inmates with their memories deleted and who willingly signed in to be placed inside instead of being executed. The Cube appears to be operated by a repressive, totalitarian government. At one point, when one technician finds no consent form of a woman trapped inside, it shows that the government also imprisons political opponents inside against their will (the technician finds her picture in a newspaper showing her at a political protest). It is also revealed in this movie that a character from the first movie, Kazan, may not actually be autistic, and was in fact Eric Wynn (or a victim of the same treatment Wynn received: having his brain surgically altered so his behaviour resembles that of a stereotypical autistic savant)."

Sam discusses his new patient, Henry, a college student and aspiring artist whom he describes as depressed and paranoid, with feelings of guilt and remorse. During Sam's first meeting with Henry, Henry mentions that he sometimes hears voices, and seems able to predict future events. Henry is also suspicious of Sam because his regular psychiatrist, Beth Levy, has suddenly taken leave. That night Sam attempts to call Beth but to no avail. The next day, Henry hints to Sam of his plans to kill himself that Saturday at midnight. Lila, who has survived a past suicide attempt, offers to help to dissuade Henry from killing himself. Henry disappears that night. Sam investigates Henry's circumstances and, after repeatedly attempting to reach Dr. Levy, comes to her apartment to find her disoriented and lethargic, mumbling incoherent phrases. Henry, who had earlier claimed his parents are dead, has his account contradicted by Sam when he finds Henry's mother and her dog living in a bare house, confused about Sam's identity and refusing to respond to his questions. Henry's mother's head starts bleeding and when Sam attempts to help her, her dog bites him. At the clinic, while having his dog-bitten arm treated, Sam discusses the visit with a present police officer who is curious as to why he would visit that house. Sam explains what happened, but the police officer tells him that he had attended the funeral for the woman who lived there several months ago. This seems to send Sam into a fugue in which the same scene and dialogue is repeated several times. Later, Sam contacts a waitress named Athena, with whom Henry has mentioned that he had fallen in love. She is an aspiring actress and he meets her at a script reading where she is reading lines from Hamlet with another man. She agrees to take him to Henry, but after a long trip down winding staircases he loses her. When he gets back to the rehearsal room, she is there reading the same lines as when he first encountered her. The search continues until 11:33 pm on Saturday, less than half an hour before Henry plans to kill himself. At a bookshop known to have been frequented by Henry, Sam finds a painting that Henry had painted and bartered for books about Henry's favorite artist. He learns that the artist killed himself on the Brooklyn Bridge on his twenty-first birthday. Henry's twenty-first birthday is Sunday, and Sam realizes that Henry plans to commit suicide on the Brooklyn Bridge in imitation of the artist. Sam finds Henry on the Brooklyn Bridge in a physical atmosphere that is increasingly unraveling. Sam admits to Henry that he doesn't know what is real anymore. Henry tells Sam that he is real, and he was just trying to help him. Henry tells Sam that he now knows the world is a dream, and shoots himself with his gun. The car crash of the first scene is then reprised. Henry was fatally wounded in the crash but, in his last moments, is suffering survivor guilt, thus spending his final moment in the dream in which the story occurred. Each of the characters introduced earlier in the film was in fact a random spectator at the site of the crash, including doctor Sam and nurse Lila, who treat Henry in an attempt to save him. The brief remarks they make are the same ones heard previously by their counterparts earlier. They fail to rescue Henry, and Henry dies, but not before seeing Lila as Athena and proposing to her, which Lila accepts out of sympathy. Sam asks Lila out for coffee, saying that he cannot sleep after what happened."

However, Boyd brings aboard Delaney (a man he has agreed to smuggle out of the country) and two henchmen. When Boyd demands that Delaney pay him \u00a3500, rather than \u00a3200, a fight erupts, and Boyd knocks Delaney out. A broken oil lamp starts a fire, attracting the attention of the authorities, and Philip is fished out of the water. A charred corpse is found in the sunken boat. The Drivers and Tim Pewsey perjure themselves by identifying the dead man as Boyd, rather than Delaney, and claiming there was no other man present. This leads to Philip's conviction for Boyd's murder. Granted leniency, he spends 12 years in prison. Upon his release, he sets out to get even with the witnesses. He is kept under surveillance by the police on the orders of Superintendent Bob Lowther, who is now married to Fay. Philip finds an abandoned barge claimed by Jackson, a kindly old hermit. His plan is to live rough on the barge while he searches for the witnesses. But three people attempt \u2013 initially unsuccessfully \u2013 to befriend him. First, Jackson withdraws an initial request for rent. Then Craig, a newspaperman who suspects him to be innocent, arrives; Philip throws him out, but Craig tumbles down an open hatch and is knocked unconscious, and Philip rescues him. Finally, he happens upon a sailor attempting to rape Ilse, a traumatised wartime refugee; when he rescues her and allows her to stay on the barge, she falls in love with him. Informed by Craig that Captain Driver had died four years earlier, Philip stalks Pewsey, with Lowther and Craig on his trail. Pewsey is frightened into confessing to Lowther that there was another man present at the murder. Now Lowther's marriage comes under increasing tension as he considers the possibility of his wife's perjury. Finally, she confesses she did lie to protect her father. Lowther tells her that she will have to turn herself in and he will have to resign. She asks for time, and goes to see \"George Berry\", who turns out to be Boyd. She asks him for money and they plan to leave the country together. Ilse pleads with Philip to give up his dream of revenge and start a new life with her. He confronts Fay in her home, realizes Ilse was right, and walks away. When Fay realises Boyd is not coming, she attempts suicide by trying to jump in front of an oncoming Waterloo & City line train, but is stopped by other people on the platform. She leaves with police sent by her husband after he read her farewell note. However, by sheer chance, Philip is then hired to deliver an urgent letter to \"Berry\". Philip confronts Boyd in his office, they fight, and then Philip stops fighting and walks away again. It is time for Boyd to meet Fay at London Waterloo railway station, but he pursues Philip and shoots him in the arm. Philip flees to the barge, but Boyd is waiting for him. After a chase, Boyd is about to kill Philip when he is shot dead by Jackson. Ilse and Philip refuse further help from the police, leaving to deal with their pasts and futures together."

Raymond Brock (Charles Dance) from the British Embassy arrives to oversee Radley's funeral, and consoles his widow, Susan. Sometime later at the embassy, Susan confesses to Raymond that she and Radley were not really married; they only posed as husband and wife during the war, and asks him to tell Radley's real wife that the man died while traveling alone. After returning to London for the first time in two years, Susan and Raymond begin a relationship, and he travels from his post in Belgium to visit her in England every weekend. Susan takes a job as a clerk in a small shipping firm in the East End. Susan's friend and colleague, the spunky 18-year-old Alice Park (Tracey Ullman), moves in with her, and they engage in a bohemian lifestyle, visiting nightclubs together. Susan is restless in her post-war life, and expresses frustration with her job at the shipping office. During the winter of 1945-1946, she quarrels with Raymond, and suggests they separate for the winter. Skipping forward to 1953, Susan is now working as a member of Queen Elizabeth's coronation committee. She has moved into a larger apartment, and Alice is still her roommate. One day, Susan asks one of Alice's former boyfriends and a fellow working-class lover, Mick (Sting), to father her child. He reluctantly agrees to conceive a child with her, but is discouraged that she would want to raise the baby without him. When her job in the coronation committee is done, Susan begins working in advertising, but leaves within months, finding the work unsatisfying. Over time, Mick tries to court Susan, but she refuses to consider having a real relationship with him. After 18 months of trying and failing to become pregnant, Susan ends their involvement which leads to a confrontation on New Year's Day in 1955 between her and Mick in her apartment which ends with Susan firing a gun above Mick's head to make him leave. Alice telephones Susan's former boyfriend, Raymond (who is still working in the diplomatic corps), to report that Susan has suffered a nervous breakdown. He arrives to visit her in the hospital, and in time, Raymond and Susan get married. In a jump-forward to November 1956, Susan remains frustrated with her life despite that she is married and now living in a smart house in the West End. Susan's unstable mental state becomes apparent to everyone, including Alice, when Susan is moody and is insulting to Raymond and their friends during a party attended by Sir Leonard Darwin (John Gielgud), this prompts Darwin to needlessly humiliate Mme Aung (Pik-Sen Lim) and then walk out of the party. Raymond then announces to everyone that Darwin is going to resign from his position due to Great Britain's disastrous involvement in the Suez Crisis. Skipping forward three or four years later, Susan and Raymond have moved to Jordan, where Raymond has been assigned a diplomatic post. Alice pays them a visit, and is alarmed by Susan's subdued demeanor. Although Susan claims to be happy, Alice questions her and Raymond about their sedate lifestyle, and worries how her friend could stay in Jordan for another two years. When word travels of the death of Raymond's colleague, Sir Leonard Darwin, Susan uses the excuse to return to England for the funeral, and Raymond blames Alice for putting the idea in Susan's head. Back in England, Susan insists they not return to Jordan. Sometime later in 1962, Susan meets Raymond's employer, Sir Andrew Charleson (Ian McKellen), and questions him about her husband's stagnant career, which she correctly interprets as a censure for his abandonment of the post in Jordan. This fact is subtly confirmed by Charleson. The meeting soon turns ugly when Susan threatens to commit suicide if Raymond does not receive a promotion within six days, which prompts Charleson to have Susan removed from the building. Raymond is immediately summoned to Charleson's office, who informs him of his wife's visit and threats, at the conclusion of which he is dismissed entirely from the Diplomatic Service and forced into early retirement. When the distraught and sombre Raymond returns home, he finds Susan decorating the house, seemingly oblivious to her actions earlier that day. Raymond insists Susan see a mental health practitioner, but she refuses and claims to have no idea what he means by that. As the couple argue, Susan slams a door in his face, and Raymond is knocked unconscious. She nurses his bloodied face before packing her things and leaving. Soon after, Susan rekindles her wartime love affair with Lazar, meeting him at a seaside hotel, after he had tracked her down after seeing her being interviewed on a TV program weeks earlier about her involvement in the war. After they make love, Susan shares her mental instability with Lazar. When she falls asleep, he leaves. In the final scene, Susan recalls her idealistic youth in the French countryside, following the end of the war where news about Germany's surrender reaches the French village where Susan is staying. Susan talks with a local French dairy farmer about the end of the war and agrees to accompany him to a party with his family in the village to celebrate the end of the conflict. In the ironic final shot, Susan proclaims: \"there will be days and days like this for many years to come!\""

        "content": "George Shuttleworth (Formby) is a chimney sweep from Wigan who dreams of winning the Isle of Man TT. Unfortunately, George's attempts to secure a factory ride with the Rainbow Motorcycle Company are unsuccessful and consequently he resorts to entering his own machine the \"Shuttleworth Snap\", a motorcycle derived from an old Rainbow machine. Whilst running the engine of his machine, George inadvertently knocks the motorcycle off its stand and crashes into the fence of his next door neighbour, Mr Hardacre, who goads George about his dream of winning the T.T. Undeterred, George asks his mother if she could lend him \u00a35 so he can make his way to the Isle of Man in order to compete at the races. Although unable to give him the \u00a35 directly, George's mother endeavours to take the money from his Grandpa's savings which he keeps concealed in the lining of the settee. With money 'borrowed' from his grandfather, George make his way by train to Liverpool and embarks on the steamer for Douglas. As he prepares to embark, George's attention is drawn to the arrival of the more famous T.T. competitors -such as Bert Tyldesley- who embarks onto the steamer with the secretary of boss of the Rainbow Motorcycle Company, Florrey Dibney (Florence Desmond). George attempts to be included in a photograph with Tyldesley and another T.T. rider -Norton-, but as they assemble for the photograph, George observes a stray cargo crate heading towards them. In order to save Florrie from being struck by the crate, George pushes her out of the way and consequently knocks her hat over the side of the ship. More concerned at the loss of her hat than the danger posed by the cargo crate, Florrie takes George to task, and he resolves to climb down the side of the ship to retrieve the hat. As George begins to descend the side of the ship on a rope, the order is given to cast off and the deck hands begin to haul in the rope just as George reaches the ship's side belting. Holding onto the very end of the rope, it is suddenly hauled up and George falls into the water. Evading the rivals who have paid him not to compete, George makes it to the start with seconds to spare. He drives like fury, and most of his rival drivers are knocked out by crashes or blown engines. With yards to go, his bike conks out and he pushes it over the line to win; a split-second ahead of his fellow rider. So he not only succeeds in winning the race, but gets the girl as well."

        "content": "D, known in Japan as  or D's Diner, is a horror-themed interactive movie and adventure game developed by Warp and directed by Kenji Eno. It was first published by Panasonic for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1995, later being ported to the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and MS-DOS. The story follows Laura Harris as she goes to investigate a hospital after learning her father went on a mass murdering spree and barricaded himself inside. The hospital morphs into a castle upon her arrival, which she must explore to find her father. The player controls Laura through computer generated full-motion video (FMV) sequences, and must complete the game within two hours without a save or pause function. Development lasted about one year and was primarily done with Amiga 4000 computers to create the FMVs. It would be the first major release for the still-unknown Eno and Warp, and so Eno felt that if it were not successful he would quit from game development. He added scenes of violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking, however he believed the content would be too extreme for censors or publishers and feared the game would not be permitted for publishing. To ensure these scenes would not be censored, Eno submitted a \"clean\" version for late publisher approval, knowing they would require him to deliver the game to the manufacturer. On his way to the manufacturer, he switched the clean version with his master version containing the more disturbing content. The game was a commercial and critical success in Japan, selling a million copies and receiving a special edition re-release. Critics in the West praised D's horror elements, story, graphics, and presentation. Reviewers of the 3DO version found it to be one of the best games on the platform. For the PlayStation release, Sony did not print enough copies to match pre-orders. Eno was very upset with this, and would later take revenge on Sony by releasing his later games exclusively on Sega platforms. Warp dubbed the CG model for Laura Harris a \"digital actress\" and had \"her\" play different characters in two later games, Enemy Zero (1996) and D2 (1999), the stories for which are unrelated to D. Modern retrospectives find D less appealing, but still commend it for its place in history as a unique blend of cinema and gaming and an early example of mature horror game design."

        "content": "D is an interactive movie which features adventure game elements, a horror genre storyline, and heavy use of full motion video. The player takes on the role of Laura Harris, played by a \"digital actress\" named Laura that appears in games by Warp, although the stories are unrelated. The player directs Laura's movements as she explores the game's environment, solves puzzles, and unravels the story. The movements occur through FMV sequences as she walks to the desired location, from where the player is greeted with a static screen which may contain items they can interact with or other paths to direct Laura. There is no save or pause function, and after two real-time hours, the other world will be closed off and Laura will be pulled back to the real world, ending the game. Depending on the player's actions, there are different endings. Taking place in 1997, the story begins when Laura Harris is contacted by Los Angeles police, receiving a disturbing message: her father, Dr. Richter Harris, director of the Los Angeles National Hospital, has gone on a mass murdering spree and barricaded himself in the hospital. Laura rushes to the scene of the crime, desperate to find an explanation for the well-respected doctor's actions. Upon entering the hospital, she is so horrified at the murdered bodies lying about the halls that she covers her eyes. When she uncovers them again, she finds herself in an unknown medieval castle. Unwilling to give up her search, Laura continues through the dark corridors of the castle. While attempting to find her father, she experiences a series of flashbacks of her mother being stabbed to death. Laura's father (taking the form of apparitions) warns her to leave, saying that staying too long means being stuck in the alternate reality forever. He warns that he will soon become an emotionless monster and will eventually try to kill her. Still shaken, Laura proceeds to find her father. Ultimately, Laura finds her father residing at the peak tower of the castle. He reveals the sordid past of his family: Laura and her father are part of a bloodline of cannibalistic vampires, dating back to the infamous Dracula. Driven by her vampiric urges, Laura killed and ate her mother years ago, but it was erased from her memory by her father. As Dr. Harris demands Laura to leave one last time, he begins to transform into a vampire. If the player approaches Dr. Harris at this point, he will consume Laura's flesh and fully transform. However, if the player shoots Dr. Harris with a revolver that can be found earlier in the game, the bullet will kill him and stop his transformation. As Laura tearfully cradles her dying father in her arms, he confesses that he allowed the transformation to occur out of scientific curiosity and thanks her for stopping him. With his death, the realm created by his mind fades and is replaced by the normal surroundings of the hospital."

        "content": "Development of D lasted about one year and was directed by Warp president Kenji Eno. Eno was heavily inspired by Polarware's Transylvania adventure game series and he believes D would have never been created if it were not for playing those games. Eno and Warp were still relatively unknown in the industry, and D would be their first major title. With this in mind, Eno felt that he was gambling his development career on D, and if it were not successful he would stop developing games. There were three phases to D'''s development: the adventure game structure, the story creation, and finally violence was added. Since the adventure gameplay was largely finished before the story began to take fruition, flashbacks were added to detail the plot. The plot was largely based on that of Dracula, but Eno found it too boring, and so added violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking. The FMVs were created using Amiga 4000s. Eno believed D's violent cannibalistic themes would be deemed taboo or too horrifying by others and was worried the game would not be permitted for publishing. With this in mind, Eno kept many of the violent sequences a secret, including from other members of Warp. When the game was finished, he submitted a \"clean\" version (i.e. without the violent and disturbing story content) for approval. He deliberately submitted the master late, knowing that part of the penalty would require him to hand-deliver it to the manufacturers in the United States. While on the plane ride to the US, he switched the \"clean\" discs with the finalized discs including the horrific content, thus completely bypassing all censorship.D was a success in Japan. In total it sold one million copies there and the Saturn version reached the top of the sales charts in its first week. It was one of the few genuine hits for the 3DO in Japan, and drew a significant cult following of hardcore fans even before being ported to other systems. A Japanese re-release for the 3DO titled D's Diner: Director's Cut contained additional content and a bonus soundtrack disc. The PlayStation release of D was set to be published by Acclaim and manufactured by Sony. Orders for around 100,000 units had already been made before Sony decided to give their other titles manufacturing priority. Sony told Eno they had only manufactured 40,000 units, which made Eno very upset, but ultimately, Sony had only manufactured 28,000 units. This shortage upset Eno so much that he later announced, at a Sony event, that he would release his next games for the Sega Saturn. Warp's later games, including Enemy Zero (1996) and D2 (1999), were released exclusively on Sega platforms."

It focuses on a deaf teenage orphan who is sent to live with her godparents. She soon becomes a sounding board for the family members, who confess their darkest secrets to her, including the incestous relationship between her godfather and his teenage daughter. The second feature film by Babbit after the 1999 comedy But I'm a Cheerleader, The Quiet was shot in Austin, Texas in 2004, the first film by the University of Texas's Burnt Orange production company. Cuthbert served as an associate producer of the film. Its soundtrack features songs by Low, Cat Power, Le Tigre, and numerous Beethoven piano sonatas. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival before being acquired by Destination Films, who released it in the United States theatrically through Sony Pictures Classics in August 2005. The film was ultimately a commercial success, but many critics at the time of its release dismissed it as sleazy, exploitative, and difficult to watch, with several noting that it was too serious to be satire, yet too campy to be taken seriously."

        "content": "Following the accidental death of her deaf father, Dot, an orphaned teenager who is also deaf-mute, is sent to live in Connecticut with her godparents, Paul and Olivia Deer, and their teenaged daughter, Nina. Dot and Nina had been friends in childhood, before Dot lost her hearing as a result of a medical condition. The aloof Nina resents Dot's presence in the home and insults her repeatedly. Meanwhile, Dot observes that Olivia, an unfulfilled interior designer who was close friends with Dot's mother, is an alcoholic with a prescription drug addiction. Late one night, while returning to her bedroom, Dot observes Paul and Nina having sex in Nina's bedroom, unbeknownst to them. It becomes clear that Nina and Paul have had a years-long incestuous relationship, which Nina uses as leverage against her father to get whatever she wants. At school, Dot is a social outcast, though Connor, a basketball player, takes an interest in her, much to the chagrin of Nina's abrasive friend, Michelle, who is pursuing him. One afternoon, Nina returns home early from cheerleading practice and overhears Dot playing Beethoven on the family's piano. When one of the strings breaks, Nina hears Dot swear loudly, before vocally harmonizing with the strings as she tunes them. Realizing Dot is neither deaf nor mute, Nina withholds her knowledge of this. At lunch the next day, acting under the guise that Dot cannot hear, Nina assays her by confessing her hatred of her father, and details her plan to murder him. That evening, Dot goes on a date with Connor, who is able to communicate with her by lip reading. Dot returns home to find Paul and Nina in bed together, and deliberately breaks a vase in the hallway, interrupting their rendezvous; Nina realizes the action signifies Dot's alliance with her. Later, Dot comforts Nina in her bedroom as she cries herself to sleep. The following night, after a basketball game, Connor confides numerous personal secrets to Dot, including his attention deficit disorder and his chronic masturbation. The two proceed to have sex in the school swimming pool. Meanwhile, Nina returns home from the game and is visited by Paul in her bedroom while she irons her cheerleading uniform. Mustering the courage to proceed with the murder, Nina tells him to close his eyes, and that she has a secret to show him; she proceeds to approach him with the hot iron to burn his face, but is interrupted when Dot returns home. Nina puts the iron down, and instead lies to her father that she is pregnant and needs a thousand dollars for an abortion. He agrees to give Nina the money the next day. Nina and Dot prepare to attend the school's spring dance the following night. While getting ready, Nina tells Dot she is going to kill Paul that night and run away with the abortion money he is giving her. She explains that she will find work as a stripper, believing she can become famous \"like Courtney Love.\" Before the girls depart for the dance, Paul confronts Nina after finding tampons in her purse, and accuses her of lying about the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Dot, who is playing \"Moonlight Sonata\" downstairs, hears the argument. The confrontation becomes violent, and eventually descends into a rape before Dot comes to Nina's defense, strangling Paul to death with a piano wire. Olivia, in a drug-induced stupor, stumbles upon the scene, unfazed by her husband's corpse, but amazed by the revelation that Dot can hear. Michelle arrives at the house to pick Nina and Dot up. The two quickly change their dresses, which are soaked in blood, and leave. At the dance, Dot reveals to Connor that she can hear and speak; angered by her deception, he storms away. Nina and Dot leave the dance, and walk to a riverbank in the woods, where they bury a backpack containing their blood-soaked clothing. Nina asks Dot why she pretended to be deaf and mute. Dot explains that, after her mother died during her childhood, she stopped speaking and began communicating only with sign language, as it made her feel closer to her father. When the girls return home, they find police cars at the house, and Olivia turning herself in for Paul's murder. Olivia apologizes to her daughter, and atones for having allowed Paul's sexual abuse of Nina go ignored. The following morning, Nina and Dot sit together and play piano, freed from their respective fathers."

The characters include John Casey (Anthony Hopkins), a retired hotel doorman who spends his days in the lobby playing chess with his friend Nelson (Harry Belafonte); Diane (Lindsay Lohan), who is marrying her friend William (Elijah Wood) with the hope his marital status will have him deployed to a military base in Germany rather than the battlefields of Vietnam when his tour of duty begins; Virginia Fallon (Demi Moore), an alcoholic singer whose career is on the downswing, her put-upon husband/manager Tim (Emilio Estevez), and her agent Phil (David Krumholtz); Miriam Ebbers (Sharon Stone), a beautician who works in the hotel salon, and her husband Paul (William H. Macy), the hotel manager, who is having an affair with switchboard operator Angela (Heather Graham); food and beverage manager Daryl Timmons (Christian Slater), whose racist attitude gets him fired; African American sous chef Edward Robinson (Laurence Fishburne) and Mexican American busboys Jos\u00e9 (Freddy Rodriguez) and Miguel (Jacob Vargas); hotel coffee shop waitress Susan (Mary Elizabeth Winstead); Jimmy (Brian Geraghty) and Cooper (Shia LaBeouf), campaign volunteers who are sidetracked by an acid trip they take with the help of drug dealer Fisher (Ashton Kutcher); married socialites and campaign donors Samantha (Helen Hunt) and Jack (Martin Sheen); campaign manager Wade (Joshua Jackson) and staffer Dwayne (Nick Cannon), who is in love with Angela's colleague, Patricia (Joy Bryant); and Czechoslovakian reporter Lenka Jan\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 (Svetlana Metkina), who is determined to get an interview with Kennedy. At the end of the film, Kennedy is shot after giving his acceptance speech. A man named Sirhan Sirhan would be convicted of the killing. After being shot, Kennedy is cradled and protected by Jose until help arrives. As Kennedy's speech \"On the Mindless Menace of Violence\", delivered in 1968 to the City Club of Cleveland, Ohio, is played over the aftermath, it is revealed that Samantha, Daryl, Cooper, Jimmy and William are among those injured by Sirhan's wild firing. Sirhan is apprehended, while Kennedy is rushed into an ambulance (as are the others eventually), and everyone else is moved by the events that have just taken place. Closing titles reveal that Kennedy died of his injuries the following morning with his wife Ethel at his side, and the other victims of the shooting survived."

Bucum manages to tackle Lil J's girlfriend and arrest Lil J. Bucum's boss Martinez (Anthony Giaimo), however, is not pleased with Bucum and pays him less than expected. After a brief conversation about the lottery with his attractive co-worker Pam (Valarie Rae Miller), Bucum learns from Martinez that he must capture a con man named Reggie Wright (Mike Epps), whom Bucum has captured three times prior. Bucum sees Reggie at a convenience store but fails to catch him after a long chase through Miami. Meanwhile, during a photoshoot, diamond thieves Julian (Roger Guenveur Smith) and Ursula (Carmen Chaplin) are posing as a photographer and model until a Mr. Barkley arrives. The duo murder the co-photographer, the makeup artist and Barkley's bodyguards, much to Barkley's surprise. Barkley is then shot in the head after a brief dialogue with Julian for murdering the witnesses. They then retrieve diamonds from the shoot. Bucum tracks down Reggie again and chases him until he remains unnoticed since he is hidden in a van. The thieves comes down, upon running into him instantly by accident, shoots at Bucum, who shoots back in response, and escapes, unbeknownst  to them that Reggie is hidden. In a boatyard, the thieves finds Reggie in the van and shoot at him when he escapes, leaving his wallet behind, which is picked up by Julian. At the crime scene, Martinez is fed up of Bucum's attempts and orders him to stay away from Reggie.

In the boatyard, Julian and Ursula are yelled at by their boss Williamson (Tommy Flanagan), having told him that the diamonds they retrieved from the shoot were fake. Out of frustration of not getting the diamonds, Williamson responds by shooting Julian in the arm, severely wounding him, which is later enclosed in an arm brace. Reggie is soon captured by Bucum during an attempt to retrieve his wallet and while in the car, Reggie manages to convince Bucum to find his wallet and find the thieves.

The duo then decides to torture Julian for answers by bending a screwdriver into Julian's arm brace, which can rip through his skin. Julian then reveals Williamson's name. Bucum awaits in the boatyard of Williamson's boat dealership and poses as a customer. This soon fails, so the duo decides to go to the Barkley residence. At the house, they find a dead Mrs. Barkley, a man named Roscoe who was the one who murdered Mrs. Barkley, surprises and knocks out  Bucum (only to be knocked out by Reggie),  eventually finding the diamonds in a fish tank, and putting Roscoe in the trunk of Bucum\u2019s car bound and gagged, along with Julian. They return to Bucum's apartment and discover that Williamson has kidnapped Gina. In response, they roll a car into Williamson's boat dealership with Julian and Roscoe unconscious in the cab.  Willamson finds a tape recorder that informs him to meet Reggie and Bucum at a dog track with Gina to exchange for the diamonds. This goes successful with Pam posing as a janitor, Reggie revealing the diamonds, and Bucum taking position as sniper in a dog tracksman disguise to take out a sniper working for Williamson until Reggie flips the diamonds off of Williamson's hands leading to a shootout and chase. During the chase, Williamson pulls out a bazooka and opens fire, missing Bucum, Reggie, Gina and Pam but instead blowing up a nearby fish truck. He escapes, and Bucum and Reggie are so fed up with the plan that they decide to break up their partnership . Pam convinces Bucum to talk to Reggie and they make up again. The duo tracks Williamson to a boat dock in which Gina and Pam await behind them in the car. Bucum gives Reggie a taser since Reggie accidentally dropped one of Bucum's guns into the ocean. On the boat, as Bucum leaves, he sees Pam and Gina running away, having knocked out two henchman by pushing a lifeboat in their direction. Meanwhile, Reggie finds his wallet and recovers the lottery ticket, but is soon caught by Williamson and Ursula and he even forces Reggie to take his money on the boat. Bucum, taking Ursula as a hostage, catches up with them. Williamson, in response, kills Ursula by shooting her in the head and wounds Reggie, leading to a fight as the boat speeds up. Williamson is knocked out by the boat's speed and the boat crashes onto shore. Bucum and Reggie reunite until Williamson, badly injured, attacks Bucum. Reggie tases him and Bucum shoots Williamson to death multiple times. Later, Bucum and Reggie are figuring out what to do next but the coast guards are coming, and Bucum is forced to handcuff Reggie and hide the money. Six weeks later, Reggie is released from prison. He initially believes that his friends have abandoned him until Bucum finally arrives, along with Gina and Pam. Bucum, who has a new car and spending money, reveals the winning ticket. The film ends with Reggie celebrating his new wealth with Bucum, their women, and the two elderly friends of Reggie, skiing on the boat through the ocean."

The episode was written by Joe Menosky and Ronald D. Moore and was the directorial debut of cast member Patrick Stewart. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the  Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Data (Brent Spiner) accepts the affections of shipmate Jenna D'Sora (Michele Scarabelli) and pursues a romantic relationship with her. However, Jenna soon comprehends the downside of a \"programmed\" relationship. As the couple attempts to work out their problems, the Enterprise moves into an area of space rendered deadly by a nebula that is tearing small gaps in the fabric of space, deforming any matter that comes into contact with them. \"In Theory\" received Nielsen ratings of 9.8 percent, making it the second least viewed episode of the fourth season on first broadcast. Reviewers were ambivalent about the episode. They criticized elements of the plot, such as the choice of Captain Jean-Luc Picard to pilot a shuttle in a subplot instead of an experienced shuttle pilot, and felt that Data's romance was ineffective. Keith DeCandido had the view that it was a re-hash of the second season episode \"The Dauphin\"."

D'Sora explains that she just split up with her boyfriend and Data attempts to comfort her. Later they play together in a chamber concert along with Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao). D'Sora complains of her abilities as a musician, but Data insists that he could not hear anything wrong. Later on the bridge, Data is reviewing the information from the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that life might have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on the cheek and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin with a bunch of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is approaching the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings scattered on the floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled in one corner of the room. Data is visiting D'Sora, but she seems unhappy and he is acting erratically in order to find an appropriate response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time to move out of the way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone. Picard pilots the shuttle through the field of distortion pockets. Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) transports the Captain back to the ship before the shuttle is destroyed. The approach resulted in the Enterprise nearing the edge of the nebula, and they quickly depart. Afterwards, D'Sora reveals to Data over a romantic dinner in his quarters that she broke up with her boyfriend because he was emotionally unavailable and then pursued him because he was the same. Data realises that she is breaking up with him and explains that he will delete the subroutine. D'Sora departs and Data is seemingly unperturbed, although his cat, Spot, jumps into his lap as if to comfort him."

Unknown to the intruders, Commander Tucker is still conscious and makes his way to Engineering and uses the ship's sensors to monitor the aliens as they plunder the ship. The Ferengi awaken Captain Archer and demand to know where he keeps his valuables. The Captain refuses to help and tells the Ferengi they have no money or latinum on board, so he is confined to a cargo bay. The aliens are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no valuable materials. They set off to find the vault themselves, leaving Krem and Archer to transfer the loot. Archer sees Tucker and sends him to the launch-bay to retrieve the Ferengi's hypospray. Doing so, Tucker revives Sub-Commander T'Pol. She deduces that the gas device was intentionally left as a 'Trojan Horse'. In Sickbay, three of the four Ferengi search for the non-existent vault, and T'Pol uses a PADD to distract and then start an argument between them. In Engineering, Archer tries to negotiate with Krem, who is tempted when Archer says that he will throw in T'Pol. Muk goes to the launch-bay and finds Tucker, who escapes, but Ulis subdues him with his electro-whip. The Ferengi, Archer and Trip meet in the launch-bay where Archer plays along with Tucker's deception about \"the vault\". T'Pol assists in subduing the intruders, and the crew oversee the return of the stolen goods. Archer tells the Ferengi not to go within a light year of a human or Vulcan vessel ever again (and they indeed do not reappear until some 200 years later in the episode The Last Outpost)."

Although they had been seen before on screen in previous incarnations of Star Trek, including throughout Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, a spoken language had not been developed. The pair wrote the dialogue initially in English, before translating it into French and then breaking it down into syllables. They described it as \"fun to write\". The pair had intended for the Ferengi throughout the episode to speak their new language, but this was reduced to only the first act. This was the third episode written by the duo, after \"Breaking the Ice\" and \"Dear Doctor\". Story editor Andr\u00e9 Bormanis explained in a web chat just before the airing of the episode that they had sought to ensure that Jean-Luc Picard was Captain who made first contact with the Ferengi officially; Bormanis commented that he thought the episode was funny. The Ferengi made their first appearance in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"The Last Outpost\", having been developed by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry and producer Herbert Wright. The events of the episode \"The Battle\" established that it was Picard on board the USS Stargazer at the Battle of Maxia that made the official first contact with the race on behalf of the Federation. Director James Whitmore, Jr. had directed episodes of 24, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Roswell, The X-Files and many other shows. He occasionally acts in the episodes he directs, and he appeared in several episodes of Quantum Leap starring Scott Bakula, of which he directed 15 episodes. Whitmore also directed the season 2 episode \"Future Tense\". The guest cast featured three former Star Trek alumni including Clint Howard who had appeared in the original Star Trek episode \"The Corbomite Maneuver\" as Balok. Ethan Phillips had appeared as Neelix, a main cast character in Star Trek: Voyager, as well as the Ferengi doctor Farek in The Next Generation episode \"M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Troi\". The third alumnus was Jeffrey Combs who had appeared as several characters such as Weyoun and the Ferengi Brunt in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Combs had already appeared in Enterprise as the Andorian Shran, and would continue to do so for the rest of the series. He said that being asked to appear as a Ferengi once again took him by surprise, but that Krem was \"a world's away\" from the Brunt character, which pleased him."

The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, CIA file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in Istanbul. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet woman named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a KGB spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \"Condorman\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \"Condorman\" be the agent that helps her. Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \"Laser Lady\". He is then notified by Harry and his boss Russ that he is to escort a defecting Soviet agent known as \"The Bear\". Woody refuses to do the job, but  when Russ reveals that \"The Bear\" is Natalia, he agrees to do it on the condition that the CIA provides him with gadgetry based on his designs. Woody meets up with Natalia in Yugoslavia and protects her from Krokov's henchmen led by the homicidal, glass-eyed assassin Morovich. After joining Harry in Italy, the trio venture to Switzerland, where Natalia discovers the truth about Woody when a group of children recognize her from his comic books. Their journey back to France is compromised when Morovich puts Woody and Harry out of commission and Krokov's men recover Natalia before retreating to their headquarters in Monte Carlo. Woody is told that the mission is a failure and he and Harry are ordered to return to Paris, but Woody asks Harry for two more days to conduct an operation to rescue Natalia. Disguising themselves as Arab sheiks, Woody and Harry create a diversion at the Monte Carlo Casino to recover Natalia from Krokov and his men. As Harry drives away in a Rolls-Royce, Woody uses an improved version of his Condorman suit to fly himself and Natalia out of the casino and onto the pier, where the trio make their getaway aboard the Condorboat. They manage to destroy Krokov's speedboats following them, but Krokov and Morovich pursue them in their own speedboat. The Condorboat reaches its pick-up point, but Morovich shows his intent on ramming it. When Morovich ignores his commander's orders to return to base, Krokov abandons ship. The Condorboat is lifted by the CIA helicopter in time to prevent a collision, causing Morovich to crash on an island rock. Days later, Woody, Natalia and Harry are at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, where they see the Goodyear Blimp flash a sign welcoming Natalia to the U.S. Aboard the blimp, Russ contacts Harry and has him ask Woody if he is interested in taking Condorman to another assignment."

She grows aggressive in demeanor, and propositions her dissertation advisor for sex at her apartment, afterward stealing money from his wallet while he sleeps. Jean, a doctoral candidate in Kathleen's cohort, notices a rapid change in Kathleen's personality. During finals week in the library, Kathleen meets a female anthropology student. The two go to the woman's apartment to study, where Kathleen bites her neck. While the young woman weeps incredulously, Kathleen coldly informs her: \"My indifference is not the concern here, it's your astonishment that needs studying\". Later, Kathleen runs into an acquaintance, who goes by the street name \"Black,\" at a deli. She propositions him for sex and the two leave, but soon attacks him on an empty street and drinks his blood. Later on campus, Kathleen confronts Jean, rambling about the nature of guilt, before proceeding to bite her neck and drink her blood. While walking on the street, Kathleen meets Peina, a vampire who claims to have almost conquered his addiction and as a result is almost human. For a time he keeps her in his home trying to help her overcome hers, recommending she read William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch. Later, Kathleen defends her dissertation to a committee, and is awarded her Doctorate of Philosophy. At the department's graduation party, she and Jean feast on the blood of a waitress in a storage closet. Afterwards, she, Casanova, Jean and some of Kathleen's other victims proceed to attack the other attendees in a bloody, chaotic orgy. Kathleen, apparently overdosed from the bloody bacchanal and looking wracked with regret, wanders the streets. She ends up in a hospital and asks the nurse to let her die, but the nurse refuses. Kathleen decides to commit suicide by asking the nurse to open the curtains. After the nurse leaves, Casanova appears in Kathleen's hospital room, shuts the curtains, and quotes R. C. Sproul to her. Next, a Catholic priest visits Kathleen's room and agrees to administer Viaticum. In the final scene, Kathleen visits her own grave, in broad daylight. In voice-over, Kathleen quotes: \"self-revelation is annihilation of self.\""

Ferrara stated in a 2018 interview that he intended the film to be an explicit metaphor for drug addiction; Ferrara himself had had a years-long addiction to heroin, and conceptualized the film as a Catholic redemption tale in which Kathleen, stricken by her lust for blood, accepts her powerlessness and submits to God before being reborn in the conclusion."

He and his wife, Anne, have all the trappings of success, although Jack works such long hours that he rarely has time to see their son and has become somewhat emotionally dead to his wife. His \"bedside manner\" with his patients, in many cases seriously ill, is also lacking. The decorum in the operating theater is very casual and the chatter between him and his partner, Dr. Murray Kaplan, not particularly professional. (When a patient with a chest scar mentions her husband wants to know if it will go away, Jack responds that she should tell him that she is just like a \"Playboy centerfold, because she has the staple marks to prove it.\") Returning home from a charity event, Jack has a coughing fit. His wife is shocked when he coughs up blood all over her and the car. In an examination, Jack has a sample of a growth removed from his throat. The biopsy comes back positive for cancer. His time spent with another cold, impersonal surgeon in this examination is the beginning of his transformation. Further tests and disappointments are blended with scenes of other patients' grace and empathy towards each other and a much better view of the delays and missteps of their doctors and medical support personnel. As Jack experiences life as a patient, he gains a clearer understanding of the emotional void hospitals, some doctors, and his own colleagues can display. He befriends June Ellis, a fellow cancer patient who has an inoperable brain tumor. She gets him to promise to never lie or mislead a patient again. Jack begins to bark at the medical establishment. Jack and June take off to see a Native American show, but the pace is too much for her. His wife, meanwhile, struggles to understand Jack's relationship with June. Jack's radiation treatment does not stop the cancer on his vocal cords. His despair ends in a confrontation with Dr. Leslie Abbott, the surgeon treating him whom he provokes in a heated discussion. Jack asks a colleague he has previously ridiculed, Dr. Eli Bloomfield, to perform his needed surgery. Jack apologizes for his and Murray's insulting behavior, to which Eli replies with a smile, \"Well, Jack, I've always wanted to slit your throat, and now I've got the chance.\" Eli's bedside manner is a perfect example for Jack. Jack's cancer is treated and cured, but June dies. The experience changes Jack forever. When he returns to work, he begins to teach new medical interns about the importance of showing compassion and sensitivity towards their patients, which in turn will make them better doctors. Jack puts the interns in patient gowns, assigns them various illnesses and orders all the tests for them to \"feel\" the experience that they will soon put their patients through."

In Taipei, she is a local girl suffering from a broken heart and he is a Japanese visitor she asks in the middle of the night to help putting up a wall unit.

But when he gets a postcard from the girlfriend ending their relationship, her attraction to him intensifies, although she never reveals it. This is the most poignant of the three stories.

Baron Frankenstein's daughter Tania (Rosalba Neri) arrives from school, having completed her studies in medicine, and is greeted by her father and his young servant, the handsome but mildly intellectually disabled Thomas (Marino Mas\u00e9).  Tania reveals to her father that she has always understood his work with \"animal transplants\" to be a cover for his work reanimating corpses, and that she intends to follow in his footsteps and help him in his work. The next day, Frankenstein, Tania, and Marshall witness the execution of a criminal who is hanged down a well, Frankenstein and Marshall both have an eye toward harvesting the criminal's body for their experimentation. Law enforcement agent Captain Harris (Mickey Hargitay) arrives to harass Lynch at the hanging.  Harris claims to be on to Lynch's grave robbing. That evening, having harvested salient body parts, Frankenstein and Marshall successfully reanimate a gruesome giant corpse with a scarred, misshapen head (Peter Whiteman) as Tania secretly watches. Almost instantly, however, this monster bear-hugs Frankenstein to death - breaking his back - then walks out of the castle. Tania and Marshall report the murder to Harris, but claim that it was a burglar. Harris points out that according to their description, the burglar would be over seven feet tall. The monster, roaming the countryside, comes across a couple having sex out in the open, and after scaring away the man, picks up the woman, who screams and then faints. The monster then carries her later body and drops it into a river, and when the body is later found by two men, the monster kills one by breaking his neck. After Harris questions Lynch, and Lynch refuses Tania's offer for more grave-robbing work, the monster breaks into Lynch's home while he is having sex with a local whore, and kills Lynch by beating him to death. The monster then kills a local farmer and his wife, and Lynch's two grave-robbing friends. Tania then goads Marshall into admitting harboring romantic feelings for her. She responds to his affections, but says that while Marshall's body is old, she finds the body of Thomas young and attractive. The \"solution\" to this situation will be to transplant Marshall's brilliant brain into the brain-damaged Thomas's young healthy body. To accomplish this, Tania seduces Thomas into having sex while Marshall secretly watches, and Marshall kills him with a pillow during their lovemaking. Tania then successfully transplants Marshall's brain into Thomas' body. Thomas now speaks with Marshall's voice and his body has become inhumanly strong as well. Meanwhile, Frankenstein's monster has continued to terrorize the town, and the local villagers, having had enough, arrive with torches and pitchforks before following the monster to the castle. In the chaos, the monster returns, knocks down Harris, and has a fight with Marshall/Thomas, who cuts off his arm. When the monster bear-hugs Marshall/Thomas, Tania stabs him in the back with a sword, and Marshall/Thomas kills him by puncturing his head open with a metal hand tool. The monster is defeated, but Tania has made it clear that she has no allegiance to Marshall. The villagers storm into the castle and set it aflame in the hopes of killing the monster. Harris arrives with Thomas's sister Julia (Renate Kasch\u00e9) to see Tania and Marshall/Thomas naked and enjoying post-fight sexual intercourse as the castle burns beside them. However, during their lovemaking, Marshall/Thomas begins to choke Tania as the flames consume them."

        "content": "Mel Welles was originally approached by Vanderbilt family member Henry Cooke Cushing IV with a screenplay titled Lady Dracula; Cushing was determined to produce a film starring actress Rosalba Neri, whom he was romantically pursuing. Recalling the film's development and their relationship, Welles recalled that Neri \"was turning him down, everywhere. She couldn't actually stand him; Harry was actually quite good-looking, but he was a pain in the neck because he had never lived in the real world \u2015 and that's what she resented about him. He never worked a day in his life. So here, in my lap, he dropped the script and the money to do it. What a windfall!\". Upon discovering that the rights to the Lady Dracula script were actually held by actor Brad Harris, Welles wrote a new screenplay with his friend, television writer Edward di Lorenzo, which was completed in three weeks; Welles also desired to incorporate feminist themes into the narrative. Film historian Roberto Curti has suggested that their script may have been inspired by \"For the Love of Frankenstein\", a story by Bill Warren and Jack Sparling that had appeared in the fourth issue of the comic book Vampirella. Welles was assisted by fellow expatriate producer Dick Randall in assembling the remainder of the cast, which included Joseph Cotton and Mickey Hargitay. $90,000 of Lady Frankensteins budget was originally intended to be provided through a letter of credit given to Welles by producer Skip Steloff, which was denied by the Italian banks shortly prior to the start of production. The money needed to make the film was eventually secured by Welles' old colleague Roger Corman; as part of this arrangement, Corman's distribution company New World Pictures gained the film's American distribution rights. According to Randall, the film's low budget, estimated to be less than $200,000, resulted in Cotton's schedule being shortened to two weeks and his part being rewritten so that his character's death would take place earlier in the film. Principal photography began on March 1, 1971, with most interiors being shot at De Paolis Studios in Rome, while several castle scenes were filmed at Castello Piccolomini. Aureliano Luppi was credited as the film's director on the Italian Public Cinematographic Register. Reflecting on the shoot, Neri stated that \"For a number of reasons \u2014 not sentimental ones, anyway \u2014 I used to go around with [Welles], his wife and children. Frankly, I don't think of him as a great director; on that film was a talented cameraman, Riccardo Pallottini, who did everything by himself \u2014 those nice lightings, for instance... he used to place the camera, then he waited for the director; he also solved technical problems and so forth\"."

        "content": "The Stand, alternatively known as Stephen King's The Stand, is a 1994 American television post-apocalyptic miniseries based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Stephen King. King also wrote the teleplay and has a minor role in the series. It was directed by Mick Garris, who previously directed the original King screenplay/film Sleepwalkers (1992). In order to satisfy expectations from King fans and King himself, The Stand is a mostly faithful adaptation to the original book, with only minor changes to material that would otherwise have not met broadcast standards and practices, and in order to keep ABC content. The Stand includes a cast of more than 125 speaking roles and features Gary Sinise, Miguel Ferrer, Rob Lowe, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Jamey Sheridan, Laura San Giacomo, Molly Ringwald, Corin Nemec, Adam Storke, Ray Walston, Ed Harris, and Matt Frewer. The miniseries was shot in several locations and on 225 sets. Each episode was given a $6 million budget so to reduce cost, the miniseries was shot on 16mm film. The Stand originally aired on ABC from May 8 to May 12, 1994. Reviews were positive and the miniseries was nominated for six Primetime Emmy Awards, winning two for its makeup and sound mixing."

        "content": "On June 13, at a top-secret government laboratory in rural California, a weaponized version of influenza, called Project Blue, is accidentally released. A U.S. Army soldier, Charlie Campion, escapes the lab and flees across the country with his wife and daughter, unintentionally spreading the virus. On June 17, Campion crashes his car into a gas station in Arnette, Texas, where Stu Redman and some friends are gathered. With his wife and child already dead from the superflu, Campion warns Redman that he had been pursued by a \"Dark Man\" since they left the lab, before he succumbs to the virus as well. The next day, the U.S. military arrives to quarantine the town on orders from General Starkey, commander of Project Blue. The townspeople are taken to a CDC facility in Stovington, Vermont. All but Stu succumb to the superflu, called \"Captain Trips\" by the populace, which kills 99.4% of the world's population in two weeks. General Starkey commits suicide, and it is implied that the rest of his team are killed by the superflu. The scattered survivors include would-be rock star Larry Underwood, deaf mute Nick Andros, Frannie Goldsmith and her unborn child, her teenaged neighbor Harold Lauder, imprisoned criminal Lloyd Henreid, and \"Trashcan Man\", a mentally ill arsonist and scavenger. The survivors begin having visions, either from kindly Mother Abagail, or from the demonic \"Dark Man\" Randall Flagg. The dreams counsel the survivors to either travel to Nebraska to meet Abagail, or to Las Vegas to join Flagg. Lloyd is freed from prison by Flagg in exchange for becoming his second in command. Trashcan Man destroys fuel tanks across the Midwest and is directed to Las Vegas. Larry escapes New York City with a mysterious woman named Nadine Cross. Despite their mutual attraction, Nadine is unable to consummate a relationship with Larry because of her visions of Flagg, who commands her to join him; she leaves Larry to travel on her own. Larry then meets a young school teacher named Lucy, and a traumatized boy she calls Joe, outside Des Moines, Iowa, which has been burned to the ground, most likely by \"Trashcan Man\", who is seen blowing up a petroleum refinery. After escaping the CDC facility, Stu gathers a group of survivors, including Frannie, Harold, and former college professor Glen Bateman. They are joined by various other immune survivors. Harold is consumed with jealousy over Stu's leadership of the group and his growing relationship with Frannie, on whom Harold has an unrequited crush. Nick barely escapes an attempt on his life in Shoyo, Arkansas by the bigoted town bully, and makes his way across the Mid-South. Nick ends up in May, Oklahoma where he meets Tom Cullen, a large mentally challenged man who spells every meaningful word he utters as M-O-O-N. The two men travel into Kansas, and encounter Julie Lawry, a vicious girl who vows to kill them when they refuse to let her join them. Nick and Tom then meet kindly farmer Ralph Brentner, and the three head west together in Ralph's pickup truck. Nick's group reaches Abagail's farm in Hemingford Home, Nebraska. She warns that a great conflict is imminent and they must travel to Boulder, Colorado. The survivors form a community called the Boulder Free Zone and begin restoring civilization. Flagg sets up a brutal autocratic regime in Las Vegas, with the intent of defeating the Boulder survivors using salvaged nuclear weapons, which he sends \"Trashcan Man\" out to find. Harold's resentment toward Stu and Frannie intensifies, causing him to be seduced by Nadine and join forces with Flagg. Abagail, convinced that she has fallen into the sin of pride, leaves Boulder to walk in the wilderness in an act of atonement. Three Boulder survivors are chosen by the Free Zone Committee to infiltrate Las Vegas as spies: Tom, Dayna Jurgens, and Judge Farris. Glen hypnotizes Tom to follow a specific set of instructions, including that he leave Las Vegas at the next full moon. Harold and Nadine plant a bomb in Frannie and Stu's home using demolition dynamite, planning to set it off during a meeting of the Free Zone Committee. A weakened Abagail returns to town, and gives a psychic warning to the council members. The warning allows most of the council to escape the explosion, but Nick and a few others are killed. Before she passes away, Abagail tells Stu, Larry, Glen, Ralph, and Frannie that the men must travel by foot to Las Vegas to confront Flagg. When Nadine and Harold flee Boulder, Flagg causes Harold to be crippled in a motorcycle accident. Nadine leaves him in a ravine, and he kills himself with a gun the next day. Once Nadine reaches the desert, Flagg calls her to him. She realizes that she has made a terrible mistake and tries to escape, but Flagg forces himself on her, revealing his true demonic form. Nadine is catatonic following the sexual attack by Flagg, and her hair has turned white. Flagg's men intercept Judge Farris, who is accidentally killed by one of his henchmen, Bobby Terry, before he can be tortured. Flagg tears Bobby to pieces for not following instructions. Upon returning to Las Vegas, Flagg has Dayna brought to him. He plans to torture her for information about the identity of the third spy. Flagg could see Judge Farris and Dayna with his powers, but whenever he tried to see the third spy, all he could see was the moon. After a failed attempt to kill Flagg, Dayna kills herself before he can extract any useful information from her. Tom leaves Las Vegas when the moon is full, but Julie Lawry recognizes him; she tries to alert Flagg, but Tom escapes into the desert and hides from Flagg and his men. A crazed Nadine taunts Flagg, and she commits suicide by jumping off the hotel balcony with the baby he conceived in her. With winter approaching, Stu, Larry, Glen, and Ralph leave Boulder to set out on their quest. Stu breaks his leg when he falls in a dry riverbed, and must be left behind with Glen's dog, Kojak. The remaining three are captured by Flagg's forces a few days later, and Glen is separated from Larry and Ralph. Flagg orders Lloyd to kill Glen after he taunts Flagg. As Larry and Ralph endure a show trial on Fremont Street, Flagg uses his powers to silence a dissenter, striking him with a ball of plasma energy emitted from his fingers. \"Trashcan Man\" arrives towing a stolen nuclear weapon with an ATV and showing signs of radiation poisoning, so Flagg orders Lloyd to kill him. Flagg is unable to stop the energy ball from transforming into a spectral hand, the Hand of God, and it detonates the nuclear bomb as the voice of Mother Abagail declares that God's promise has been kept, and she welcomes Larry and Ralph into heaven. Las Vegas is destroyed by the nuclear blast, and Flagg is apparently killed along with all of his followers. Stu is rescued by Tom, and they witness the nuclear explosion together. Tom takes Stu to a nearby cabin to set his leg as winter arrives, but Stu has contracted the flu. In a dream, Nick comes to Tom and tells him which medicine to give him. Stu recovers from the infection, and the two of them return to Boulder in a snow storm via a Snowcat. Stu finds that Frannie has given birth to a daughter, whom she has named Abagail. The baby has contracted the superflu, but she is able to fight off the virus. Lucy reveals that she is pregnant with Larry's child, and Joe sees a spectral image of Mother Abagail, as she blesses the newborn baby. Assured that the immune survivors can safely reproduce, the inhabitants of Boulder set to work rebuilding the world."

        "title": "The Stand (1994 miniseries)_As a theatrical film",
        "content": "King and George A. Romero's first conversations with each other were about the development of an adaptation of 'Salem's Lot (1975) in the late 1970s; although Romero wouldn't be involved in any adaptation of that novel, he did express interest in adapting The Stand during these discussions. While King initially didn't think of the novel being worthy of a film version, Romero's reason was the amount of traveling he could do, as the novel takes place in several locations; and the story's relevance to social issues. Due to the epic style of the novel demanding a huge budget, King and Romero's primary concern was possibly having to deal with financing from major studios, which would likely have meant losing a lot of artistic control or worsening studio reputation if the film was a box office bomb. King recalled in a 1980 interview of Hollywood middlemen being skeptical of Romero's idea of The Stand becoming a feature-length picture for the content's huge scale. There were some studios that did offer King and Romero several option contracts for adapting The Stand shortly after the novel's release, but the two turned all of them down. At the same time, Laurel Entertainment's Richard P. Rubinstein was also obsessed with trying to produce a film of The Stand since the book had been published in 1978, and it became Laurel's pet project throughout the adaptation's development as a theatrical production. In a summer 1979 talk between Romero and Rubinstein, they came up with an idea of how to fund it independently: by producing Creepshow, a low-budget original film that would create a huge profit and increase Laurel's credibility. Both Creepshow and The Stand were first announced in a summer 1980 edition of Cinefantastique, and King completed the first draft in early 1981. Warner Bros. initially wanted King to do a single, two-hour script, but he ended up turning in a screenplay that was over 400 pages (equivalent to six hours in length). Creepshow was released in 1982 to commercial success, and The Stand project garnered the interest of Warner Bros., a company that placed it into development. The budget for The Stand was set around $15\u201325 million just after Creepshow's release. As of September 1982, King had completed two drafts of The Stand. The second draft planned for it to be a two-film series with each movie being two hours. However, Laurel, by the completion of King's third draft in December 1983, switched the plan to one three-hour film. Dario Argento stated in a 1983 interview that he was once approached to direct a film version of The Stand but rejected the offer due to a lack of interest in working on adaptations. King completed the final draft circa 1986. Despite Romero's initial excitement, he grew increasingly distant from the project due to the poor box office performance of King films in the 1980s and conflicts between him and Rubinstein leading him to leave Laurel. Hollywood significantly increased their interest in screen adaptations of King's work after the box office success of Pet Sematary (1989), and many were being pitched in studios following the film's release; one of these was an adaptation of The Stand, which was reported in a January 1990 Cinefantastique article to be \"the most anticipated\" developing King project. Stephen King's most popular novel among fans, The Stand was controversial as a film adaptation from the beginning. Nevertheless, King began working on a screenplay based on the book for Rubinstein. King wrote a 700-page screenplay and then made five attempts to condense it into a 130-page script. Rubinstein disliked King's drafts, suggesting the author knew the novel too closely. Thus, he hired Rospo Pallenberg for screenwriting duties and planned for John Boorman to direct. Rubinstein and Laurel were very serious about the project to the point where they paid Pallenberg $30,000 for just one treatment. However, nothing further materialized. As King put it simply, there was \"too much story for a movie,\" and yet he was skeptical about making a TV version of the book because \"you can't have the end of the world brought to you by Charmin toilet tissue.\""

He has also taken up a job as a pool cleaner, to raise money to buy a camshaft, a part needed to build an engine for a scholarship project that will ensure him a full ride to the school of his choice. Alvin has always dreamed of hanging out with the popular kids, especially Paris Morgan (Christina Milian), a beautiful, popular cheerleader dating NBA star Dru Hilton (Elimu Nelson). When Paris crashes her mother's expensive SUV during an argument with Dru, Alvin agrees to repair the car using the money he had earned for his project, jeopardizing his scholarship opportunity, after a few missteps, Paris eventually pays him back by giving him a $1,500 makeover and agreeing to pretend for two weeks that she's dating Alvin. Alvin then begins to ingratiate himself with the popular crowd. He and Paris grow closer as she shares with him her secret love of music and he shares with her that he knows how to build car engines. Paris begins to develop feelings for Alvin and at the end of their two-week dating period, she tries to hint that she would like to kiss him. However, Alvin misinterprets her and goes along with their original plan of a public break up at school. Even after the break up, Alvin continues to grow in popularity, alienating his former nerdy friends and flirting with Paris's friends. Paris is unhappy to realize how shallow and vapid her friends are, and by extension, Alvin. Tired of him constantly ditching them in favor of the popular kids, Alvin's friends confront him on the matter, during which Alvin's sister Aretha overhears. She comes to realize that Alvin paid Paris to date her seeing how he has nothing of value after his big makeover. She tells their parents, who attempt to talk to Alvin, but he blows them off. At the end of the year on Senior Ditch Day, Paris asks Alvin to hang out as real friends, but a newly egotistical Alvin insults her. They argue and storm off from each other. Dru is also at the party to meet up with Paris but breaks up with her when he finds out she had been \"dating\" Alvin. In an attempt to win Dru back, Paris reveals the truth about her and Alvin to the whole school, and Alvin is immediately ostracized. Now back to being unpopular, Alvin finally realizes he does not have the camshaft for his project. Alvin's father Clarence (Steve Harvey) pays for the camshaft, telling Alvin that they will work out a plan later to pay him back while also explaining to Alvin that he'd supported his sudden transformation because he wanted Alvin to have the same experiences he did while he was in high school, seeing as he was one of the most popular guys at his school. He also admits that he didn't have Alvin's brains or potential but he's always been proud of his son. With this confidence restored, Alvin builds an engine with the part his dad bought. Alvin's friends push the broken car they had been working on into the garage. They congratulate him on a job well done on completing the engine but are still angry with him for blowing them off. Alvin sees that their car needs a new engine so he installs the one he just built to restore their car, telling them to let him have it sometime within that next week so he can present it to the scholarship committee. Alvin's friends forgive him. Together, they all attend a school basketball game where Alvin stands up for his nerd friends against the basketball players. Alvin finally redeems himself in front of everyone and his friends become friendly with the popular crowd. Alvin leaves the gymnasium, and as Paris follows him out, she is stopped by Dru. Paris blows him off and chases after Alvin. They finally kiss and agree to start a real relationship."

In an attempt to restore Cordelia's memory, Lorne obtains a bottle containing a memory-restoration spell, which Cordelia is eager to try. Wesley arrives, having been asked to help with the spell, and has an awkward meeting with Fred. She vaguely informs him that her mission was completed, as Gunn realizes that Wesley helped Fred try to kill her professor. When he confronts Wesley, he also threatens Wes to not pursue Fred, but Wes tries to dismiss the issue. Gunn asks what happened to Wesley. He reminds Gunn that \"I had my throat cut and all my friends abandoned me.\" The gang hold hands in a circle around the bottle as it starts to spin. The spell disorients everyone; Lorne passes out and the others stumble about the lobby as if very high. Cordelia accidentally smashes the bottle with her boot. All present are mentally regressed to the age of 17: Cordelia when she was the most popular girl at Sunnydale High, Wesley believes he is still a student at the Watcher's Academy, Gunn is once again a rebellious street kid, Fred is transformed into a younger and insecure girl who likes marijuana; and Angel has reverted to his teenaged pre-vampire self \u2014 an Irishman named Liam (he was not sired until age 26). While Liam wonders what happened to his Irish accent, Gunn and Wesley butt heads on plans. When Wesley tries to demonstrate his toughness with a karate demonstration, he unintentionally activates the stake weapon up his sleeve. Gunn and Fred find Lorne passed out behind the counter, and are shocked to see a demon. Meanwhile, Connor saves a young woman from two vampires. The woman offers her body in repayment, but only if he pays. Back at the hotel, Wesley duct tapes Lorne to the seat in the lobby while arguing with Gunn over whether to cut Lorne's head off or torture him for information. When Cordelia asks why they're not freaking out about wooden stakes or the sight of a green man with horns, Wesley and Gunn both reveal that vampires and demons are real and they both have experience with them. Fred examines an unconscious Lorne while Wesley shares his theory that they're being kept in the hotel with a vampire as a test. They all start to wonder why they don't look 17, and collectively decide to hunt for the vampire that will supposedly set them free once they kill it. Cordelia and Angel team up and go one way while the other three head in the other direction. Angel struggles to adjust to this strange world that is hundreds of years beyond his life. He and Cordelia sit on the bed, and after apologizing for acting so \"womanish\", Cordelia comforts him, and, feeling his muscles, begins to flirt with him.  Angel vamps out and realizes he is a vampire and he will be killed if the gang finds out. Angel tries to leave the hotel, but panics when he spots the cars on the street and rushes back inside. As the group regathers in the lobby, Wesley introduces a new theory: the vampire may be one of them. He passes a cross around the group, but when it finally reaches Angel, he manages to hide his smoking hand until a distraction develops. Lorne wakes up, his memory unaffected, and identifies Angel as a vampire. Angel punches Lorne, knocking him out again. A fight breaks out between Angel, Wesley and Gunn, and the girls run in separate directions. Angel catches Cordelia, who screams loudly, drawing a lurking Connor out of the shadows. Angel rants to Connor about fathers as the two fight, while in the lobby, Lorne convinces Fred to release him, and he mixes together a concoction to restore their memories. After treating the others, Lorne puts a touch of the mixture on Cordy's tongue. She pauses and then runs off. Lorne finishes up his story at the lounge: describing what really happened was she was struck with a vision of a terrifying demon; Cordelia reveals to Angel that she remembers everything, and confirms that before she lost her memory she was in love with him. Lorne then walks off and the camera reveals an empty Lounge."

        "content": "Writer/director Joss Whedon says this episode grew out of his desire to see Wesley returned to the \"bumbling moron\" of the past. \"We were reminiscing about the days when he was a complete idiot, and so we thought we wanted to see old-school Wesley but also cool, new-school Wesley,\" Whedon explains.  Although the regression to a comedic figure contrasts his new, darker persona, Wesley still exhibits heroism during this episode, which is in line with the growth his character experienced over the last four years. Peggy Davis argues that \"Wesley can embody masculine heroism or feminine comic figure, but not both\"; however in this episode he demonstrates that his heroic masculinity allows for a comedic element as well.  In addition to bringing back \"classic Wesley\", this episode also gave the opportunity to refresh viewers' memories of \"teenage bitch queen\" Cordelia from Buffy, whose character changed dramatically during her time on Angel. Whedon gave Lorne's spell the side-effect of making the gang \"high\" to differentiate this memory spell from a similar one used in the Buffy episode \"Tabula Rasa\", readily admitting the spell itself is \"lazy writing,\" meant only to set the plot in motion.  The frame narrative established by Lorne in the night club was done to highlight the postmodern aspects of the episode, explains Whedon. The artificiality of the night club, and Lorne's breaking of the fourth wall when he comments on the commercials that played during the act break, provides a foreground for the alternate reality caused by the spell. Whedon notes that while writing this episode, he already knew that Connor and Cordelia were going to have sex, but the story had to move faster than he had originally planned because Carpenter became pregnant."

The film stars Walter Slezak as the titular Michael, the young assistant and model to the artist Claude Zoret (Benjamin Christensen). Along with Different From the Others (1919) and Sex in Chains (1928), Michael is widely considered a landmark in gay silent cinema. The film is based on Herman Bang's 1902 novel Mika\u00ebl. It is the second screen adaptation of the book, the first being The Wings, made eight years prior by director Mauritz Stiller. Michael, however, follows Bang's storyline much more closely than the earlier film version did."

Self-conscious of being considerably older than Michael, Zoret acts jealous and possessive. Michael begins to drift from him, causing Zoret to passive aggressively drive Michael away further. When a bankrupt countess comes to Zoret to have a portrait made \u2014 with the real intent of seducing him and swindling his money \u2014 she finds Michael to be more receptive to her advances. At her lead, the two quickly become a couple and she immediately begins using Michael to steal from Zoret. When Zoret discovers what has been going on, he is crushed and his work suffers terribly. Michael sells the painting of himself that Zoret made and gave to him as a gift, and steals and sells the sketches Zoret made of their time in Algiers, where they first fell in love. Zoret begins work on his masterpiece: a large-scale painting of a man lying on a beach, using Algiers as a background, depicting \"a man who has lost everything\", as one character put it on first sight of the work. After completing the painting, Zoret falls ill. Charles Switt sits beside Zoret on his deathbed. Switt had always loved Zoret, and has stayed with him throughout, never criticizing Michael for fear of hurting his unrequited love. Switt sends a message to Michael, telling him that Zoret is dying and to come at once, but the Countess prevents him from getting it. Zoret's last words, which also serve as the prologue to the film, are \"Now I can die in peace, for I have seen true love.\""

Two psychopathic killers, Dancer and Julian, and their driver McLain then collect the contraband, and they murder several people along the way.  Lt. Ben Guthrie leads the police hunt for the criminals. The head of the heroin ring is a person known only as \"The Man\". The story begins when an American tourist disembarking in San Francisco from a cruise ship returning from Hong Kong has his bag stolen by a cabbie.  As the cabbie takes off at high speed, he strikes and kills a police officer.  The cab later crashes and the cabbie is killed.  A police investigation discloses that the cab driver is a heroin addict, and attention is drawn to a heroin smuggling ring. Dancer and Julian have instructions to retrieve the heroin from the unsuspecting tourists and deliver it to a drop point at Sutro's Museum (a real San Francisco location until it burned down in 1966) where the bag containing the heroin is to be left inside an antique ship's binnacle.  Dancer and Julian are instructed by their contact, Staples, that they must make the drop and be gone before 4:05 pm.  But when it turns out that two of the tourists\u2014Dorothy Bradshaw and her young daughter, Cynthia\u2014had unknowingly disposed of the heroin, Dancer and Julian are in a bind; if they drop off the bag with a large portion of the heroin missing, their lives may be in danger.  Dancer and Julian decide that instead of leaving the bag and departing the premises by 4:05, Dancer will stay, meet The Man and explain why the shipment is short.  Dancer and Julian also kidnap Dorothy and Cynthia and bring them to Sutro's so they can back up the story. They surprise The Man, who turns out to be a cripple in a wheelchair. But when Dancer meets The Man and explains himself, The Man has an unexpected reaction; he tells Dancer that \"nobody ever sees me,\" and that because Dancer has seen him, \"you're dead\". The Man slaps Dancer across the face with the bag of heroin and Dancer, enraged, pushes The Man off a balcony, killing him. Meanwhile, the San Francisco police have spotted the getaway car with Julian, McLain, and the kidnapped Dorothy and Cynthia.  When Dancer exits Sutro's, a high speed car chase ensues, filmed in the area of The Embarcadero.  When the car becomes trapped at a barrier on the Embarcadero Freeway, there is a shootout between Dancer and the police."

Desperately short of cash and overdue on paying his rent, Crain goes to the apartment of Professor Stanley (Francis Pierlot), a teacher who has a sideline as a pawnbroker, though Crain is already in debt to him too.  Crain pawns his father's watch for a small amount of money, but notes details in the professor's apartment, including the strong box and wall safe where he keeps his money and a heavy fireplace poker. A bit later at a diner, Crain meets a young woman (Anne Gynne) who doesn't have cash to pay for her coffee.  Crain covers her bill, and she promises to pay him back.  However, when Crain receives a tuition bill from the school and an ultimatum from his landlady, he returns to the professor's apartment.  Managing to be admitted by the professor without anyone else seeing him, including a painter at work in a room, Crain presents a tightly-wrapped object that he claims to be a cigarette case he'd like to pawn.  While the professor struggles to unwrap the package and comes to realize that it is only a glass ashtray, Crain grabs a poker with his gloved hands and strikes the professor dead. Crain nervously tries to open the strongbox, but before he can grab the money, he hears a couple of his school friends at the door, one of whom has an appointment with the professor.  When their door knocks are not answered, the two worry that something is wrong and go off to find the janitor.  Crain steps out without the money and closes the door, which locks behind him.  Hearing his friends and the janitor approaching, he hides in the room that was being painted and finally escapes the building, but with a paint stain on his coat and no money. A police detective (Nestor Paiva) brings Crain to the police station, where he is questioned by Captain Burke (Warren William) because his watch had been found at the professor's apartment among other pawned items.  As Crain leaves the office, the house painter is brought in but states that he's never seen Crain before.  Crain burns his stained jacket, but then his luck takes some sudden turns.  He receives a check for a thousand dollars from a journal for an article that he wrote, and he meets the young woman again, now working at the diner where they met.  Learning that her name is Eileen and with cash in his pocket, Crain begins to go out with her. Crain, however, is still a police suspect, even though the painter has been taken into custody.  The detective seems to be following him everywhere, and he meets with Captain Burke again.  Burke is interested in Crain's journal article, where he argued that some lives are less valuable than others and that traditional morality should not apply in such cases.  Eileen is also disturbed when discussing Crain's ideas with him.  The pressure from the police and Crain's own conscience disorient and haunt him despite his stated philosophy, and he is nearly run down while wandering in a daze on a railroad track.  He even confesses to Eileen, but she promises to go elsewhere with him if he does not turn himself in. Crain goes to Burke's office, but Burke reveals that the painter has confessed to the killing. Even though he doubts the painter's claim, Burke has no other evidence to continue considering Crain a suspect.  Relieved, Crain sees Eileen on a busy street corner and runs to meet her only to be struck by a car. In a final twist, however, Crain is seen lying on his apartment bed, wearing the jacket we had seen him burn, now unstained.  He sees his glass ashtray by the bed and hears a knock at the door.  Professor Stanley, quite alive, enters, stating he took pity on Crain's situation and handing him one hundred fifty dollars as a loan. The \"murder\" and its aftermath had all been a dream.  Crain's landlady then enters with a telegram that his scholarship has been renewed after all.  In the hallway, Crain encounters a new tenant, Eileen, who returns the money he had paid for her coffee--the previous night.  The young woman is puzzled that Crain calls her \"Eileen\" when her name is really Cathy, but takes it as a sign of romantic fate, agreeing to see him and even to let him call her \"Eileen.\""

When their first child is born, they agree that she will be a full-time mom and he will work hard to get a promotion. When Tom gets fired after defending his friend Paco, he takes a job in Ohio working at the ad agency where his father-in-law is the assistant director. Tom is assigned to report to Chip. Chip is a strict and hard-working paraplegic man who is coincidentally Sofia's ex-boyfriend from high school. Chip still carries an obsession with her, so he conspires to make Tom's work life miserable. As Tom's frustrations mount, Chip begins to sway Sofia to his side. Tom begins to suspect that Chip isn't handicapped at all and goes through his desk. He finds a photo of Chip playing tennis and rushes to his in-laws' house to see his wife and show her the picture. He finds Chip having dinner with Sofia and her parents and holding Tom's child. Tom mercilessly tries to prove that Chip isn't actually paralyzed by dragging him up a flight of stairs and then throws him, expecting him to stand up to prevent falling. Chip doesn't stand up (the photo actually being Chip's late twin brother) and Tom is humiliated in front of his family. Later, he confronts Chip outside his house and attacks him, where Chip reveals that he really can walk, but can't fight outside of his chair. After sitting back down, Chip beats him severely and reveals that he plans to sleep with Sofia, much to Tom's already-increased rage. It's revealed that Paco had called Chip under the guise of being an ad agency boss in Barcelona, telling Chip that he got a job and convincing him to fly to Spain. Excited by the news, Chip goes to Sofia and asks her to come with him. However, Tom accosts them both and convinces her not to go with Chip. Chip, angry that Sofia chose Tom over him, heartlessly mocks Tom and reveals he \"faked his orgasm\" to Sofia before getting out of his chair and walking out. While chastising them from outside, Chip is hit by a bus and ends up paralyzed from the waist down, crippling him for real.

        "content": "On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 18% approval rating based on 99 reviews with an average rating of 4.34/10. The site's consensus states: \"The Ex suffers from inept direction and characters that are either unsympathetic or plain unpleasant to watch.\" By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 32, based on 24 reviews. Several film critics said the film felt truncated. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said the film \"seems arbitrarily edited to squeeze in extra screenings before it's killed by word-of-mouth.\" Film critics also felt that the majority of the cast's talents were wasted. Many film critics also compared the film to a sitcom. Pam Grady of Reel.com said the film \"never rises above the level of a TV show grotesquely inflated for the big screen.\" Jesse Peretz was criticized for his direction by many critics. Phoebe Flowers of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel said the film was \"directed with a breathtaking lack of instinct by Jesse Peretz.\" A few critics described the film as half-baked. Sean Means of The Salt Lake Tribune said \"It's like undercooked lasagna: lots of layers, but the flavors never blend.\" Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic said the film was Zach Braff's most average movie so far. Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer said that after The Last Kiss and Garden State, \"Braff's shtick...is getting tired.\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post said the film \"marks an all-time low for actor Zach Braff -- his Gigli, if you will..\" The screenwriters, David Guion and Michael Handelman, virtually disowned the finished film. Handelman said, \"I think what we wrote was meant to be a bit less broad than the film that came out. I think a lot of what you see in either of those films is stuff that was not written by us even though we\u2019re the only credited writers on that.\" Guion added, \"That movie was a bit of a cautionary story for screenwriters in terms of that it was a movie that struggled a little bit and didn\u2019t test well initially, and the financers panicked and said, 'We better show a lot of people getting hit in the balls'...  It was unfortunate because the director, Jesse Peretz, is great and very talented, but the movie was ultimately taken out of his hands.\" Zach Braff and Jason Bateman were praised for their performances by several critics. Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel said \"Braff and Bateman make this patchwork just funny enough to be worth our trouble.\" Jason Bateman was praised by several film critics as being the best part of the movie. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews said \"there's little doubt that Bateman deserves the lion's share of praise thanks to his scene-stealing work as Tom's hilariously smug nemesis.\""

        "content": "In 1899, Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is an inventor teaching at Columbia University in New York City. Unlike his friend David Philby, Alexander would rather do pure research than work in the world of business. After a mugger kills his fianc\u00e9e Emma, he devotes himself to building a time machine that will allow him to travel back in time to save her. When he completes the machine four years later, he travels back to 1899 and prevents her murder, only to see her killed again when a horseless carriage frightens the horses of a horse-drawn vehicle. Alexander realizes that any attempt to save Emma will result in her death through other circumstances. He travels to 2030 to discover whether science has been able to solve his question of how to change the past. At the New York Public Library, a holographic librarian called Vox 114 insists time travel to the past is impossible. Alexander travels to 2037, when the accidental destruction of the Moon by lunar colonists has begun rendering the Earth virtually uninhabitable. While restarting the time machine to avoid debris, he is knocked unconscious and travels to the year 802,701 before reawakening. The human race has reverted to a primitive lifestyle and the Earth has healed. Some survivors, called \"Eloi\", live on the sides of cliffs of what was once Manhattan. Alexander is nursed back to health by a virtuous young woman named Mara, one of the few Eloi who speak English. He observes the broken moon and realises that maybe his teachings led to this future. One night, Alexander and Mara's younger brother, Kalen, dream of a frightening, jagged-toothed face and a creature calling their name. Alexander informs Mara of the dream and she tells him they all have that dream, and she notices that his watch is missing. The next day, the Eloi are attacked and Mara is dragged underground by ape-themed monsters. The creatures are called \"Morlocks\" and they hunt the Eloi for food. In order to rescue Mara, Kalen leads Alexander to Vox 114, which is still functional after 800,000 years. After learning from Vox how to find the Morlocks, Alexander enters their underground lair through an opening that resembles the face in his nightmare. He is captured and thrown into an area where Mara sits in a cage. Alexander meets an intelligent, humanoid Morlock, who explains that Morlocks are the evolutionary descendants of the humans who went underground after the Moon broke apart, while the Eloi are evolved from those who remained on the surface. The humanoid Morlocks are a caste of telepaths who rule the other Morlocks. The Morlock explains that Alexander cannot alter Emma's fate, because her death is what drove him to build the time machine in the first place: saving her would be a virtual impossibility due to temporal paradox. He then reveals that the Morlocks have brought the time machine underground, and tells Alexander to get into it and return home. Alexander gets into the machine but pulls the Morlock in with him, carrying them into the future as they fight. The Morlock dies by rapidly aging when Alexander pushes him outside of the machine's temporal bubble. Alexander stops in the year 635,427,810, revealing a harsh, rust-colored sky over a wasteland of Morlock caves. Accepting that he cannot save Emma, Alexander travels back to rescue Mara. After freeing her, he starts the time machine and jams its gears, creating a violent distortion in time. Pursued by the Morlocks, Alexander and Mara escape to the surface as the time distortion explodes, killing the Morlocks and destroying their caves along with the time machine. Alexander begins a new life with Mara and the Eloi. In 1903, Philby and Mrs. Watchit, Alexander's housekeeper, are in his laboratory discussing his absence. Philby tells Mrs. Watchit he is glad that Alexander has gone to a place where he can find peace, then tells her that he would like to hire her as a housekeeper, which she accepts until Alexander returns. Mrs. Watchit bids Alexander farewell and Philby leaves, looking toward the laboratory affectionately, then throws his bowler hat away in tribute to Alexander's objection to conformity."

According to Hichcock's theory, shots of lethal poison followed shortly after by an antidote could cure his physical disability. The younger Doctor Livingstone (Peter Baldwin) stays with him in the house to regularly administer this dangerous treatment. Hichcock's wife Margaret (Barbara Steele) finds living with her husband increasingly unbearable. Possibly suspected by her husband, she is having an affair with Livingstone. She implores him to murder Hichcock, which he eventually does by injecting the poison but not administering the antidote. During the distribution of Hichcock's estate, Margaret and Livingstone learn Hichcock only recently changed his last will and testament. Margaret gets the house and its contents, but only a third share of her husband's bonds, shares, currency and jewels, which are kept in the doctor's safe. Upon Catherine telling them that the key to the safe containing the valuables was in the jacket buried with him, they secretly visit his vault, open his coffin and retrieve it, intending to take a larger share of the valuables. Livingstone opens the safe while Margaret is out of the room with Catherine. It is empty. Later, they hear Hichcock's voice calling to them and experience other poltergeist phenomena, including the appearance of the ghost-like Hichcock himself. One night, Catherine, apparently possessed by Hichcock, speaks in his voice and tells Margaret that his valuables are buried beneath his coffin. She returns to the vault to find a golden box. Upon opening it, she cuts herself. The box contains nothing but a skull. Catherine then insinuates that Livingstone took the valuables for himself when he opened the safe in Margaret's absence. Margaret finds jewels in his bag, much to Livingstone's surprise. Margaret slashes him to death with a razor and drags him into the cellar where she uses kerosene from a lamp to burn his body. Margaret is drawn to Hichcock's study by the ringing of his handbell, where she contemplates suicide by poison, pours it into a glass of gin, but does not drink it. She starts feeling ill and sits down when Hichcock appears, alive and no longer disabled. He tells her that he poisoned the box with a non-lethal dose of curare, which is now quickly paralyzing her. Hichcock shoots his accomplice Catherine dead and makes Margaret touch the gun to incriminate her. Finally, he toasts Margaret's ill health with the glass of gin she poured for herself, and drinks it. When he realizes it is poisoned, he begs Margaret for the antidote. She laughs and destroys the vial of antidote. Hichcock seals himself inside a secret room behind the bookshelf, locking himself in. The police arrive and arrest the laughing and paralyzed Margaret for Catherine's murder, carrying her out of the room. When Canon Owens, the parish priest, arrives and hears muffled noises from behind the library bookshelf, he addresses Hichcock's portrait with the words, \"I told you, Doctor Hichcock, the devil is a very real person.\" He then leaves the room."

Another yawns, and is also dropped through a trapdoor under his desk and replaced by a robot. Three more are eliminating for drinking water, sneezing and injury (one of them desperately plugs his nose with two pencils, but is unable to keep from sneezing, propelling the pencils into another's head). They are replaced by more robots. The remaining worker, madly scribbling away, is shocked to discover that his boss has been replaced by a boss robot. When the latter leaves, the last worker decides to take action, and begins destroying the robots in various cartoony ways (blowing one up with a stick of dynamite, dropping another through its desk trapdoor, yet another by hitting it with different objects, and electrically shocking another into a pile of cinders). As the worker and the one remaining robot are locked in a life-or-death struggle, they see the boss robot threatening to push the trapdoor button. In a sudden instance of cooperating, they shove the trapdoor beneath the boss robot, who falls in. As the two workers peer down the open trapdoor, the remaining worker becomes aware of the opportunity being presented and shoves the robot in thus ending the film with a cigar in his hand and eventually pushing the trapdoor button on the viewer."

All goes as planned until Connie's sister, Kate (Annette Bening), her investment broker husband, Roman Craig (Dan Aykroyd), and their mostly-silent twin daughters, Mara and Cara, unexpectedly arrive uninvited. Ghost stories after the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met directly when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear (Bart the Bear). When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from then on, it was known as the \"Bald-Headed Bear\" of Clare County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat a 96-ounce steak called \"the Old 96'er\" at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's feelings of loneliness with Roman despite their wealth. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, Roman tells of the time at his and Kate's wedding when he overheard a conversation between Chet and their father-in-law describing how they think Roman is a crooked businessman. Roman then tells Chet why he came up to visit: to offer Chet a $25,000 investment opportunity. Chet, feeling guilty from the wedding story, is initially reluctant, but eventually agrees to write Roman a check for the whole amount. The families say their goodbyes and Roman and his family head back to Chicago. On the car ride home, Kate praises Roman for including Chet in the investment, noting that $25,000 is a lot of money for them. Roman, now feeling guilty himself, halts the car and returns to the cabin. Upon his return, Roman confesses that the story about the wedding conversation never happened and that he is broke from some failed investments. His true intention for coming up to the lake was to solicit money from Chet to financially recover. During a thunderstorm, Kate discovers the twins have gone missing. Chet and Roman find them at the bottom of an old mine shaft, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny space. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman reluctantly climbs down into the mine, while Chet searches for a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and escapes the shaft on his own. Upon returning with the rope, Chet is horrified to discover the \"Bald-Headed Bear\" lurking in the mine. It chases him back to the cabin, smashes through the door, and rampages through the house. Wally, the cabin owner, bursts in with a loaded shotgun while Roman tries to hold off the animal with a fireplace poker and an oar. Chet takes the gun and shoots the bear, blowing the fur off its rear. Roaring in pain, the bear runs out of the house. The next morning, the families part on amicable terms. Unbeknownst to Chet, Connie has invited the Craigs to stay with them until they can recover. Cammie accepts Buck's apologies and they end their brief romance, as the Ripleys return to Chicago. During the credits, Chet, Connie, Roman, and Kate are in a bar dancing to \"Land of a Thousand Dances\". In a post-credits scene, two raccoons (who rummaged through the trash cans throughout the film) talk in their language about \"Jody\" sitting in the lake and that she is now is \"bald on both ends\"."

Gunnar Fischer, who had been director of photography on many of Ingmar Bergman's films, handled the cinematography for Parade. Filming took place at the Stockholm Cirkus in 1973 and employed a mixture of video, 16mm and 35mm stock. The film begins with a crowd of colorfully-dressed people filing into a theater that is being set up for a clown-themed performance. Tati, in the role of Monsieur Loyal, informs the audience that they are invited to be part of the show, which he calls \"the parade\". He serves essentially as emcee for a variety show that includes sight gags, mime, juggling, slapstick skits, dancing, animal acts, musical jokes, and magic tricks. At times, audience members participate in the festivities. The film was screened at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition.

Carden's plan goes awry when he gets injured in a car accident and ends up in the hospital. When hospital staff see his gun, they call the police. They are able to peel away his false identity and federal marshals are called in to pick him up. Widower Ray Keene (John Cusack), a high school gym teacher, ex-cop and well-intentioned but not very able dad to Chris (Jamie Anderson), belatedly realizes the need to bond with his son when the latter gets caught smoking marijuana and takes him hiking in the wilderness. Carden is being driven through that same wilderness by the marshals but his men stage a rescue attempt. The car is crashed and most of the marshals end up dead. The surviving marshal asks Keene to take the prisoner to the authorities and then dies of his injuries. Ray and Chris have to get Carden out of the wilderness and hand him over to the authorities. Carden's men, highly skilled ex-military thugs, track them down to rescue Carden and kill the Keenes.  The pursuit brings a couple, Sandra and Lochlan (Megan Dodds and Ryan McCluskey) into the crossfire, with Lochlan being killed by Carden's men. I In a tense standoff in a cabin in the woods, Carden's friends turn up and Keene agrees to let Carden go. Just at that moment, one of Carden's thugs bursts in and punches Chris, causing Keene to panic and kill him, while Sandra shoots the other as he enters firing. Carden escapes, taking Chris as a hostage, while Sandra and Keene are rescued by the local police. Miles (Alice Krige), Carden's mission handler, tells Davis (Corey Johnson), Carden's recent recruit, to kill Carden and Chris and to make it look like Carden did it. She also tells him to kill Keene in case Carden told him anything about his job. Feeling defeated and resting at home, a televised news report echoes an earlier conversation about Carden's job description with the key phrase \"exterminating obstacles to progress\" which makes Keene aware of Carden's intended target. Keene heads to the funeral of Hammond, Jr., to intercept Carden and inadvertently saves Carden from Davis. Carden gets the upper hand on Davis, killing him with his own sniper rifle. However, the battle forces Carden to miss his own window of opportunity to assassinate Hammond, Sr. Carden relents in giving Keene a set of keys to a hotel room where Carden locked up Chris, letting father and son reunite while he disappears. In Washington, D.C., Carden intercepts Miles, aware of her role in hiring Davis to kill him. Carden threatens to \"come after her\" if any harm were to come to the Keene family. Two weeks after the incident, Keene enters into a relationship with Sandra and holds a family barbecue, expressing disbelief in hearing a radio news report about Hammond, Sr., dying in a \"boating accident\", realizing that Carden finished his contract killing."

The episode was directed by Paul Feig, his second credit after \"Office Olympics\". This episode is the only episode to date to have a quote to play over the Deedle-Dee Productions title card in the closing credits. The quote features Dwight Schrute exclaiming \"Quiet, you!\" Daniels came up with the idea of an episode centered on an employee getting fired, but wanted to focus on the perspective of a boss having to deal with the dilemma of letting an employee go. Since Daniels could not fire a series regular due to their contracts, he narrowed down the decision to either Creed or Devon, who at the time were both background characters. Daniels did not initially know which character would ultimately be fired but decided on Devon once discovering that the actor, Devon Abner, had an upcoming theatre contract that conflicted with the series' production. During the pre-production for the episode, the cast and crew realized that the Halloween concept would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their \"usual, realistically plain suits\". B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience \"fun\", noting that \"seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, I think, one of the most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels.\" The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which \"Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat\". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume. \"Halloween\" marks the last appearance of Devon in an episode until the series finale, seven seasons later. Although Devon was only a background character, he is mentioned during \"The Dundies\", seen in the background of \"The Fire\", and is seen in a deleted scene during \"Diversity Day\". Devon is later seen in a deleted scene on \"Valentine's Day\", when Michael passes by a homeless Devon in New York. Devon then chases Michael, presumably still angry over the events of \"Halloween\".

The \"Can I trust Jim\u00a0...\" line was a direct reference to the show and was a \"last-second addition\" according to Daniels. In addition, Randall Einhorn, the cameraman for the episode, was a cameraman for Survivor. When the episode was being written, many of the cast and crew feared that it would bear too many stylistic resemblances to Curb Your Enthusiasm. Daniels later defended the show, saying that the show was different because of \"the fact that they are on TV and they know they are being filmed. [They know they're] on camera.\" During the writing of the episode, Daniels made the writers spend actual time on the set, most notably in Michael's office. Mindy Kaling later noted that she \"hated it.\" The first cut of the episode ran 37 minutes long and the producers were tasked with cutting the footage down to 22 minutes. Executive producer Greg Daniels considered making the episode a two-parter, one focusing on the Alliance and another focusing on Meredith's birthday party, but the appearance of party hats in the Alliance-only scenes caused him to nix this idea. Because the episode had to be cut down due to time, several scenes were drastically cut. The filming crew actually shot about 15\u201320 minutes of Steve Carell coming up with terrible card ideas, which was drastically reduced. During the party, Ryan talks to a different woman in the background of each scene. Although not much footage made it into the final episode, the producers thought this was a nice character touch for the new employee. The penultimate scenes of Michael telling several terrible jokes to Meredith were also trimmed down. The final scene where Roy confronts Jim was shot ten different times, each in a different style, ranging from Roy slamming Jim into the wall to Roy asking Jim, \"Hey, what are you doing?\" Although the crew felt that the wall-slamming version was more dramatic, they realized that it caused the episode to go from a comedy to an \"angry drama.\" Several of the lines and scenes from the episode were improvised or ad-libbed by the cast. Jenna Fischer named the party planning scene her favorite scene and called it \"longest most horrible meeting of all time\". On the commentary track for the episode, Fischer revealed that the scene was almost entirely ad-libbed. At one point, Phyllis Smith, who portrays Phyllis Margaret Vance (n\u00e9e Lapin), made a joke that made every one on set laugh, forcing production to halt for almost 45 minutes. Dwight's \"gun show\" joke was written by Rainn Wilson. Larry Wilmore later called the \"gun show\" scene his favorite. Wilmore later said of ab-libs, \"part of the fun in writing a show like this is trying to write lines that sound like ad-libs.\" Daniels also praised the episode's lines, saying, \"when you know the acting is really good, it all sounds like it's been improvised.\" The scenes where Dwight climbs into a box almost did not make the episode. Mike Schur, who wrote the episode, feared that Dwight climbing into the box would not only make the episode \"crazy broad,\" but also make the rest of the episode look boring by comparison. After shooting the scene, however, he described it as \"the most natural thing in the world.\" Phil Shaw, the stunt man for The Office, did most of the work in the box. Schur described Dwight's emergence from the box as his \"action hero\" moment. Daniels likened the scene to the movie Alien."

The plot tells the story of inventor Wayne Szalinski as he accidentally shrinks himself, his wife, brother, and sister-in-law with his electromagnetic shrink ray. Rick Moranis returns as Wayne Szalinski, and is the only cast member from the previous films to reprise their role. Eve Gordon replaces Marcia Strassman as Diane Szalinski, and their youngest son Adam, now a pre-teen, is played by Bug Hall. Wayne and Diane's two older children, Amy and Nick, do not appear but are mentioned as having gone away to college and living adult lives. The cast includes Wayne's extended family, including his brother, Gordon, sister-in-law Patti, and niece and nephew Jenny and Mitch. The film is also the first Walt Disney Pictures live-action direct-to-video release, and stands as Moranis' most recent live-action film role, though he would continue to do voice-acting for the next several years.

However, his interest in sports seems almost alien to Wayne, although Diane is more understanding. Wayne has started his own lab, Szalinski Labs, with his brother, Gordon. One day, they receive tickets to witness a shuttle landing, but Diane reminds him over the phone that he needs to watch Adam and his cousins, Jenny and Mitch, while she and Patti go on vacation. She also reminds him to get rid of a Tiki Man sculpture they keep in the house that she sees as an eyesore, though he considers it a good luck charm. After Diane and Patti leave, Wayne and Gordon have activities planned that bore the kids. Wayne sends them to the store, but reveals to Gordon that it is a ruse to get rid of them long enough so that he can use his shrinking machine in order to shrink the Tiki Man without Diane's knowledge, and spare any accidents with the kids.  However, after carelessly not turning it off immediately after they succeed, Wayne and Gordon are shrunk when a billiard ball left on it falls onto the activating button, just as they are in front of it searching for the Tiki Man. Meanwhile, Patti realizes she forgot to leave Mitch's medicine for his potassium deficiency, and they head back. Hoping to catch Wayne and Gordon by surprise, they sneak up to the attic only to be shrunk when another billiard ball falls onto the activating button. Shortly after, the kids return home, and after hearing Wayne's previous message about the launch, assume they are alone for the evening.  Jenny makes plans to have her friends come over. Upstairs, the adults make use of a fishing rod to lower themselves down into Adam's room. To attempt to get to the floor, they use his Hot Wheels race track, but they overshoot their target and fall down the laundry chute ending up in a clean load that is delivered back upstairs by Adam and Mitch. They tumble out of the laundry basket when it is overturned, and discover Adam and Mitch reading a Sports Illustrated Kids magazine, revealing to Wayne that Adam's interest is not in science as he hoped. The four suddenly encounter a cockroach, but manage to defeat it by luring it into a bug trap. Seeing Mitch struggling, Patti realizes that they need to get him his medicine soon, or he could pass out. He ignores his weaknesses, though, and goes downstairs. The adults witness the arrival of Jenny's friends and decide to use a bubble machine in order to get downstairs. Diane and Patti land safely, but Wayne and Gordon fall into a bowl of onion dip and are nearly devoured by the girls. In the kitchen, when Patti and Diane resolve to find a way up the counter in order to find Mitch's medicine and push it into view, they encounter a daddy long-legs with its leg caught in a spider web, and Diane quietly talks to it as Patti tries to cut the web with a nail file. Diane realizes her own insecurities about being small as she relates to it, which she had earlier tried to kill, and realizes how hard it is to be that size. After it's freed, Patti and Diane realize they can cling to its silk as it climbs up onto the counter. Meanwhile, Wayne and Gordon decide to rewire the stereo to work as a microphone. A group of boys begin to crash the party, including Jenny's crush, Ricky King. He takes her into the kitchen, where he steals a kiss from her, but she spurns him for not asking permission first, thus earning Patti's respect. Angered, he returns to his friends and they begin to wreak havoc in the living room. Mitch, severely weakened, enters the kitchen and discovers Patti and Diane on the counter before fainting, partially from his failure to take his medicine, and partially from the shock of seeing his miniature mother and aunt. Adam and Jenny discover him, and thinking quickly, Adam gets potassium-rich bananas to give to him, and he begins to recover, weakly saying he had seen his mother. In the living room, Adam stands up to Ricky before Wayne rewires the stereo so that Gordon can talk and amplify his voice. With this, he pretends to be the voice of God and orders Ricky and his friends to leave, leading Adam, Mitch, and Jenny to realize what has happened to them. In the attic, the kids discuss the benefits of leaving their parents shrunk briefly before deciding they love them more than that, so they unshrink them to give them a chance to re-evaluate their parenting methods. Patti confides her trust in Jenny for how she stood up to Ricky and took care of Mitch, while Wayne tells Adam that he can have an interest in sports, and agrees to sign him up for baseball camp. Diane tells Wayne he can keep the Tiki Man, and won't sweat the \"small\" stuff anymore, while he decides to relinquish his presidency of Szalinski Labs to Gordon and return to inventing. In the end, life is back to normal again. Adam returns home from baseball camp, and Wayne has developed a new respect for baseball, and the Tiki Man has been moved into the backyard and enlarged to twice the height of the house."

Commander Riker is chosen to lead the team, having been part of the rescue team that helped evacuate the base; Riker notes that during that mission he was the last person beamed out to the Potemkin, where he was serving. Using a break in the disruption field, the away team beams down and discovers a man who looks exactly like Riker. He says that he is Riker, and has been living alone on the base for eight years ever since the Potemkin was unable to transport him back aboard, under the assumption the Potemkin crew presumed him lost. He is a Starfleet Lieutenant, Senior Grade. This was Commander Riker's rank before he was promoted as a result of this mission. Returning to the Enterprise, Dr. Crusher determines that this person is truly a second Riker; Chief Engineer La Forge postulates that years before, while Riker was beamed off the planet, the Potemkin had split the transporter beam to cut through the distortions, but one beam was reflected back to the base, so that Riker materialized in both places. Cdr. Riker suggests that Lt. Riker join them on a second attempt to recover the data. At the base, their personality styles conflict, and the attempt ends in failure when Lt. Riker refuses to follow Cdr. Riker's orders.  Lt. Cdr. Data postulates that the two men are resentful towards each other due to the loss of their sense of uniqueness. Lt. Worf suggests another reason: each one sees in the other something of himself he does not like. While helping plan a third attempt to recover the data, Lt. Riker tries to learn about what he has missed, and attempts to rekindle his previous relationship with Ship's Counselor Deanna Troi. Troi has come to accept that her relationship with Riker is no longer a romantic one, and is initially hesitant, but then considers it a second chance. They enjoy their time together; and Lt. Riker suggests leaving the Enterprise together for a new posting. Troi tells him she will have to think about it. For their third attempt, Captain Picard selects Lt. Riker's plan over Cdr. Riker's, leaving Cdr. Riker further upset. The plan to get the data is successful, but on the way out a walkway collapses, putting Lt. Riker in mortal danger. Rescuing him would also put Cdr. Riker in peril, and Lt. Riker tells him not to risk it. But Cdr. Riker saves his double, and both return to the Enterprise. The two Rikers reconcile their differences; Lt. Riker states that he has been given a new assignment on another ship, and plans to take on his middle name \"Thomas\" to distinguish himself from William. As a parting gift, Cdr. Riker gives his double his treasured trombone, noting that it belongs equally to him. Troi also tells Lt. Riker that she will be staying on the Enterprise, but thanks him for the time they had."

On top of everything else, he has been pressured by his publisher to write another book. To the chagrin of his fans and publisher, Roger plans a novel based on his experiences in the Vietnam War, instead of another horror story, as a way to purge himself of the horrors that he had experienced while there. After his aunt's funeral, Roger decides to live inside her house to write instead of selling it, as recommended by the estate attorney. After moving in, Roger begins to have powerful graphic nightmares, including thoughts about his comrade, Big Ben, who died in Vietnam. In addition, strange phenomena spring forth from the house, haunting him in his waking hours. He tries communicating his fears to his next-door neighbor Harold Gorton who only thinks that Roger is crazy. One night while investigating a noise coming from his late aunt's bedroom, Roger is attacked by a deformed monster inside the closet. Soon, more attacks occur: levitating garden tools attack him, his wife appears and transforms into a hideous hag-like creature to attack him (whom he believes he kills), and gremlin creatures attempt to kidnap a neighbor's child whom Roger is reluctantly babysitting. Eventually, the author discovers an entry into a sinister other-world through the bathroom medicine cabinet and is pulled into the darkness, where he fortuitously locates his lost son Jimmy. Roger manages to escape with Jimmy but is soon confronted by an undead Big Ben who wants revenge on him; Ben was taken prisoner and tortured before dying, and he blames Roger for failing to kill him before he could be captured by the enemy. Roger confronts Ben, no longer afraid of his fears, and destroys him with a grenade as he and his son escape the burning house. In the end, he triumphantly glances back at the house while regaining control of his life and reunites with his wife and child."

A topic of Jefferson's private life was the long-rumored liaison between Jefferson and his mixed-race slave Sally Hemings. She was a half-sister to his late wife, and the daughter of John Wayles and his slave Betty Hemings; Sally was three-quarters white. The white historians gave all the reasons they believed Jefferson would not have done it. Black historians discussed \"reality and inevitability.\" Noted historian John Hope Franklin referred to all the mulattos of the period and said, \"These things [interracial liaisons] were part of the natural landscape in Virginia, and Mr. Jefferson was as likely as any others to have done this because it's in character with the times\u2014and indeed, with him, who believed in exploiting these people that he controlled completely.\" Following airing of this film, in 1998 a Y-DNA study showed a match between a descendant of Sally's youngest son, Eston Hemings, and a descendant of the male Jefferson line. Following a review of other historic evidence, this has led to a consensus among historians, including the Thomas Jefferson Foundation of Monticello, that Jefferson did have a long-term relationship with Hemings and fathered her children.

The focus transitions to police captain Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Karas, as he defuses a hostage situation by killing the hostage-takers. Afterwards Karas is given the job of solving the mystery surrounding Ilona's disappearance. Karas begins by contacting Dr. Jonas Muller, a former Avalon scientist familiar with her. Muller had been working to cure progeria, a genetic condition which affected his brother. Muller worked for Avalon as their top scientist but left after he failed to find a cure and his brother died. He took up new work at a free clinic. Muller tells Karas that \"No one ever leaves Avalon\", throwing the corporation under suspicion. Karas visits Paul Dellenbach, one of Avalon's CEOs and questions him about Ilona. On suggesting he may have been sleeping with her, Dellenbach replies \"I sleep with my wife, I sleep with my secretary, I even sleep with my sister-in-law but I would never sleep with one of my researchers\". After following a series of dead ends, control tells Karas they are tailing Illona's car through Paris. Eventually he captures the driver after a chase which ends at the Eiffel Tower. The man turns out to be a henchmen of Farfella, an Arab Muslim mobster and a childhood friend of Karas. The police captain returns the criminal to Farfella who in return gives him security footage of Illona's kidnapping; it shows her car being stolen by an incredibly old man. Karas asks Ilona's sister, Bislane, who works for Avalon to break into the company's Archives to discover what Muller was researching. Bislane discovers that a Dr. Nakata worked with Muller in a quest to find a cure for progeria. But they destroyed all evidence of their work when some of the children they were testing on started to mutate. Karas and Bislane then escape because accessing the closed file has alerted Avalon security. Later Karas opens up to Bislane and tells her that he and Farfella were raised in the casbah where they worked with gangs. After a drug run went wrong, they ended up in a holding cell. Farfella escaped but Karas was left to the mercy of the other gang. Karas puts Bislane under false arrest to protect her from Avalon. Meanwhile, Ilona is shown confined in a cyber ball which is being controlled by the old man. Eventually Karas tracks down Muller. He explains that he took Ilona because through her research she has discovered the secret to eternal life (as he himself did 40 years ago); but knowing what the consequences would be if Avalon acquired such knowledge, he kidnapped her. Karas tries to encourage the old scientist to hand himself in but Muller is mistakenly shot by a police marksman. Karas then deduces that the mysterious old man is Muller's younger brother: now immortal but trapped in an elderly body. Karas calls on Farfella who hides Bislane from Avalon while also getting a fake passport for Ilona. However the mega-corporation's security are also closing in on the Parisian sewer where Ilona is being held captive. After a short battle, Karas is mortally wounded rescuing Ilona. However she refuses to take the fake passport to start a new life. Instead she tells Karas she wants immortality by giving her discovery to Avalon. Reluctantly Karas shoots her in the back as she walks back towards Avalon security. CEO Dellenbach watches all this happen through a live feed from one of his men's helmet camera. As Karas lies dying, he imagines himself apologising to Bislane for killing her sister, for which she forgives him. The film closes with Muller's little brother living as a tramp, throwing his picture of him and his brother into a burning bin. The final scene shows an advert for Avalon with an old woman becoming young again saying, \"With Avalon, I know I'm beautiful and I'm going to stay that way.\""

French automaker Citro\u00ebn designed a car specially for the film, imagining what a Citro\u00ebn might look like in 2054. Volckman initially wanted Karas to drive a Citro\u00ebn DS and approached the company for permission to use it in the film.

He and his fianc\u00e9e Rita plan to get married soon. One day at work, he meets J.C., a hot-tempered entertainer and his crew, when he brings in his bike for repair. He sees a sidehack bike in the shop and takes a liking to it. Rommel offers J.C. and his group to join him in a sidehack event the upcoming weekend. At the event, J.C. enjoys watching Rommel race on the sidehack. Rommel offers J.C to give a ride on a sidehack with him at his and Rita's cabin, and he accepts. After a fun day of racing on Rommel's sidehack, everyone has a get together dinner party in the cabin. The party soon escalates when J.C. desperately offers Rommel to join his gang, who politely declines, and quickly loses his temper when Dirty John (one of his henchmen) tries asking him a question and Nero (another henchman of J.C.\u2019s) tries to calm his anger. After trying to seduce Rommel into joining again, his girlfriend, Paisley, reminds him that he's not interested. Further infuriated, everyone walks out of the cabin and J.C. takes out his anger on Paisley. The next day, while Rommel and Luke are working on a bike, Paisley comes over and tries to seduce Rommel into getting with her, wanting to get away from J.C., but he rejects her and sends her away crying.  Later, when J.C. and his men return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang  find Rommel and Rita in their cabin making love, and they beat Rommel unconscious. With Rommel out cold, they proceed to rape Rita, eventually killing her as a result. Luke finds out what happened to Rommel and his now-deceased fianc\u00e9e and informs the police. J.C., now on the verge of being a wanted man, has to hide himself in isolation. Despite Luke's warnings to let the police handle the situation, Rommel refuses to let go of what happened to his former fianc\u00e9e and wants revenge. Planning to kill J.C., he gathers a group of men to back him up, consisting of one of J.C.'s (now former) henchmen Nero (who joined Rommel after finally having enough of J.C.'s abuse), muscle-bound Big Jake, bailed out criminal Crapout, and another one of J.C.'s henchmen, Cooch (who's secretly working undercover for J.C.). With some help from Cooch, Rommel and his gang head out into the canyons where J.C. is hiding. Despite his wife's concerns about his safety, Luke goes after Rommel to stop him from getting his revenge. Meanwhile, Rommel discusses the plan on what they're going to do to kill J.C., which involves being stealthy, using their hands and no guns in spite of the risk that J.C.'s men may have some on them. They're reluctant on the plan, knowing the possibility of J.C.\u2019s men having guns, but they stick to it regardless. The next morning, Cooch sneaks over to J.C.'s hideout while everyone is still asleep and fills him in on what Rommel plans to do, and after he takes off, J.C. celebrates his victory with Paisley, thinking he has Rommel all figured out. However, Paisley breaks up with J.C. after putting up with all of his abuse and tries to escalate his fury with Rommel. Angry, he strangles Paisley to death, and then apologizes to her dead body and chides her for making him so angry. Luke, now caught up with Rommel, attempts to talk him out of getting his revenge on J.C., but he refuses and sticks with the plan. Suddenly, everyone sees Cooch sneaking back into the spot where they were sleeping, and Rommel, Big Jake, Nero and Crapout gang up on him trying to find out what's going on. Cooch feigns ignorance, and they beat him up to get him to talk. Finally giving in, he tells Rommel J.C. is hiding in a rock quarry in the canyons, and Rommel orders Crapout to tie him up. Rommel goes over to Luke and asks him to call the police to let them know where J.C. is hiding, finally acknowledging that going after J.C. isn't worth it. However, he still keeps a tied-up Cooch to his side while keeping an eye out on J.C. to make sure he doesn't escape from his hideout, as Rommel's men stick with their intended plan, resulting in Big Jake being killed after taking down two of J.C.'s men through stealth, and Cooch escaping, pleading J.C. not to kill Rommel, only for J.C. to kill his former weasel for being caught. With two of Rommel's men already killed, Nero and Crapout decide to play by their own rules and escape on a bike as the latter kills all of J.C.'s men with a gun instead of a battering ram as he originally planned to use, while J.C. attempts to shoot Rommel after Cooch exposed him. With Rommel and J.C. left in the quarry, no guns on them, the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind. The last images of the film are a flashback of Rommel and his fianc\u00e9e rolling about in a grassy field, superimposed over a shot of Rommel's dead body."

Darkness came when Lee Jong-tae (Lee Han-wi) and his son Soo-ho (Jae-ha's real name) appeared. The man stole money from Eun-young's mother, which was set aside for Eun-young's surgery. When Eun-young's mother travels to Seoul to look for Jong-tae, she dies in an accident. At the hospital where Eun-young is hospitalized, Jae-ha's foster mother Hyun Ji-sook (Geum Bo-ra) was also there due to her son's death.

It was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by Greg Daniels, who is also an executive producer, and the series' show runner. It first aired in the United States on April 27, 2006 on NBC. The episode guest stars Hugh Dane as Hank the security guard. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.  In the episode, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) finds pieces of a joint in the parking lot, and begins an investigation to find the owner. Michael Scott (Steve Carell), worrying that he may not pass a drug test, pressures Dwight for a cup of clean urine to pass the drug test. Failing to find the culprit and guilty over providing the urine to Michael, Dwight resigns as a volunteer sheriff. Later, Michael assigns Dwight the title of \"Honorary Security Adviser\". Several of the scenes were based on the actors' real-life talents, such as Krasinski's ability to impersonate people. The episode was also the final episode of the season to be filmed, though not the last to air. \"Drug Testing\" was watched by 7.8 million viewers and received mostly positive reviews from critics, although one review did criticize the plot for not quite coming together."

        "content": "Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) finds half of a joint in the parking lot of the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, and investigates its source in his capacity as volunteer sheriff deputy. When Dwight sets up urine testing, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) worries that a \"clove cigarette\" he smoked at a concert will show up. He conducts an anti-drug meeting for the office in an attempt to cast suspicion off himself and excuse himself from the drug test. When Dwight informs him there is no getting out of the test, he pressures Dwight for a cup of his \"clean\" urine, which he uses to pass the drug test. Deeming this a violation of his oath as sheriff deputy, Dwight turns in his badge. Michael feels guilty, so he makes Dwight an \"Honorary Security Advisor\" for Dunder Mifflin Scranton. When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) say the same thing simultaneously, Pam calls \"jinx\", meaning Jim cannot talk until he buys her a Coke. The vending machine is sold out, and Pam insists that by the rules Jim must remain silent. Jim holds up his end of the jinx, even when Pam torments him by encouraging Kelly to continue with a one-sided conversation with Jim. When Pam teasingly says to Jim \"you can tell me anything\", he gives her a yearning look, making her uncomfortable. Pam buys Jim his Coke, which he buys off of her so she can talk to him again. In a talking head interview, Jim discusses Dwight's sacrifice for Michael. He concludes, \"I just don't get it. What does he get out of that relationship?\" A cut-away emphasizes his own relationship with Pam."

        "content": "\"Drug Testing\" was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by show runner and executive producer Greg Daniels. Fischer noted that the subplot featuring Jim unable to talk was important because \"Pam and Jim can say a lot to one another without any words at all\", a reference to the \"27 seconds of silence\" the two shared in the earlier episode \"Booze Cruise\". Michael has a bandage around his finger in this episode because Steve Carell hurt his finger during the week and was unable to remove his wedding ring due to the swelling. Instead of cutting off his ring, the crew simply wrapped a bandage around it. Several of the scenes were based on the actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to \"write this down\", Jenna Fischer's response to the camera was improvised. \"I thought it was funny that I didn't have a pad of paper but Michael was telling me to take notes,\" she explained in her MySpace blog, \"so I just looked to the camera and showed my lack of pen and paper.\" Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set. This was the final episode of the season to be filmed, though not the last to air. According to Jenna Fischer, everybody on the set was excited in a manner that she likened to students on the last day of school. The giddiness particularly shows in Fischer's performance: Pam skips after Jim into the break room, she bounces on her toes at the end of the \"fake crying\" talking head, and she taps the soda can three times to get Jim to release the jinx. The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim doing impressions of Kevin and Angela for Pam, Dwight noting that he is so determined to find the culprit that he is prepared to pray \"to Thor himself\", Toby saying that he does not think Michael is taking drugs, Jim secretly doing an impression of Dwight right in front of him, Dwight talking about Jim and concluding that, \"If that were my life, I'd do drugs\", Pam toying with Dwight by admitting that she \"was a teensy bit high... in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy\", Meredith coming to Jim because Pam told her he had something to tell her. Jim is under the jinx and says nothing, Kelly putting a customer on hold when she is called by Dwight and forgetting to return, Dwight taking notes during the conference, Pam showing the camera the flyer that Michael made up for the conference, and Lee and Gino, the workers at Vance Refrigeration, discarding a joint in the parking lot."

She is hired by newspaper editor Deepak Suri (Boman Irani), and is assigned the task of reporting on celebrity news, writing articles for Page 3. Her roommate Pearl Sequiera (Sandhya Mridul) is an air hostess who aims to marry a rich man so that she can have a lavish, exciting lifestyle. Gayatri Sachdeva (Tara Sharma), an aspiring actress, later joins them at the apartment. Gayatri becomes romantically involved with a leading actor, Rohit Kumar (Bikram Saluja), and soon finds out that she is pregnant . Rohit is aware that the pregnancy will ruin his career so he tells her to get an abortion. Depressed and shattered, Gayarti unsuccessfully tries to commit suicide and, in the process, loses her child. Meanwhile, Pearl marries a wealthy old man and moves to the United States, where she lives an extravagant but loveless life. Madhavi plans to expose Rohit by writing an article on his relationship with Gayatri, but her editor blocks the story, and she is forced to apologize to Rohit. Madhavi finds out that her boyfriend is bisexual, when she finds him in bed with her best friend, Abhijeet (Rehaan Engineer). Soon, Madhavi becomes disillusioned with her job, and she realises that 'the party is over' for her - the celebrity lifestyle is not as glamorous as it seems. She requests to be moved to a different field, and lands on the \"crime beat\" with Vinayak Mane (Atul Kulkarni). She accompanies Vinayak as they search the city for crime related stories. On one such trip, they witness a bomb blast in the city, which affects Madhavi emotionally. She begins to investigate the story, but is made to cover a high-profile Bollywood party by Deepak. At the party, she comes across the ACP in charge of the bomb blast she witnessed, insensitively discussing the incident. Madhavi is shocked to find out that the ACP was attending a film shoot while he was on duty, which delayed his reaction to the blast. Vinayak goes to cover another news story in Nashik, Madhavi is asked to take charge of crime news. She learns that a number of boys from a rehabilitation home owned by Anjali Thapar have gone missing, and during the subsequent search, a number of boys could not be accounted for. The police find out that a group of boys are being held at the Thapar's private bungalow in Mud Island; but they do not have a search warrant. However, based on Madhavi's investigation, they conduct a raid. It is revealed that Ramesh Thapar has been molesting children from the rehabilitation home. Ramesh is arrested and police also find a connection to other corporate personalities who are involved in the scandal. Madhavi manages to capture the whole event on camera, and develops a breaking expos\u00e9 story. She asks Deepak to run the story as the headline article for the next day's news edition, and he promises to look into the piece and put it on the front page. However, that same night Deepak meets with the owner of the newspaper, Mr Agarwal, who is the best friend of Ramesh. Agarwal tells Deepak that the newspaper receives major advertisement revenue and other sponsorship from Ramesh. Fearing major loss to his business, Agarwal declines to publish the story, and asks Deepak to fire Madhavi from the company. Meanwhile, Gayatri, who supposedly turned her back on Bollywood and went back to Delhi, returns to Mumbai. In order to make a name for herself, she sleeps with a film director and gets cast in his next movie. Madhavi, who eventually gets a job as a Page 3 writer for another newspaper, realises that in the elite and extravagant lives of politicians, businessmen, film stars and socialites, there is no place for trust and honour."

He meets Daffy, who tells him of a pristine, uninhabited island in the Gulf of Thailand with a beautiful hidden beach. Daffy explains that he settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he left. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to Ko Samui. Richard meets two American surfers who have heard rumors of the island and gives them a copy of the map. En route to the island, Richard becomes infatuated with Fran\u00e7oise. After swimming to the island from a neighboring one, they find a cannabis plantation guarded by armed Thai farmers. Avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and meet Keatey, who brings them to a community of travelers living on the island in secret. Sal, the community's English leader, explains that the farmers allow them to stay so long as they keep to themselves and do not allow any more travelers to come to the island. Richard lies that they have not shown the map to anyone else. The trio become integrated into the community. One night, Fran\u00e7oise invites Richard to the beach where she tells him that she is falling in love with him and they make love. Despite hoping to keep it secret, the community finds out. While angry, \u00c9tienne says he will not stand in their way if Fran\u00e7oise is happier with Richard. Sal selects Richard to accompany her on a supply run to Ko Pha Ngan. They encounter the American surfers who are preparing to search for the island and mention Richard's map. Sal is upset but believes Richard when he says they have no map. In order to ensure that Sal will not tell the rest of the island about the map, Richard has sex with her at her order.  On their return to the island, Richard lies to Fran\u00e7oise about having had sex with Sal. When the surfers turn up on the neighboring island, Sal orders Richard to send them away and destroy their map. She tells everyone that she and Richard had sex, which leaves Fran\u00e7oise angry and heartbroken, causing her to return to \u00c9tienne. Isolated from the group, Richard begins to lose his sanity, imagining that he is conversing with the deceased Daffy. The surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the farmers. Shocked at witnessing their deaths, Richard gathers Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to leave the island. Richard is captured by the farmers along with Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne. The farmers are furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow any more newcomers. The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately. Sal pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. Shocked by her willingness to commit murder, the other members of the community abandon Sal, leave the island, and go their separate ways. Back in the United States, Richard receives an email at an Internet cafe from Fran\u00e7oise with a nostalgic group photograph of the beach community in happier times."

Bellick runs the name on the database, only to find no one matching it. Meanwhile, Sucre urges Stolte to let him call Maricruz (Camille Guaty), but is refused. Veronica (Robin Tunney) investigates who is framing Lincoln Burrows. She finds a tape, where she sees Lincoln shoot Terrence Steadman dead. Lincoln claims that he is being framed, stating the man was already dead and Lincoln never pulled the trigger. She attempts to talk to Crab Simmonds (Tab Baker), who didn't testify in his case, only to find out that he was killed of an apparent drug overdose. She is contacted by Leticia Barris (Adina Porter), Crab's girlfriend, but as they meet, she is spooked as Kellerman (Paul Adelstein) and Hale (Danny McCarthy) are watching. Back in Fox River, Michael attempts to get to a bolt from a bleacher belonging to T-Bag (Robert Knepper), but is stopped. He doesn't want Scofield on the bleacher unless he will join in the racist battle between the whites and blacks, but he declines. On his second attempt, T-Bag's gang take the bolt off him, so eventually, he decides to join in to get at the bolt. However, C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar) sees this, and when he confronts Scofield regarding the PUGNAc, he refuses to give the pills. Soon, everyone comes out of their cell for count, when the riot starts. Michael decides to get the bolt back from T-Bag's cellmate (Brian Hamman), and does so after a struggle. C-Note sees this and a black inmate stabs the cellmate several times; the wounded man dies in Michael's arms. T-Bag believes Michael killed the cellmate, and plans to get back at him. The fight stops through lockdown. Michael rubs the bolt until the end forms a hexagon shape key, big enough to unscrew the cell's toilet. It is explained that \"Allen\" is the screw, and \"Schweitzer\" is the lavatory. After the lockdown is finished, C-Note decides to give him the PUGNAc due to his take in the riot, and tells him he will eventually find out what he's up to. Michael takes it, where Dr. Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) gives him the test and finds out he is diabetic. Afterwards, Bellick takes Michael to an area, where Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) attempts to extract information regarding Fibonacci's whereabouts, but refuses to answer.

Bored with years of teaching, Anders retires and sets about putting together a team to pull off a diamond heist during the Rio Carnival in Brazil. With the help of a youthful friend, now a successful criminal, Anders recruits a team of four international experts to carry out the robbery: Gregg an English safecracking specialist, Agostino an Italian mechanical and electronics genius, Jean Paul a French playboy (whose job it is to seduce the only woman with a key to the building holding the diamonds, the lovely Mary Ann), and Erich a German ex-military man (at the movie's ending, it will become clear that Anders' young friend had ordered the German to kill the other members of the team after the job is finished). The team develops a series of mechanical devices to defeat the layers of protection built within the building in which the diamonds are stored, mainly photocells which crisscross the entry corridor, and the new \"Grand Slam 70\" safe system: an alarm triggered by any sound detected near the safe room by means of a sensitive microphone listens for sounds while the safe and its environs are secured. Although the presence of the latter system is found by the team only one day in advance and at first this seems to impose a stop to the entire action, Agostino is able to find a genial solution to overcome the problem, so that the action can start. The team successfully enters the safe using a pneumatic trestle to bypass the photocell beams by crawling over them, accesses to the safe room with the Mary Ann's key stolen by Jean Pauland, move the safe to the corridor using shaving cream to dampen their sounds, and finally open the safe with specific nitroglycerin charges. However, the following day the police are alerted by Mary Ann, who has found that the safe key had been temporarily taken, and all the four members of the team are killed during their escape. Anders ends up with the diamonds in a small letters case, sitting in an outdoor cafe...but loses them in the film's last scene in Rome to a thief gang on a motorcycle."

Meanwhile, the fraternities are pledging and a student said to have been interested in Doma Tau Omega is found dead on the campus. Chris, who has no high opinion of fraternities, gets to know a student of psychology, Megan, who invites him and Dan to a party of Doma Tau Omega, saying that she does not want to go there alone. However, when they arrive at the party, Chris seems to be interested only in the leader of DTO, Devon Eisley, and approaches him. After waiting for Chris a long time, Megan and Dan leave the party. Chris, meanwhile, is made drunk by Devon, who then makes him a member of DTO by drinking a bit of his blood while, in turn, Chris has to drink a bit of Devon's. Shortly after that, Chris is introduced to parties in the DTO house, where he and Devon drink blood from a girl called Sandy in a way reminiscent of sexual intercourse. Dan is unsettled by the change in Chris since joining the fraternity, and breaks into the DTO house. Investigating the book of DTO, Dan is shocked to find photos of Devon throughout the decades of the fraternity's history, completely unchanged. He persuades Megan to go with him to Chris' room, which they find totally ravaged. They decide to look for Chris at the fraternity house. At the DTO house, Devon tells Chris that he lives eternally as long as he transforms his soul into a new body every century, and that this time, Chris would be the one whose body is used. The student found dead on campus was made to commit suicide, as he was afraid to participate in the ceremony and threatened to go public. Chris tries to flee but is knocked out by the other DTO members, Barry and Jordan. Dan and Megan try to enter the fraternity house, but their way is blocked by DTO member Mikhail who threatens them with an axe. Dan grabs the needle used by the fraternity members to get blood from their victims and thrusts in into Mikhail's neck, killing him. In the house, Dan and Megan meet Berry, Jordan, Devon and Chris, who are already beginning the ceremony. Megan reveals herself as a decoy who has worked for Devon over the last 70 years and was tasked with luring Chris. She threatens Dan with the axe, saying that she will kill him if Chris tries to resist the ritual. Chris stops fighting and kneels down in front of Devon. While everyone is concentrating on Chris, Dan suddenly breaks free of Megan. He takes the axe, and attacks Devon with it. Devon, the other fraternity members and Megan all die, leaving Chris and Dan standing amongst the carnage. Dan asks why Chris did not die, and Chris answers, \"I told you I would never join a fraternity.\" The two leave the house."

        "content": "Dutch Dooley attends a ritzy party with his girlfriend, Natalie Standish. He stands out terribly among the upper-class aristocrats \u2013 wearing a cheap suit and making boorish comments. Natalie's relaxed, less rigid personality also does not fit with the rest of the patrons. Dutch also meets Natalie's snobbish, wealthy ex-husband Reed, who tells Natalie that he will have to break his Thanksgiving plans with their son Doyle for an unexpected business trip to London. Natalie calls Doyle at his private school in Georgia and invites him home for Thanksgiving, but Doyle refuses the offer, solely blaming his mother for the divorce. Despite this, Dutch sees an opportunity to get to know Doyle and further his relationship with Natalie, so he offers to go to Georgia and bring Doyle back to Chicago for the holidays. Upon arriving in Georgia, Dutch finds Doyle to be much like his father: snobbish, selfish and elitist. He welcomes Dutch by throwing a book at his face, hitting him with a golf club, kicking him and shooting him in the groin with a BB gun, for which Dutch promises revenge. Dutch ultimately hogties Doyle to a hockey stick and carries him to the car to start on the drive back home. The trip entails several mishaps, including an impromptu fireworks show that sees Dutch's coat destroyed. Later, after Doyle throws a lit cigar in Dutch's lap, Dutch throws Doyle out of the car and makes him walk to the next motel by himself. Doyle gets even by parking Dutch's car in the middle of the highway, where it is hit and totaled by a truck. They hitch a ride with two prostitutes who steal their luggage and Dutch's wallet, leaving them stranded. Doyle calls his father, whom he discovers has lied about his trip to London; he instead spent the holidays with a girlfriend. Stunned by his father's betrayal, and wounded by Dutch's accusation that he \"hates his mother\", Doyle begins to regret his callous attitude. Dutch initially gives up and wants to call Natalie for assistance, but Doyle refuses and insists on getting home on their own. They sneak a ride on the back of a semi-truck and are assaulted by security guards at a trailer drop yard; Doyle brandishes his BB gun and feigns insanity, pretending that voices in his head are telling him to kill the guards, which frightens them enough to allow their escape. The two enter a restaurant, where they meet a married couple who takes them to a homeless shelter in Hammond, Indiana for the night. At the shelter, Doyle grows fond of a young girl and her family. While getting to know them, he finally realizes that he has been neglecting his mother and indeed wants to be with her for the holidays. The next day, the family drives Dutch and Doyle to Natalie's home, where Reed is waiting. Doyle reunites with his mother and reveals to Reed that he knows the truth about his trip to London. When Doyle decides to stay with his mother instead of Reed for Thanksgiving, Reed evicts Natalie from the house, which he owns. Dutch follows Reed outside as he departs and hits Reed in the forehead with his pinky ring. He then demands that Reed show more respect to Natalie and become a better father to Doyle, to which a dazed Reed agrees. As Natalie, Dutch and Doyle sit down to begin their Thanksgiving feast, Dutch asks Doyle to retrieve Dutch's coat, as it contains a very special gift for Natalie. As Doyle walks away, Dutch pulls the BB gun Doyle originally shot him with and finally gets his revenge by shooting him in the groin."

The episode was written by re-imagined creator Ronald D. Moore, and directed by Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. It first aired on October 6, 2006 on the Sci-Fi Channel along with the following episode \"Precipice\". In the episode, the Cylons are in their fourth month of a military occupation on New Caprica, where the majority of the human population are residing. A resistance movement is trying to drive the Cylons away. Meanwhile, Admiral William Adama continues his plan to rescue everybody there. Unlike most episodes up to this point, it does not include a survivor count, leaving it unclear as to how many died when several ships were destroyed in the previous episode. The story behind the episode was inspired by several wars and occupations in the past, including the Quartering Acts and the Iraq War. Several parts of the episode changed from the script, more predominantly the scenes involving a suicide bombing. The producers were worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the scene. The episode was seen by 2.2 million viewers and attracted generally positive reactions from critics. In addition, Moore's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and a Writers Guild of America award."

A few thousand humans had escaped in the remaining spaceships following Battlestars Galactica and Pegasus. Admiral William Adama (Edward James Olmos) is continuing to work on a plan to free those trapped on New Caprica. His son and commander of Pegasus Lee \"Apollo\" Adama (Jamie Bamber) confronts his father on pushing his Viper pilots beyond the breaking point, to which Adama says Apollo is becoming \"soft.\" Apollo's wife, Anastasia Dualla (Kandyse McClure) surprises him by supporting the Admiral. On New Caprica, Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) is placed in an elaborate prison cell made to look like her old apartment on Caprica by Leoben Conoy (Callum Keith Rennie), who is attempting to force her to fall in love with him. Starbuck kills him several times, though Leoben always downloads into another body. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) is in a Cylon detention facility, where his right eye was forcibly removed. He is released when his wife Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) performs sexual favors for the Cylon Brother Cavil (Dean Stockwell). Tigh returns to Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco) and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), who have been leading a resistance movement against the Cylons, having detonated a bomb in a Cylon docking facility as Tigh is released. Now free, Tigh resorts to escalating their efforts, by planning suicide bombings against the Cylons and any human collaborators. The resistance is given intelligence by an unidentified informant from the Cylon command structure, by use of a secret dead drop; flipping a dog bowl and hiding some documents inside the tent next to it. One piece of intelligence given is information on a Cylon communications blocker; the resistance makes use of that information to contact a Raptor orbiting the planet. The Raptor returns to Galactica with news they have made contact with the resistance on the planet. Next, the resistance plans to kill the President of the Colonies, Gaius Baltar (James Callis), who is unwillingly collaborating with the Cylons. They learn he is to attend a graduation ceremony for the New Caprica Police, an unpopular masked police force set up by the Cylons to allow the humans to police the city and do the Cylons' bidding. Tucker \"Duck\" Clellan (Christian Tessier), who has access to the ceremony and whose wife had been killed by the Cylons, agrees to suicide bomb the ceremony. Towards the end of the episode it is revealed that Baltar's aide, Felix Gaeta (Alessandro Juliani) is the informant. He learns that Baltar will not be attending the ceremony, but cannot alert the resistance in time. Duck attends the ceremony, and when Number Three (Lucy Lawless) comes to shake his hand, Duck detonates the bomb, killing everybody in the room."

        "title": "Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)_Writing",
        "content": "\"Occupation\", and following episode \"Precipice\" were written by series creator Ronald D. Moore. The Cylon occupation of New Caprica, and the human resistance fighting them, was inspired by wars and military occupations from history, including the Quartering Acts, World War II, and the more recent occupation in Iraq. In the original writing, Moore did not originally consider including Tigh with an eye removed until the final drafts were written. Portraying actor Michael Hogan was initially hesitant with the idea. He recalled that when the producers called him to talk about how his character would be maimed, they suggested having an eye removed. Hogan responded by laughing, and the producers assumed he agreed. When Anders and Tyrol detonate the bomb at the beginning of the episode, one of the Number Three (D'anna) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin's (Mary McDonnell) school at the time, but that was cut. Also, Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end, but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife's death. In the original drafts, the resistance was not planning suicide bombings, but \"freaking the Cylons out\" by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison, torture them for information, and leave them alive instead of killing them, as they would resurrect otherwise. This would make the Cylons worry about their missing comrades. However, Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be \"really potent and really powerful.\" When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing, Moore got \"emotionally caught up in it,\" adding \"as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks, we know he's got the belt on. What's he gonna do? And then, oh my God, he actually does it. I mean, it's really horrifying stuff. But it's true. That's why I want to do it. It really happens. People do this.\" The producers were initially worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the bombing scene, but to Moore's surprise, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern did not object to it. There was some debate among the writers on when Galactica and the fleet would be brought into the story. Moore decided to reintroduce the space-bound fleet in the beginning of the third act, in order to establish the story on New Caprica, and make the audience happy and more excited to see Galactica. Moore also decided to evolve one of the Number Eight Cylon models, Sharon Agathon (Grace Park) imprisoned on board the ship, where a year would allow Sharon and Admiral Adama to form a special relationship, eventually leading to Adama releasing her and allowing her to become a Colonial officer by the next episode. Moore felt \"Occupation\" was the best season premiere of Battlestar since \"33\", the first-season premiere, believing the writers \"never quite matched\" the performance on \"33\" in the following episodes. He also felt it was a better premiere than \"Scattered\" from the second season, as it contained disparate story lines where the characters were not fully reunited with each other until a few episodes in."

Landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). He claims no knowledge of Komomo, but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room. Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her lover never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past \u2014 her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously \u2014 underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums \u2014 she hanged herself in torment, tired of waiting for her lover. Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth.  The girl starts again, and in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist. She was taken in by a Buddhist priest, who, presumably, molested her and inspired an obsession with hell. Her father never died of lung disease \u2014 she beat him to death for raping her. Again she tells of being sold into prostitution, but gives a new version of the dark fate of Christopher's beloved Komomo. Despite the kindness of Komomo, who befriended her, the disfigured girl stole the jade ring and planted Komomo's hairpin to frame her \u2014 and after Komomo was tortured, killed her. She explains to Christopher that she intended to save Komomo from hell: as Komomo would be doomed for having such an evil friend, only through betrayal could she sever the friendship and ensure Komomo a deservedly beautiful afterlife. Christopher, losing control, is desperately convinced something has been left out. He begs for the whole truth. The woman then reveals a horrifying secret: a tiny second head in the center of a hand hidden beneath her hair \u2014 her \"Little Sis\", a parasitic twin, the woman's identity now partly revealed as that of a Futakuchi-onna, a type of supernatural being. Her mother and father had been brother and sister; \"Little Sis\" was the fruit of their incest. It was \"Little Sis\" who commanded her to kill her father, and to steal the ring. As the hand begins to talk like Komomo in a high-pitched voice, Christopher is overcome by madness and threatens to shoot her and send her to hell. She informs him that wherever he goes, he will be in hell - a flashback implies that he was responsible for his sister's death. He shoots the girl in the heart and then the head. Before dying, the girl's body turns into Komomo. The epilogue finds Christopher in a Japanese prison serving time for the murder of the girl. When he is given a water ration, he hallucinates the bucket contains an aborted fetus, and cradles the bucket while singing a lullaby, kept company only by the ghosts of Komomo and his dead sister."

Considered to be a \"deliberately and spectacularly transgressive director whose work is lionized by a substantial share of the young generation of Internet critics and horror film fans, while routinely rejected as repulsively sadistic by much of the mainstream media\", Miike crafted \"Imprint\" based on a traditional Japanese story, \"Bokkee Kyotee\", by Shimako Iwai.

It's a story that could have been told before the horror genre was around \u2013 it's more like a kaidan \u2013 a traditional scary story.\" It included graphic depictions of violence and aborted fetuses, but Miike believed he was staying within the boundaries of acceptability: \"I thought that I was right up to the limit of what American television would tolerate. As I was making the film I kept checking to make sure that I wasn't going over the line, but I evidently misestimated.\" After previewing the episode, Mick Garris, the series creator and executive producer, requested that it be edited to tone down the content, but, despite some changes being made, Showtime felt it was too disturbing to air on television.

Police converge on the night club, but the officers, including cynical NYPD Lieutenant John Moss, are unable to stop the murder. The Party Crasher flees in the ensuing chaos, and Moss is thrown off a car while trying to stop the killer. While Moss has his injuries tended to, he makes obscene comments to the media. In Hollywood, Nick Lang is a pampered  and capricious movie star who is best known as \"Smoking\" Joe Gunn, the Indiana Jones-like title character in a series of highly popular action films. In order to be taken more seriously as an actor, he is vying for the leading role in the heavy cop drama Blood on the Asphalt, which he believes will be a more realistic role. Nick vows to \"prepare\" for the role by attempting to act as an actual police officer with the rest of the NYPD. After seeing Moss's outburst on television, Nick pulls strings with New York City Mayor David Dinkins to be assigned as Moss's new partner. Moss wants no part of the deal, but is forced to comply by his captain, who is a Nick Lang fan. To make matters worse, looking after Nick means that Moss will have to be removed from the Party Crasher case. Moss defies orders by continuing the investigation and repeatedly trying to ditch Nick, whose constant questions and attempts to mimic Moss's movements infuriate Moss. Nick wants to know what it feels like to be a cop, while Moss constantly reminds him that this is not a movie. Meanwhile, Moss is also trying to juggle a new romance with Susan, a single mother. The divorced Moss is unable to communicate with her or open up, and Nick offers advice to him on how to interact with women. Moss is embarrassed even further when Nick, as Ray Casanov, appears at a pizza parlor and is a hit with Bonnie, Susan's daughter, who dislikes Moss. Moss takes Nick to a dark building to catch a perp, ordering him to stay put and giving him a real gun in case of an emergency. Nick, however, enters the building and shoots a man who he believes is a criminal chasing Moss. The man is revealed to be a bystander, leaving Nick terrified. Moss agrees to cover up the act, and urges Nick to leave town immediately. Nick returns from the airport to the police station to confess, only to see that the \"dead man\" is actually a cop. Moss choreographed the stunt to get Nick out of town, stating that Nick's panic, self-doubt, guilt, and anger are all part of being a \"real\" cop. Nick tracks Moss down and stumbles into a confrontation between Moss and The Party Crasher, during which he saves Moss's life. The Party Crasher is wounded, but he kills several people and escapes. After Moss is told by Susan that his unstable life as a cop will never allow them to have a relationship, he is visited by Nick. Nick predicts that The Party Crasher will follow storytelling protocol and seek out Moss's loved ones in the third act of their story together. Nick is right, and Susan is abducted. Moss and Nick confront The Party Crasher on a billboard, advertising Nick's latest movie Smoking Gunn II, and a brawl ensues. Susan is saved after Nick intervenes and is shot in the chest. Moss throws the Party Crasher off the roof to his death. Moss tries to comfort Nick and gives an impressive speech about being a cop. Several months later, Nick has recovered and filmed The Good, The Badge and The Ugly. Moss, now married with Susan, attends the movie's premiere with the rest of the department and is annoyed to discover that Nick's best lines in the film originally came from him."

The consensus said, \"The Hard Ways overly familiar formula is enlivened by a witty script and the excellent comedic chemistry between Michael J. Fox and James Woods.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times said that it is \"not a perfect comedy by any means, but it is a very entertaining one\" and commended its \"pure Hollywood\" sensibility, writing that it is \"sometimes slapdash in execution and sloppy in coherence, but it's written, directed and performed with a redeeming, self-mocking zest.\" Time Out called it a \"light, bright comedy\" that \"counterbalances Hollywood convention with some very funny swipes at the film industry\" and stated, \"Badham handles the numerous action sequences with confidence, but the real enjoyment comes from the interplay between the two leads, who revel in the opportunity to send up their images.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it three-and-a-half out of four stars and praised its \"comic energy\", calling the film \"funny, fun, exciting, and [...] an example of professionals who know their crafts and enjoy doing them well.\" Ebert said the stunts, special effects, and second unit work  were \"all seamless and exciting\", and viewed that the actors elevate the film's plot with their performances: Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C rating and criticized it as having \"coyly self-conscious high concept\", writing that \"takes the [action-buddy-cop genre] to such a numbing dead end.\" Burr panned its chase scenes and editing as \"visual nonsense\" and called its plot \"all guns and gag lines\", although he found Fox \"secure enough to goof on his own image and inventive enough to do it well\"."

        "content": "In 1944, with the help of Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin, the Nazis build a dimensional portal off the coast of Scotland and intend to free the Ogdru Jahad to aid them in defeating the Allies. Rasputin opens the portal with the aid of his disciples, Ilsa von Haupstein and Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. An Allied team destroys the portal, guided by a young scientist named Trevor Bruttenholm (colloquially known as \"Broom\"). The German team is killed and the portal is destroyed, in the process absorbing Rasputin, while Haupstein and Kroenen escape. The Allied team discovers that an infant demon with a right hand of stone has come through the portal; they dub him \"Hellboy\" and Bruttenholm adopts him. 60 years later, the eternally youthful Kroenen and Haupstein resurrect Rasputin. FBI agent John Myers is transferred to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) at the request of Bruttenholm, where he meets the adult Hellboy and a psychic, amphibious humanoid named Abe Sapien. Hellboy is sent to investigate an incident at a Museum and battles a creature named Samael. After defeating it, Hellboy visits former BPRD member Liz Sherman at a mental hospital that she committed herself to due to her unstable pyrokinetic abilities. Abe learns that Samael was resurrected by Rasputin, who has imbued Samael with the power to reincarnate and split his essence, causing two of the creature's eggs to hatch and mature each time one dies. Abe also learns that Bruttenholm is dying. Concluding the eggs are in the sewer, Hellboy, Abe and several FBI agents go down to destroy them. Abe is injured while looking for the eggs, while Kroenen kills most of the agents. Kroenen, whose mutilated body is run by mechanical parts, shuts himself down, pretending to be defeated, and is brought to the bureau. FBI Director Tom Manning is angered by Hellboy's recklessness. Myers takes Liz out for coffee and to talk. Hellboy, jealous, covertly follows them, leaving the bureau unguarded. Kroenen reanimates himself and Rasputin appears at the bureau, confronting Bruttenholm. Rasputin offers him a vision of the future, showing Hellboy is the agent that will destroy the world. However, Bruttenholm tells Rasputin he will always see Hellboy as his son. Rasputin, respecting Bruttenholm for raising Hellboy, directs a quick execution by Kroenen. Bruttenholm dies holding a rosary. Manning takes over the BPRD and locates Rasputin's mausoleum in an old cemetery outside Moscow, Russia. A team led by Manning and Hellboy enters the mausoleum, but swiftly becomes separated. Hellboy and Manning find their way to Kroenen's lair and kill him. Hellboy reunites with Liz and Myers at Samael's new nest, but the creatures overwhelm them. Liz uses her pyrokinetic powers to incinerate the creatures and their eggs. Hellboy, Liz and Myers lose consciousness and are captured by Rasputin and Haupstein. Rasputin sucks Liz's soul out of her body, then tells Hellboy to release the Ogdru Jahad in return for her soul. Hellboy awakens his true power as Anung un Rama, causing his horns to regrow, and begins to release the Ogdru Jahad. Myers breaks out of his restraints, subdues Haupstein, and reminds Hellboy that he can defy his destiny, throwing him Bruttenholm's rosary. Remembering his true self and what Bruttenholm brought him up to be, Hellboy breaks off his horns, reseals the Ogdru Jahad and defeats Rasputin by stabbing him with one of his broken-off horns. However, Rasputin has been possessed by the Behemoth, a spawn of the Ogdru Jahad which bursts out of his body, grows to enormous size, and destroys him and Haupstein. Hellboy allows himself to be swallowed by the beast, then detonates a belt of hand grenades and destroys it from the inside. He whispers something in Liz's ear and she is revived. When she asks how her soul was returned, Hellboy replies that he said \"Hey, you on the other side, let her go, because for... for her I'll cross over, and then you'll be sorry.\" Liz and Hellboy share a kiss."

        "content": "The film starts at some fourteen years after Fereshteh (Niki Karimi) and Roy\u0101 (Meril\u0101 Z\u0101re'\u00ed) became friends, while studying architecture at a university in Tehran. Fereshteh's husband is in the ICU and she needs Roya's help. The events in the life of Fereshteh over the course of the preceding fourteen years are revealed through a series of flashbacks that represent Feresheh's and Roy\u0101's reminiscences. Fereshteh, whose family lives in reduced circumstances in Esfahan, is an excellent student who brims with hopes and expectations for her future and what she would do for her family on graduating. A voracious reader, she seems to know almost everything and is ready to face any difficulty, she has no interest in marrying just yet but instead wants to build a successful career. Fereshteh supports herself financially through giving private tuitions to fellow students. Roy\u0101's family, on the other hand, are wealthy. She becomes one of Fereshteh's private pupils and through this a deep friendship develops between the two. Fereshteh is stalked by an obsessive young man, named Hassan (Mohammad-Rez\u0101 Foroutan), who stops at nothing for gaining her attention and, as he puts it, marrying her. He stirs up many problems, including inflicting serious bodily harm by throwing acid to Fereshteh's cousin on mistaking him as Fereshteh's boyfriend. This prompts Fereshteh's father (Rez\u0101 Kh\u0101nd\u0101n) forcing her to return to their home in Esfahan (although Fereshteh lives independently in a university dormitory, she is formally in the care of her uncle, her father's brother, who lives in Tehran); through some inverted logic, the father believes that the actions of the stalker must have been provoked by some impropriety on the part of his daughter. These events take place at the time when the universities are being closed by the government of Iran (which in reality took place in the second half of 1979) so that Fereshteh does not see her departure from Tehran as life-changing, but as a temporary event with no consequence for her studies and her future plans. The stalker follows Fereshteh to Esfahan and during a motorcycle-car chase causes a fatal accident involving two children playing football on street. The ultimately causes the stalker to be sentenced to 13 years in prison - as he's dragged away to prison he vows to kill Fereshteh when he's released. A man, named Ahmad (Atila Pesiani), who helps Fereshteh and her family with the legal case and fees ensuing this accident, asks Fereshteh's hand and despite Fereshteh's initial fierce opposition to the proposal, by promising to be supportive of Fereshteh's plan to pursue her studies following the opening of universities, succeeds in gaining Fereshteh's consent and the two marry. After the marriage, he proves to be an utterly jealous husband who bars Fereshteh from having any contact with the outside world that he does not approve of, including association with Roy\u0101; although he does not know Roy\u0101 at all, he feels a visceral hatred towards her, believing that she represents the liberal society that he finds so detestable. When Fereshteh applies to court for divorce, the presiding judge dismisses the case outright, stating that none of the actions of her husband, that suffocate her both emotionally and intellectually, were sufficient for the court to grant divorce. The judge's decision is based on Fereshteh answering a series of questions, such as whether her husband was violent, whether he was unfaithful, whether he had drugs additions, etc., in the negative; in response to Fereshteh's repeated pleas and appeal to her being a human being, the judge retorts not to waste the time of the court. It is remarkable that although one never sees Ahmad beating Fereshteh, in reality he is a violent man, as he constantly verbally abuses Fereshteh and often brandishes a kitchen knife while doing so; this is Mil\u0101ni's subtle way of showing how domestic violence is often not recognized even by its very victims. Fereshteh and her husband have two sons (both in their teens when Fereshteh and Roy\u0101 meet after fourteen years) who outwardly love both parents equally, but inwardly stand on the side of their mother, who, amongst others, teaches them to the best of her ability. Fereshteh tries to leave her husband multiple times but events conspire against her and she's unable to do so, until 13 years have passed and the stalker is once again at her doorstep. Finally after yet fight with her controlling husband (he finds out she's been secretly acquiring and reading books, including those about childcare) she runs out of her home, chased by Ahmad. She's able to temporarily make headway, but runs into her old stalker instead. Giving up, she tells the stalker to kill her like he wants to - Ahmad intervenes and is stabbed instead. This is the incident that has landed him in the ICU at the beginning of the movie. As Fereshtah finishes telling her story to Roya, the phone rings and they are informed of Ahmad's death. Fereshteh is upset yet for the first time in years she sees a hopeful light ahead. She says she didn't want Ahmad to die despite all he did, but now that he is dead she has so much to do - go back to university, earn and be both parents to her sons. With increasing excitement she talks about reading books, learning to drive, learning computers. Finally she asks Roya to help her find books about single mothers raising their children alone."

As Michael is very socially awkward and also has an overly active imagination, he has trouble making friends at school. He is also prone to extremely weird dreams, such as dreaming that he has jumped into bed, only for it to collapse into a pool of blood. Emotionally distraught from the move and the dreams, Michael is traumatized by accidentally viewing his parents having sex (he believes that he is seeing them biting into one another) and by viewing his father cutting into a corpse in the Division of Human Testing at Toxico, where Nick is developing a chemical defoliant (like Agent Orange) for use in jungles. As time progresses, Michael begins to suspect that his parents are cannibals, after he discovers (or dreams that he discovers) body parts hanging on a meat hook in the basement. Michael is convinced that what he has seen is true, much to the chagrin of his school guidance counselor, Millie Dew. One afternoon, Millie goes home with Michael in order to convince him that he is imagining everything, only for the two of them to find a corpse in the basement. Michael runs up to his room while Millie, hiding in the pantry, is found and killed. When Nick and Lily arrive home, Michael attacks his father. Later that evening, Nick tries to feed Michael (possibly human) meat, assuring him that he will develop a taste for it like his mother did, while Lily smiles in agreement, but he fights back and manages to stab his father in the shoulder. Nick then tries to kill Michael, only for Lily to try to protect Michael and die in the process. Michael is then chased around the house by his injured father, who accidentally runs into a gas line due to his injuries. Nick breaks the gas line and then runs into a shelf of wine bottles, which he pulls down onto him and presumably dies. As gas fills the room, Michael has barely enough time to escape before the gas ignites and blows up the house. The film ends with Michael's paternal grandparents assuming his care. After placing him to bed, Michael's grandparents leave him a midnight snack consisting of a glass of milk and a suspicious-looking meat sandwich, implying perhaps that his father learned cannibalism from his parents."

His gifts do not extend to grades, however, and he receives rejection letters from all the colleges to which he applies, including those with high acceptance rates. To gain approval from his demanding father (Mark Derwin), Bartleby creates a fake college, the South Harmon Institute of Technology (SHIT). His best friend, Sherman Schrader III (Jonah Hill), who has been accepted into his father's (Jim O'Heir) prestigious alma mater, Harmon College, aids Bartleby and fellow reject Rory Thayer (Maria Thayer), who only applied to Yale University and was rejected due to legacy preferences; Darryl \"Hands\" Holloway (Columbus Short), who lost his athletic scholarship after an injury; and Glen (Adam Herschman), who has a low GPA and failed his SAT  due to stupidity. To make the \"college\" seem legitimate, Bartleby convinces Sherman to create a functional website for the school. When his father insists on meeting the dean, Bartleby hires Sherman's peculiar uncle, Dr. Ben Lewis (Lewis Black), a former philosophy professor at Harmon College, to play that role, and he leases an abandoned psychiatric hospital adjacent to Harmon College and renovates it to look like a college campus. Their plan backfires when the website, which automatically accepts any applicant, enrolls hundreds of other rejected students. Bartleby realizes that these people have nowhere else to go, so he lets them believe that the school is real, a place where they will finally feel accepted, despite objections from his friends. After a visit to Harmon disenchants him with traditional college life, he decides to let the students create their own curriculum; this ranges from the culinary arts, sculpting, meditation, to unusual courses such as psychokinesis, a subject one eccentric kid (Jeremy Howard) wishes to study. Bartleby creates a school newspaper (the SHIT Rag) and invents a mascot (the SHIT Sandwiches), while Lewis gives lectures about life; the students primarily spend their time partying. Meanwhile, the narcissistic dean of Harmon College, Richard Van Horne (Anthony Heald), makes plans to construct the Van Horne Gateway, a park-like walkway similar to Yale and Harvard's, hoping to make Harmon look more prestigious and increase their number of rejected students. He dispatches Hoyt Ambrose (Travis Van Winkle) to free up the nearby properties, but when Bartleby refuses to relinquish the lease for the South Harmon property, Hoyt tries to reveal the college as a fake. The dispute turns personal, as Bartleby has been vying for the affections of Hoyt's ex-girlfriend, Monica Moreland (Blake Lively). Hoyt exposes South Harmon as a fake institution through Sherman, who is attempting to join Hoyt's fraternity as a legacy but is constantly humiliated and abused by them. After debasing Sherman once more, the fraternity violently forces him to hand over all the files he has created for South Harmon. Hoyt contacts all the students' parents, and with Van Horne, reveals the school is a sham. Soon after, the school is forced to close, and Bartleby is at risk of prison time for fraud. However, Sherman, who has had enough with Harmon College's corruption, files for accreditation for South Harmon, giving Bartleby a chance to make his college legitimate. At the subsequent State of Ohio educational accreditation hearing, Bartleby makes an impassioned speech about the failures of conventional education and the importance of following one's own passions, convincing the board to grant his school a one-year probationary accreditation to test his new system and make the school adequate, thus foiling Van Horne's schemes. The college reopens, renovated and with more students enrolling, including Sherman and Monica. In addition, Bartleby finally earns the approval of his father, who is proud his son now owns a college. As the film closes, Van Horne walks to his car in the parking lot, only to watch it suddenly explode. Bartleby watches in astonishment (or perhaps fear) as the eccentric student from earlier makes his interest in psychokinetic explosion a reality."

Although the lessons seem harsh, Cliff makes it clear that his instruction is an attempt to convince him that it is important to try his best. Cliff is troubled upon meeting Denise's (Lisa Bonet) latest admirer (Todd Hollowell) who is a former merchant marine and Turkish prisoner."

His younger sister Vanessa was trying to get Theo in trouble for throwing food at her as well. Dr. Cliff Huxtable comes home from a long day at his job as an obstetrician/gynecologist just after the meal. Cliff confronts Theo about his poor grades and asks how he plans to get into college with such grades. When Theo replies that he's not planning to go to college, Cliff replies \"Damn right.\"  Theo explains that he just plans to get a job after school as a regular person.  Cliff uses play money from a Monopoly game to show just how far a \"regular person\"'s income would actually go in the adult world. Cliff gives him an amount of money representing a generous monthly salary for a \"regular person\". He then takes money out of Theo's hand in amounts representing various costs such as housing, food, clothes, transportation and finally a girlfriend, until there is nothing left. Cliff also meets Denise's earring-wearing beau, who had recently been in a Turkish prison. When Cliff tells his daughter about what time he expects her home and what attire she should wear, she scoffs at the notion since it is a Friday night and thus, \"not a school night.\" Cliff responds by asking her if she went to school that day and that it was a \"school night.\" Theo responds that he should accept his son's weaknesses and love him unconditionally because they are father and son\u2014a typical sentimental idiom in family sitcoms of that time, and one which generated the typical applause from the studio audience.  Cliff, however, to the audience's surprise and amused approval, immediately and angrily calls this sentiment \"the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life\". He completely rejects the notion that loving his son means he must quietly and willingly accept it when the boy does not give his best effort in school, and famously threatened him with the often quoted line, \"I brought you in this world, and I'll take you out.\" Cliff then tells his son that he expects him to work to his potential and tells Theo that he loves him. At the end of the day, Clair and Cliff settle into bed. As he becomes amorous, she reminds him that was how they got all those troublesome kids. This puts him off for a few seconds. Then Vanessa and Rudy knock on the bedroom door because Rudy was scared of \"the Wolf Man\" in their closet. Clair invites the kids to sleep with her and Cliff."

        "content": "The story begins in a small Highland school classroom. Geordie MacTaggart is a \"wee\" (small) Scottish schoolboy, and the son of a gamekeeper. Although his best friend Jean does not mind his height, after he sees a newspaper advertisement for a bodybuilding correspondence course offered by Henry Samson, he sends for the course and embarks diligently on Samson's fitness programme. By the time Geordie turns 21, he has grown into a tall, fit man who continues to follow Samson's long-distance instructions. Jean, however, disapproves of the amount of time he spends training. Geordie works as assistant to his father, the local laird's head gamekeeper. One day, when they are out together in a storm, his father becomes ill. Geordie carries him home many miles, but his father develops pneumonia and dies. The laird (Alistair Sim) makes Geordie the new gamekeeper. One day, he gets a letter from Samson, who suggests he take up hammer throwing. On his first attempt, he almost hits the laird, who then tries to show him how it is done. However, the laird's own hammer throw almost hits the local minister, who is passing by on his bike. It turns out that the minister is knowledgeable about the sport, and he trains Geordie. At the minister's urging, Geordie reluctantly enters a Highland games. He initially makes two bad throws, but after the unexpected appearance (and encouragement) of Jean, he wins with his final throw. Two members of the Olympics selection committee visit him and invite him to join the British team for the Melbourne Olympic Games in Australia. Geordie is once again reluctant, as he does not particularly care to compete against others, but finally agrees. He takes the train to London, where he finally gets to meet Henry Samson, who has come to see him off when he boards the ship for Australia. Unhappy to be away from home, Geordie finds it difficult to be enthusiastic about training on board ship. However, Helga, a Danish female shot putter, takes a shine to Geordie and talks him out of his mood, though Geordie remains oblivious to the fact that she is attracted to him. When they reach Melbourne, Geordie goes sightseeing with Helga before the Games, buying a highly unusual hat for Jean. An accident occurs nearby, and a man is pinned underneath a car. After several men working together are unable to lift the car, Geordie manages to do it all by himself. His feat is reported in the newspapers, and he becomes very popular. A problem arises: Geordie insists on wearing his late father's Black Watch kilt in the opening ceremony, something he had promised his mother he would do. When he is told that he must wear the same uniform as the rest of the team, he states \"no kilt, no performance!\" Not having received a reply from London, Lord Pauceton, the head of the British team, gives in. After Geordie comes out last in the opening parade of athletes in his kilt, Pauceton receives a telegram emphatically ordering him not to let Geordie wear his kilt, but he ignores it. During the competition, a listless, dispirited Geordie fails with his first two throws. Then, before his third and final throw, he finds inspiration by recalling Jean's encouragement at his first competition. He then makes a world record throw and wins the competition. However, Jean hears on the radio that Helga has rushed up, embracing and kissing Geordie in front of everyone in the stadium, and she is heartbroken. On Geordie's return, there is no one to meet him at the station apart from his mother and a driver for the trap. On the way home, they encounter the laird, who tells him that many think his actions have brought scandal to the glen. Geordie spots Jean fishing and goes to her. They argue, then fall in the stream. After they get out, Geordie shows her the hat he bought for her; she pretends to think it is \"braw\" (fine), and they kiss and make up."

Margo, Liz and Felicia try to drown him in the hot tub. When that fails, Margo shoots him point blank in the chest, killing him. In Purgatory, God (communicating through male and female voices) gives Steve one chance at redemption. He is returned to Earth, alive, and told that he must find a soulmate who truly loves him. If he fails, he will go to Hell. The Devil  convinces God to give Steve a challenge, taking his infamous charm into account, and Steve is transformed into a beautiful woman named Amanda. Amanda goes to Margo, convinces her of her real identity as Steve and persuades her to give her lessons in being a woman. Telling everyone that Steve has run off and that she is his half-sister, Amanda moves into Steve's life, convincing his boss at the advertising agency, Arnold Friedkin, to give her her brother's job, which partly involves getting a plum account with lesbian cosmetics magnate Sheila Faxton. Amanda tries to use her new female body as a weapon in her campaign to get the account and to win a woman's love. Sheila responds, but Amanda balks on following through on the seduction. Margo reminds her that homophobia was one of the traits that made Steve so hateful. Amanda breaks up with Sheila, telling her that the romance was contrived to get her as a client. The agency keeps the account but Sheila is furious at Amanda. When Amanda prays to God for help, the Devil offers her a job with his operation. She refuses and calls all the names in Steve's address book, hoping to find a woman who has something kind to say about him. Instead she discovers just how hated Steve is, and how deeply she as him damaged countless women. In the course of the film, Amanda also begins to understand how women live and resents the way men \u2014 including herself as Steve \u2014 perversely treat them. Steve's best friend, Walter Stone, has been attracted to Amanda from their first meeting, and when despair sends her on a bender, he joins her. They get drunk together, and after Amanda convinces Walter that she is Steve, they have sex. In the morning, Amanda has no memory of the encounter and accuses Walter of raping her while she was passed out \u2014 the same thing Steve himself would have done. Walter is astonished, and insists that Amanda was not only awake but an enthusiastic participant. Amanda recognizes the difference between the man she used to be as Steve and the far better man that Walter is. Meanwhile, Steve's body has been found in the river, and Margo plants her gun in Amanda's sofa, framing her for the crime. Amanda is found unfit for trial. In the mental hospital, she learns that she is pregnant with Walter's child. There are dangerous complications, but she insists on carrying the baby to term. Walter proposes, and Amanda reluctantly accepts: they are married. Months pass and, with Walter beside her, Amanda gives birth to a baby girl. The newborn infant gazes at her mother with love, and Amanda dies, having earned a place in Heaven. Upon arriving in Heaven, Amanda must decide whether to spend eternity as a male or a female angel. She finds the decision difficult, especially after, five years later, she watches as Walter and their daughter bring flowers to her grave. God, in their dual voices, reassures Amanda that she has all eternity to decide."

Although it is Sunday, Joe gets a shoe-repair shop owner to open his store and repair her shoe. Alice asks Joe where he is going, and he says he is on leave but has no definite destination while in New York. He asks to accompany her on her way home atop a double-decker bus, and she points out landmarks along the way, including the Central Park Zoo and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which they both stop and visit. When he asks her whether she is busy that evening, she says that she is. However, when he persists, chasing on foot the bus she is riding down the street, she relents, promising to meet him under the clock at the Astor Hotel. Although her roommate chastises Alice for \"picking up\" a soldier, Alice keeps her date with Joe, arriving late, and the two have dinner. Having missed the last bus home, they accept a ride with a milk man named Al Henry (James Gleason). When Al's truck has a flat tire, he and his passengers visit a lunch room to call for assistance. A drunk strikes Al, blackening his eye, and after the company's road repairman has changed the truck's tire, Alice and Joe spend the night delivering milk to their benefactor's customers. Later, they enjoy the hospitality with Al and his wife, who serves them an early-morning dinner. After they become separated in a subway crowd, they try frantically to find one another, not even knowing each other's last name.  They finally reunite by returning to the place at which they met for the first time, the escalator at Penn Station. Having fallen in love, Joe asks Alice to marry him before his departure the next day, and she consents. However, they must run a maze of red tape which nearly prevents them from doing so. Through their perseverance, they win over bureaucrats upon whom their success or failure depends. However, Alice finds the hurried ceremony \"ugly\" and it is only after they repeat their vows alone in a church pew that she feels truly married. Shortly after the young couple weds, Joe's leave ends and he returns to war."

One friend became prosperous over the next 20 years (owning luxury hotels) and is a promoter, while his younger friend drives a local taxi. Tony manages a small hotel called Garden Of Eden. He grew up poor but spoiled, spending money on expensive suits and a Cadillac, despite always being in debt and refusing to become more responsible. He is also a widowed father of an 11-year-old son named Alvin (nicknamed Ally). In debt, the rent five months in arrears, Tony is given 48 hours by his landlord, Abe Diamond, to raise $5,300 or else lose the hotel. Tony, in desperation calls his older brother Mario, who owns and operates a clothing store and has already loaned Tony money multiple times. Tony lies and says he needs a loan because Ally is ill. Mario and wife Sophie promptly fly from New York City to Miami and discover the truth. In Mario's eyes, Tony is a bum who wastes money on fanciful dreams rather than honest, hard work. He agrees to stake Tony the funds but only for a sensible small business, not dreams of fancy hotels or casinos. Mario also sets him up with Eloise Rogers, a widow and an acquaintance of Sophie, who is considered a more appropriate companion for Tony than his current girlfriend, Shirl. To his surprise, Tony is impressed with Eloise. Ally also takes an immediate liking to her. Mario offends her, however, with prying questions about her late husband's will and finances, causing Tony to confess why they were introduced. Eloise reveals to Tony that, having lost both her husband and son, she appreciates the notion of being with someone who needs her. The old childhood pal, Jerry Marks, now a wealthy promoter, invites Tony to a party. Pretending to be prosperous, Tony explains his scheme to buy land in Florida and open a second Disneyland there. Jerry seems interested in being his partner again. He takes Tony to a greyhound racing track, where Tony uses the $500 he earned from selling his Cadillac to match Jerry's large bet. His dog wins, but he lets it ride in the next race on a dog called Lucky Ally. The obvious desperation in Tony's voice as he roots for the dog to win indicates to Jerry that he is not a man of means. Jerry chastises him afterwards and tries to brush him off by insultingly handing him some cash. When Tony throws the cash handout back in Jerry's face, Tony is punched by one of Jerry's bodyguards. Literally a beaten man, Tony decides it would be best if Ally lived in New York with Mario and Sophie, telling the unconvinced boy that he is unwanted. Tony goes off to the beach by himself, but Ally finds him, and soon Eloise happily joins them. Mario and Sophie decide to take a long, overdue vacation."

Nishigandha \"Nishi\" Dasgupta is the vice-president of SGI, while Vinay Sehgal's brother-in-law Ritesh joins in later as senior vice president. Ashwini, a politician backed by Sehgal, become the Union Finance Minister, which helps the Sehgal Group to enter a lucrative partnership with international food products giants Friscon.

But last-minute politicking by Marwah with Gulabrao leads to the PSU going to the Marwah Group, leaving Sehgal disappointed. However, Nishi charms Marwah Group's CEO Pervez, and is then able to steal critical information from his laptop computer: she finds out that Marwah had been misleading the media that they were planning to manufacture mineral water in the plant, whereas in reality they were planning to manufacture a mint-based soft drink. The Sehgal Group publicly announces that they will be launching their own mint-based soft drink, which they've named \"Just Chill\", pre-empting the Marwah Group's planned launch. Marwah traces the leak to Pervez and fires him. Ten days before the launch of the drink, Sehgal learns that the FDA has found the presence of a large amount of pesticides in the drink. But Sehgal, cold-heartedly, decides to launch the product by bribing the FDA agents. However, CEO Naveen resigns from the SGI. The drink is a great success. However, another of SGI's executive is unhappy that Ritesh is being made the CEO, and he gives Marwah the information that SGI's product contains pesticides. Marwah along with Gulabrao blow up the issue in the media, leading to a raid on the SGI plants and a case on the Sehgals. Sehgal decides that the only solution is for an employee of SGI who is not a member of the Sehgal family to take the blame for the blunder. Nishi is chosen for that role. Ritesh is called on by his sister Chayya Sehgal, where she asks him to convince Nishi to sacrifice for the company. Initially disagreeing, Ritesh agrees to convince Nishi on the insistence of Sehgal as he promises that Nishi would be released by the Enquiry Commission soon. A foreign investor holding major stake in Friscon, urges Ashwini to settle the dispute between the two as this would lead to capital flight and foreign investors will pull back their investments, causing serious havoc in the business market. Ashwini discusses the issue with Gulabrao and both the ministers mediates between Marwah and Sehgal to settle down the issue. Marwah agrees to withdraw all the allegations suited through NGO's and drawing their limitations in Friscon company. However, Gulabrao refuses to release Nishi as it would dent his chances of chief minister-ship as elections roars near. Meanwhile, Ritesh learns that Nishi is pregnant with his baby. Ritesh, angry about it, threatens to expose Sehgal in front of the media if Nishi is not released within 48 hours. The next day he is found dead, having fallen from the terrace of his apartment building. It is assumed to be suicide but some think otherwise. The movie ends with the narrator concluding that Marwah and Sehgal are living happily in their world, whereas there is no place of emotions in corporate world as Nishi is the victim of the corporate tactics. The movie shows Nishi still fighting the case after two years of the incident with her child."

He also suggests that even if Gordon acted without her consent, she provoked him by appearing naked in front of him at the photo shoot where they first met, and by the inherent sensuality of the photographs from which she makes her living. Gordon is ultimately acquitted. Chris leaves her job modeling for the lipstick company and plans to relocate to Colorado with Kathy after her last shoot. Unfortunately, Kathy's school is using the same abandoned building where Chris's shoot is to rehearse a new ballet orchestrated by Gordon. Kathy runs into Gordon and flees when he starts fondling her, but Gordon chases her down and rapes her. Kathy returns to the photo shoot and tells Chris what happened. Gripped in a murderous frenzy, Chris runs outside to her car and grabs a Remington Slide-Action Rifle she had intended to take to Colorado with her. She spots Gordon driving his car in the parking lot, and shoots at it, causing it to crash. As Gordon climbs out of the wreck, Chris keeps shooting him until the rifle is empty. Later, Carla Bondi speaks to a jury, telling them that their acquittal of Gordon earlier resulted in Chris losing faith in the law. The jury ultimately finds Chris not guilty of murder."

        "content": "Lipstick holds an 11% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based upon 9 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes says the film \"is a cheap exploitation film pretending to make a social statement about rape and revenge.\" Lipstick was met with negative critical reception upon release, with much of the criticism focused around the film's treatment of rape, which was perceived as purely exploitative. Roger Ebert called it \"a nasty little item masquerading as a bold statement on the crime of rape. The statement would seem a little bolder if the movie didn't linger in violent and graphic detail over the rape itself, and then handle the vengeance almost as an afterthought.\" The New York Times remarked the film's glamorous photography, but said it was \"anti-intellectual in the ways that B movies always have been.\" Variety reviewed the film with a similar sentiment, declaring: \"Lipstick has pretensions of being an intelligent treatment of the tragedy of female rape. But by the time it's over, the film has shown its true colors as just another cynical violence exploitation.\" Harlan Ellison, writing in March 1977, said: \"Lipstick panders to the basest, vilest, lowest possible common denominators of urban fear and lynch logic. It is the sort of film that, if you see it in a ghetto theater filled with blacks, will scare the bejeezus out of you. The animal fury this film unleashes in an audience is terrifying to behold. It gives exploitation a bad name; and it has less to do with rape, which is the commercial hook on which they\u2019ve hung the salability of this bit of putrescence, than it does with the cynicism of Joseph E. Levine, a man who probably has no trouble sleeping with a troubled conscience.\""

Nilsson as Malotte), 1930 (with Gary Cooper as Glennister and Betty Compson as Malotte; this is the only time that Gary Cooper and John Wayne played the same role in two different films), and 1955 (with Anne Baxter as Malotte, Jeff Chandler as Glennister, and Rory Calhoun as McNamara). Marlene Dietrich, Randolph Scott, and John Wayne also appeared together that same year in a movie called Pittsburgh. Scott was billed above Wayne in both movies, even though Wayne's role was larger and more important in each, because he was under contract to Universal, whereas Wayne was borrowed from Republic. Dietrich and Wayne had also made the earlier film Seven Sinners together in 1940. Bestselling poet Robert W. Service (not credited) plays The Poet, a fictionalized version of himself. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Art Direction (John B. Goodman, Jack Otterson, Russell A. Gausman and Edward Ray Robinson)."

They take a plane somewhere, but are plagued by engine troubles and are forced to land the plane on a lonely deserted island. The six set camp and the next morning, Paul stays at the camp while the others set off to find help. They come upon a large cottage nestled in the woods. After entering the cottage and fooling around a bit, they meet the owners, an elderly married couple going by the simple names of Ma and Pa. The group of friends are welcomed to spend the night. At dinner, Lynn starts smoking and Pa scolds her and demands that she smoke outside. Later, Lynn and Cynthia discover Ma and Pa have a child, Fanny, who looks more like a middle-aged woman but claims she is 12. That night, Ma and Pa throw more strict rules in, such as no cussing and forcing the girls and boys apart to prevent premarital sex. The night passes by and the next morning, Rob goes for a walk and finds Fanny pushing her brother, Woody, on a crudely crafted swing. Rob is invited to swing and agrees, only for Woody to climb to the top and chop the rope, sending Rob down the rocky cliff below to his death. The group finds out about Rob's death and mourn his loss. Later, Lynn and Cynthia are outside and Lynn talks about how this family is a bunch of freaks and Fanny overhears. Cynthia sees this after Lynn leaves and consoles Fanny and reluctantly agrees to play games with Fanny. Fanny shows Cynthia her baby, thought to be just a doll, but it turns out to be the remains of an infant. Cynthia meets another brother, Teddy, and Fanny explains to him that Cynthia is her friend. Meanwhile, Lynn stumbles upon Woody, Teddy, and Fanny playing jump rope in the woods. After Lynn insults them, she is attacked and presumably killed by the three. Cynthia tells Jeff about the mummified infant. Jeff tries to console Cynthia and they kiss. Fanny, who wants Jeff to herself, sees and becomes jealous. She confronts the two and kills Jeff by stabbing him in the eye with a sword on a knight statue. Cynthia explains her fear to Ma, but Ma attacks her saying they are all wicked people. Cynthia flees and Ma finishes Jeff off with her sewing needles. Cynthia runs into the woods, finding Lynn's corpse hanging from a tree and a frightened Terri. Cynthia explains everything to Terri and learns that Paul and the plane are missing. Woody and Teddy find the girls and chase them into the woods. Terri and Cynthia find Fanny, and Terri reveals a gun and holds Fanny at gunpoint, forcing her to help them get off the island. They show Fanny to Ma and Pa and demand their help to get off the island. To save his daughter, Pa tells the girls where a boat is. He leads them to a dinky fisherman's boat, where Paul's corpse is lying, an axe buried in his skull. Cynthia and Terri flee and Teddy and Woody light Paul's body on fire. Night comes and Terri and Cynthia spend the night in a hollow tree. Terri and Cynthia run back to the cottage to find a radio, but are attacked by Woody and Teddy. Teddy pursues Terri into the woods and Fanny toys with Cynthia. Terri is caught by Teddy and has her neck snapped. Teddy rapes Terri's corpse, Woody tattletales and Teddy gets a beating as Cynthia watches in horror. Cynthia eventually breaks down and becomes one of the family, celebrating Fanny's birthday and dressing in a pink gown to match Fanny. However, the flashbacks of her baby drowning get to her; she goes mad, bludgeoning Fanny to death with a metal washtub. She then murders Woody with the sword. She then confronts Ma and stabs her to death with her sewing needles. She finds Teddy and stabs him with a sickle. Pa discovers his family dead and goes outside only to be shot by his own shotgun by Cynthia who has taken revenge and killed the demented family.

Taylor is a thrill-seeking attorney and womanizer, while Harold is a married, level-headed scientist. On a climb, the pair encounter billionaire Phillip Claiborne (Raymond J. Barry), who is accompanied by a team of fellow climbers. Taylor recognizes Dallas (Luca Bercovici) from law school, and the team lets slip that they are testing equipment for a Himalayan expedition.  That night, two members of Claiborne's team ignore Harold's warnings of an impending avalanche and perish when snow careens down the mountain.  Claiborne and the other survivors are rescued, thanks to quick action by Taylor and Harold.  At the interment, Taylor begs Claiborne to take him and Harold on his expedition to K2, the second highest peak in the world. Claiborne ultimately allows the duo to fill the hole in his team. The entire team heads to the Karakoram, in Pakistan, and starts the climb successfully, though Taylor butts heads with Dallas, while Harold feels guilt over leaving his wife for this adventure.  As the ascent continues, the team's Balti porters go on strike (mirroring the real-world experiences of several expeditions in the 1970s), and altitude sickness incapacitates Claiborne.  A four-man team (Taylor, Harold, Dallas, and Japanese climber Takane) continue toward the summit with minimal gear.  They are stopped when Claiborne authorizes (talking via radio) only two men to go for the summit, while two wait in reserve at the high camp.  Dallas chooses Takane as his climbing partner, despite argument from Taylor.  Later, Takane returns to the high camp badly injured and in severe hypothermia, and dies soon afterward. Taylor and Harold ascend, \"searching for Dallas\".  After a grueling journey, the pair celebrate at the \"top of the world\".  Their joy is short-lived, however, as Harold slips on the downclimb, breaks his leg badly, and loses the climbing rope. The pain is unbearable, and he cannot be moved. Over Taylor's objections, Harold sends Taylor to save himself, and Taylor begins a solo descent. By luck, Taylor discovers Dallas' frozen body and scavenges his climbing rope, epinephrine (adrenaline), and an ice axe.  Taylor injects Harold with an epinephrine autoinjector and then begins to lower his friend toward base camp, a few dozen feet at a time.  They descend, until Taylor collapses on a ridge.  Before dark, a Pakistani helicopter comes into view.  The climbers are saved and rejoice."

In 2007, Ninja Gaiden was ported to PlayStation 3 as Ninja Gaiden Sigma, with extra content and graphical improvements; this was released on the portable PlayStation Vita as Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus. Ninja Gaiden was followed by Ninja Gaiden II (2008) and Ninja Gaiden 3 (2012). Ninja Gaiden Sigma was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One as part of the Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection on June 10, 2021."

        "content": "Ninja Gaiden develops its narrative thread through the actions of its player-controlled protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa. Viewed from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical action-adventure fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering or buying items. In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water. The game world is made up of several distinct regions, most of which are connected via the city of Tairon, which functions as a hub. Access to these regions are obtained by fighting enemies, finding keys, or solving puzzles, inspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda video games. Dragon busts scattered throughout the regions provide the means to save player progress, permitting gameplay to be resumed at a later time. Ryu's movements are directed using the console gamepad. The game's control system, which comprises the left thumbstick, two attack buttons, and a block button, was described as fluid and responsive, and Ninja Gaiden was regarded as having one of the deeper combat engines among Xbox games at the time, comparing well to the  action-adventures God of War and Devil May Cry. Eric Williams, the designer of the God of War combat engine, explained that Ninja Gaiden prohibits players from stopping or changing attacks in mid-stroke. In contrast, God of War allows players to do so, and Devil May Cry grants this freedom to certain attacks. Williams said that, compared to those two games, the combat system in Ninja Gaiden was harder to master; however, it lets players fight their computer controlled foes on equal terms. Ninja Gaiden features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield, each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. These include one-handed swords, such as the Dragon Sword and Kitetsu, which grant quick attacks, and a move called the \"Flying Swallow\", which allows Ryu to leap and slash through enemies. In addition these light weapons allow Ryu to smash foes into the ground and perform his signature Izuna Drop\u2014a spinning piledriver. Heavy weapons, such as the Dabilahro and the Unlabored Flawlessness, are slow but cause more damage to opponents. With flails and staves, the player can string together long sequences of attacks. To engage distant foes Ryu can throw shuriken and shoot arrows. In addition to using standard melee techniques, Ryu can employ essences\u2014colored globes of energy that are released on the death of enemies and absorbed into Ryu's body when he comes into proximity with them. Essences have an important role in general gameplay, acting to heal Ryu, restore his magic, or increase his cash. However, in combat the player can cause Ryu to deliberately draw in essences, which can then be used to unleash powerful attacks known as Ultimate Techniques that allow Ryu to damage enemies without taking damage himself. These techniques deal heavy damage and make Ryu immune to injury for a short time. Ninja Gaiden also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ninpo spells. When activated by the player, these make Ryu cast fireballs, ice storms, or bolts of lightning. Functioning in a similar manner to the bombs or grenades of shooter action games, these spells allow Ryu to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself. But, dissatisfied with their programmed visual effects, the game's director Tomonobu Itagaki wanted to deter players from using ninpo. He therefore tweaked the game to award bonus points when players cleared stages without employing magic. For Ryu's defense, the player has two options. First, Ryu can stand still and attempt to block attacks. However, certain enemies can break his guard\u2014either through particularly strong attacks or by grappling him. The second option is to make Ryu dodge, by rolling away from the attack in a maneuver called \"reverse wind\"."

        "content": "Inspired by the 1980s Ninja Gaiden series for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the 2004 version was originally set in a re-imagined game world based on another Team Ninja creation, the Dead or Alive (DOA) series of fighting games. However, interviews with Tomonobu Itagaki indicate that the Xbox games are prequels to the NES series and that both possibly share a single continuity. Ninja Gaiden is set in the game world of the Dead or Alive series. Located mainly in Japan and the fictional Vigoor Empire, the game draws on Heian period structures for its Japanese locales\u2014a ninja fortress and village set in the mountains. In contrast the Vigoor Empire, with its capital city of Tairon, is a blend of architectural types from around the world. European-style buildings display Arabic lettering, and the monastery in Tairon exhibits Gothic influences with a vaulted hall, pointed arches, and large stained glass windows. A hidden underground level features statues with the heads of cats, walls covered with carvings, hieroglyphics, Aztec pyramid and a labyrinth. This mix of styles was the result of Itagaki's refusal to constrain the game's creative process."

He joins an unlicensed bodyguard service led by Uncle Ji (Anthony Wong) to earn money to give to Ah Jo, who wants nothing to do with him.  Nearly nine months later, Tyler meets up with a butcher named Jack Chow (Wu Bai) and his pregnant wife, Ah Hui (Candy Lo), who helps Tyler prevent her father's assassination at his birthday.  Tyler tries to convince Jack to start a bodyguard service with him, but Jack turns him down. A group of mercenaries from South America, known as the Angels, arrive and threaten Jack, who they call Juan, and their second in command Miguel Joventino (Jun Kung) offers him a chance to rejoin them if he kills his own father-in-law.  Instead, Jack assassinates Pablo Santosa the leader of the Angels and evades Uncle Ji's bodyguards, knocking Tyler out in the process, and then steals a case full of cash from under their noses and escapes from the Angels.  Jack drops his wife off at her father's mansion, giving her a key to a train station locker and telling her to go there when their child is born.  Tyler is interrogated by the cops in connection with Jack, who accuse him of being connected to the killer because he saw him up close.  Tyler tells them nothing. Ah Jo tries unsuccessfully to parole Tyler, but Uncle Ji succeeds.  Tyler thanks Ah Jo, and Uncle Ji locks him up in a transportation crate for a night before letting him out and getting Tyler to tell him about Jack.  Uncle Ji gives Tyler more money, which Tyler tries to give to Ah Jo; he finds out that she has just gone into the hospital to give birth.  Tyler heads off after Jack, and breaks into his apartment only to find the Angels and Jack have the place staked out. A running gun battle ensues between Jack and the Angels as Tyler desperately tries to survive in Jack's apartment.  Tyler ends up trapped in the apartment with the gas leaking and only manages to survive the explosion by hiding in the refrigerator, on the advice of Jack.  Jack tricks the Angels into killing one of their own and distracting them long enough so he and Tyler can escape the rest.  Miguel admits defeat and tries to call a truce with Jack, but then calls it off when one of the other Angels spots Jack's wife who arrives on the scene to see her former apartment burning. The Angels take off after Ah Hui, following her to the train station. Tyler steals a taxi with his fake gun, giving his wallet to the driver, who promptly takes it to the cops.  The police, still suspicious of Tyler from earlier, place him at the scene of the gun battle and explosion send a Special Duties Unit team after him to the station.  At the station, Tyler confronts Ah Hui with his fake gun and takes the money Jack stole from the Angels.  Ah Hui goes into labor and one of the Angels shoots a cop, and then an innocent, while trying to shoot Tyler. In the ensuing panic, Tyler drags Ah Hui off to safety and the SDU team arrives to deal with the situation. In response to Tyler's shouts that a pregnant woman has gone into labour, the SDU team send in team members disguised as medics to retrieve Ah Hui. The Angels open fire on them. Jack arrives on the scene just before the SDU team - now including Miguel and other Angels disguised as team members - starts a full invasion with tear gas. In the midst of the gases, Jack, the Angels, and the SDU team hunt one another, with SDU officers silently killed one by one by the disguised Angels, who loot tactical gear from the fallen officers, enabling them to kill even more unsuspecting officers. Tyler escapes with Ah Hui.  In a confrontation on railroad tracks, Jack saves the life of a SDU team lieutenant by killing one of the Angels and surrenders to him. The remaining Angels escape through a tunnel to a stadium full of concert-goers.  Tyler has to hunker down in the tunnels as Ah Hui starts to give birth, and Jack convinces the SDU Lieutenant to let him go after Miguel in the stadium.  Jack confronts Miguel in the catwalks above the concert goers and kills him with a grenade after a brutal hand to hand fight. Meanwhile, Tyler helps Ah Hui successfully give birth before the last of the Angels shows up. A fight ensues, and just as Tyler is about to lose, the last of the Angels gets shot dead by Ah Hui. Jack is given a head-start to escape the police and visits with his wife, and Tyler recovers the money before going off to the hospital to see his child."

        "content": "Production on Time and Tide began in 1999. It was written by director Tsui Hark and Koan Hui. Hui and Hark had collaborated previously on the screenplay for The Blade. Actor Nicholas Tse opted out of appearing in the sequel to Gen-X Cops to be in Time and Tide. Tse announced that it would be his last action film as he desired to focus on his musical career. It was not his last action film as he starred in Wong Jing's My Schoolmate The Barbarian in 2001. After seeing Wu Bai in the Taiwanese film The Personals, Tsui offered Wu the role in Time and Tide. Wu's character was rewritten with him in mind by making him more of a sad loner to match the music he made with his band in China Blue. Cathy Tsui was cast as Ah Jo in the film. She found a scene involving her playing with a dog difficult as she was afraid of them. To make her more comfortable, she was sent to a dog farm where she played with dogs every day to become comfortable around them. The film was radically altered in post-production. The original cut was over three hours long, which Tsui Hark considered to be too slow-paced. He reorganized the entire script including cutting many of Nicholas Tse and Anthony Wong Chau Sang's scenes, leaving Wu Bai's sequences as they were."

Later that day, at the counter in a hectic bookstore, Frank and Molly get their packages mixed up, and on Christmas Day, Molly's husband, Brian, and Frank's wife, Ann, each opens the book that was meant for the other. Three months later, Frank and Molly, who commute into Manhattan from adjacent stops on the Metro-North Hudson Line, run into each other on the morning train. They struggle to place each other, but eventually Frank remembers, and reminds her of the confusion over the books. Later that day, Frank's boss asks him to take a post in Houston. Molly visits her father in hospital. Molly tells Isabelle about Frank; Frank tells Ed about Molly. That evening, Frank waits for Molly at Grand Central Terminal. They talk, and agree to meet on the morning train later that week. Against their better judgement, Frank and Molly grow closer. They see more and more of each other until, one afternoon, Frank takes Molly to Ed's apartment. They begin to make love, but Molly cannot go through with it. They agree that they must stop seeing each other. When Molly returns home that day, Brian gives her the news that her father has died. At the funeral, she has a panic attack. Convalescing, she tells Isabelle that it isn't grief for her father that she is suffering, but the loss of Frank. Meanwhile, Frank agrees to take the job in Houston. He tells Ann about Molly, throwing the future of their marriage into question. On the night he is due to leave, Frank calls Molly at home. Frank asks to see her before he goes, but as Brian stands listening, she ends the call. Unable to resist, she tells Brian she must see Frank one more time, and rushes to her car. Driving fast in the pouring rain, she nearly collides with a train at a crossing, and misses her chance. Meanwhile Frank tries to call her again but her husband answers the phone and says she doesn't want to talk to Frank. Some time later, once more in the run up to Christmas, Frank meets Ed and tells him that he and Ann are now separated. Molly meets Isabelle, and it is clear from their conversation that her marriage to Brian has failed too. Frank makes a stop at the bookstore where he and Molly first met. Molly is there at the same time. They talk but, uncertain how things now stand between them, go their separate ways. Walking away from the store, Frank stops, turns, and runs after her.

        "content": "FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder travel to Browning, Montana to investigate the killing of a Native American man, Joseph Goodensnake, by local rancher Jim Parker. The killing appears to be motivated by a dispute over the ownership of a tract of land, although Parker claims that he fired on a monstrous animal rather than a human. Parker's son, Lyle, bears scars that lend credence to the story. At the scene of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been impossible to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body. The investigation is complicated by the hostility Mulder and Scully face from the Native American population, stemming from their experience with the FBI during the 1973 Wounded Knee incident. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. The local sheriff, Charles Tskany, permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to Lyle's. Mulder tells Scully of a similar incident in the area forty years previously, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case. As the agents watch Goodensnake's body being cremated in a traditional ceremony, Mulder shares with Scully his belief that the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. Jim Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious a few hundred yards away. Ish, one of the elder men of the reservation, explains to Mulder the legend of the manitou, a creature which can possess and transform a man and can pass to a new host, through a bite, or upon the death of the original host. Ish believes he had seen the creature in his youth, but was too frightened to confront it. He says it happens every eight years to someone in the region, and that it has been that long since the last sighting of a possible manitou. Mulder calls the medical examiner, who tells him that Scully has taken Lyle back to the ranch, and Jim's blood type was found in Lyle's stomach. Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature, which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, which is shot by Tskany as it lunges to attack them. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Lyle\u2019s body, believing they were attacked by a captive mountain lion; Tskany replies that the lion is still in its cage. As the agents leave, they learn that Gwen has left town, while Ish cryptically warns Mulder, \"FBI... See you in about... eight years\". As Mulder and Scully drive away, a wolf is heard howling in the forest."

The episode made mention of the first X-File case to have been opened, apparently initiated by J. Edgar Hoover in 1946; whilst it also references the events of the earlier first season episode \"Beyond the Sea\", as Scully is seen discussing her father's death. \"Shapes\" marked the first time an episode of The X-Files had made use of Native American themes and folklore.

Guest star Michael Horse, who plays Sheriff Charles Tskany, is the third guest star of the series to have previously appeared alongside David Duchovny in Twin Peaks, after fellow alumni Claire Stansfield, who played the Jersey Devil in the episode of the same name, and Don Davis who had portrayed Agent Scully's father William in the earlier episode \"Beyond the Sea\". Davis would reappear in the second season's \"One Breath\", while other Twin Peaks actors would appear in later episodes of the series\u2014Michael J. Anderson in the second season's \"Humbug\", Kenneth Welsh in the third season's \"Revelations\" and Richard Beymer in \"Sanguinarium\" from the fourth season. Much of the episode was filmed in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows, British Columbia, on a site named Bordertown\u2014a \"classic western\" town that had been built specifically for film sets, located just a \"ten-minute drive\" from first assistant director Tom Braidwood's home. The area was chosen as it provided locations for the exterior shots of the reservation, plus all of the interior areas that were needed for the episode. Despite covering the area in gravel, heavy rains left the ground sodden and muddy enough to bog down equipment and vehicles. Similar weather conditions would hinder the filming of the next episode, \"Darkness Falls\". The funeral pyre scene was lit mostly using the natural light of the bonfire used; whilst the extras who sang and prayed were cast by director David Nutter after a visit to a weekly meeting of Native Americans in Vancouver, who felt that casting non-professionals would lend the scene more authenticity."

        "content": "\"Blood\" is the third episode of the second season of the science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network on September 30, 1994. The teleplay was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong from a story by Darin Morgan and was directed by David Nutter. The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \"Blood\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.8, being watched by 8.7 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly positive reviews. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of killings in Franklin, Pennsylvania.  All the suspects appear compelled to murder after seeing violent messages on electronic devices. \"Blood\" was inspired by writer Glen Morgan's own hematophobia as well as controversy over malathion spraying in Southern California. The episode marked the second appearance of the Lone Gunmen in the series, as well as a guest appearance by pornographic actress Ashlyn Gere."

        "content": "In Franklin, Pennsylvania, postal worker Edward Funsch (William Sanderson) is informed that he will be laid off at the end of the week. Afterwards, Funsch sees the words \"Kill 'Em All\" on his machine's digital display. At Franklin's civic center, a middle-aged man in a crowded elevator sees \"No Air\" displayed on the elevator's LED display, and is the only one who can see the message. Sweating and obviously claustrophobic, he again glances at the LED display. This time it flashes the words \"Can't Breathe\" and then \"Kill 'Em All.\" Agent Fox Mulder arrives at the civic center after what looks like a massacre; bodies lie on the sidewalk and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips. Later on, Funsch tries to make a withdrawal from an ATM, but is greeted with the words \"Take His Gun\" and \"Kill 'Em All\" on the screen. He frustratedly beats the screen before running away, escaping from a confused security guard. At the FBI Academy, Dana Scully reads Mulder's initial report. The only connection between the murders that he can see is that the suspects all destroyed an electronic device during the killings. Meanwhile, Bonnie McRoberts, another Franklin resident, drops by a repair shop to pick up her car, where a message on an engine diagnostic display warns her that the mechanic is going to rape her. She impulsively kills him with an oil can spout. When Mulder and Spencer question her the next morning, her kitchen microwave instructs her to kill them. When she grabs a knife and attacks Mulder, she is shot and killed by Spencer. Scully performs an autopsy on McRoberts' body and discovers signs of phobia including high levels of adrenaline and the same substance found on the elevator killer. She hypothesizes that the substance, when combined with other neurochemicals, produces an LSD-like reaction. While Mulder and Scully build a case, Funsch becomes more psychotic, continuing to see violent messages on electronic gadgets. Blood is associated in some way with each incident; a volunteer asks Ed to donate blood at a department store and seconds later he sees several violent images - including  the Waco siege burning, the LAPD beating of Rodney King and subsequent 1992 Los Angeles riots, the O. J. Simpson police chase, and cult leader Charles Manson - flash across a sales display of TV sets, followed by a message to get a gun from the sporting goods department. Late at night, while investigating an orchard, Mulder is sprayed by a crop-dusting helicopter and ends up in the hospital. There, Mulder sees the message \"Do It Now\" on a TV and realizes that when people are exposed to the pesticide, which contains a chemical called LSDM designed to provoke fear in insects, they see these subliminal messages, and their phobias are exacerbated enough to cause them to kill. Eventually, after being confronted, the city councilman agrees to stop the spraying and blood test the community under the guise of a cholesterol study. Mulder and Scully, reading that Funsch has not been tested yet, arrive at his house to find it strewn with smashed electronic devices. Mulder deduces that blood is Ed's phobia and that he has seen the subliminal messages, and an empty rifle case signals that Funsch is going to act on his paranoia. Funsch positions himself at the top of a clock tower overlooking a blood drive and begins shooting randomly. Mulder climbs up to Funsch and overpowers him; Funsch is taken away on a stretcher. Mulder makes a call to Scully and sees the message \"All done. Bye Bye\" on his cell phone display. Scully calls out to Mulder but he is speechless."

        "content": "The basic premise for \"Blood\" evolved from three topics: co-writer Glen Morgan's own hematophobia, the controversy over malathion spraying in Southern California, and a somewhat vague idea that Morgan and his writing partner James Wong had about focusing on postal workers. After series creator Chris Carter expressed his desire to feature a story revolving around digital readouts, Morgan and Wong decided to combine their disparate influences with the digital readout idea, eventually producing a script that turned \"new technolog[ies]\" (e.g. fax machines and cellular phones\") into something \"scary.\" Morgan and Wong also based the episode's climax on the 1966 University of Texas tower shooting. Of note, this scene was only partially filmed at the University of British Columbia because firearms were not allowed on location at the actual university. This necessitated that a replica of its clock tower's interior be constructed for use in several key scenes. This episode marks the first time that Darin Morgan, Glen's brother, helped with an X-Files script. Darin had been asked to help flesh out the episode's story, and he would later write the second season episode \"Humbug\". The episode features the second appearance of The Lone Gunmen, a trio of conspiracy theorists consisting of John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) and Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood). The characters first appeared in the first season episode \"E.B.E.\" to make Mulder appear more credible. The three were initially slated to appear in only one episode, but they were brought back as recurring characters starting with \"Blood\" due to their popularity with fans of the show online. The episode also guest stars pornographic actress Ashlyn Gere, who plays Bonnie McRoberts, the woman driven to attack Mulder after seeing a subliminal message on her microwave. Glen Morgan joked that The X-Files was so cutting edge that they used an adult film star who was still working in the industry\u2014an allusion to and jab at the NYPD Blue episode \"Tempest in a C-Cup\", which guest starred retired adult film actress Ginger Lynn."

He believes that he is a \"shoo-in\" for manager of a Donaldson's that is scheduled for construction just a few blocks away from his home. Every day, Doug deals with the pressures of being the assistant manager. Among his ordeals are an unruly gang of teenagers loitering around the parking lot, the overwhelming amount of negative comments on the customer survey cards he collects (nearly all of which are caused by the gang's antics), a foreigner who constantly slaps him over a box of Teddy Grahams, and the rumors about him being a former Junior Olympics medalist in gymnastics. Then one day, Richard Wehlner and his family move in from Quebec, and he becomes assistant manager alongside Doug. Since Richard's arrival, it appears that he has replaced Doug as front-runner for the job. But it soon becomes clear that Richard has disadvantages of his own, such as a past substance abuse problem and a tendency to make inappropriate remarks. In one incident, both men are challenged by the board of directors over a sign posted on the deli section window, citing the deli clerk as Employee of the Month for \"cutting the cheese\". Richard admits being manager on duty when the sign was discovered, and explains that he had not realized that the phrase is derogatory to the American public (claiming that \"cracking the cheese\" is what Canadians say). The competition between Doug and Richard causes strain on their respective marriages. Doug is under financial pressure to get the job because he has begun to buy a house that he cannot afford if he is not promoted while his wife Jen ponders on going to night school. Meanwhile, Richard's wife Laurie and daughter leave him to temporarily move to her parents' home in Scotland when she sees he is losing control and reverting to his previous behavioral problems. One day, while helping a customer in the parking lot, Doug is hit on the back of the head by a bottle of Yoo-hoo thrown by one of the gang members. In retaliation, he confronts the gang and sprays one of them with mace. Further worsening the situation is an incident in the break room, where a furious Doug throws some frozen Tater Tots toward the trash can and accidentally hits Richard's hand with one; Richard fakes an injury by wearing a wrist brace at work. Days later, Doug gives an apology speech at a local community explaining his actions during the incident and wins the respect of the community, assuring them that a beautiful day should not be spoiled by a few \"bad apples\". After the meeting, the board of directors, the assistant managers and the community leaders have a brief meeting, wherein Richard inadvertently refers to the gang as \"black apples\", infuriating the head community leader. After several attempts to eliminate each other as competitors, both Doug and Richard, along with another prospect, are summoned by the board of directors for a final interview. Richard's hopes are shattered when it is revealed that a drug test is required, as he has recently smoked marijuana. Shortly after the interview, Doug is given a call by Mitch and notified that he has landed the job, as Richard failed his drug test and the other candidate is too junior-grade for the position. He celebrates by doing cartwheels and backflips while crossing the street \u2013 finally confirming the earlier rumor about himself. Meanwhile, after reuniting with his wife, Richard and his family return to Quebec to his old grocery store, where he is reported to have become the store manager after singlehandedly stopping an accidental fire (which is rumored to have been started by Richard himself)."

        "content": "Writer Dan O'Bannon, wanting to write a science-fiction action film, collaborated with screenwriter Ronald Shusett on a script, initially titled Star Beast, but eventually changed to Alien. Brandywine Productions, a company which had a distribution deal with 20th Century Fox, bought the script. The writers expected it to be a low-budget film, but the success of Star Wars inclined Fox to invest millions. In the original script, the ship had an all-male crew, though it noted that all parts were gender-interchangeable. The Ripley character was initially to be played by Tom Skerritt, but when Fox president Alan Ladd Jr. and the producers at Brandywine heard rumors of Fox working on other titles with strong female leads, it was decided to cast a female as Ripley and Skerritt became Captain Dallas. Swiss painter and sculptor H. R. Giger designed the alien creature's adult form and the derelict ship, while French artist M\u0153bius created the look of the spacesuits and Ron Cobb provided most of the industrial design for the sets. While Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, was successful, Fox did not consider a sequel until 1983, when James Cameron expressed his interest to producer David Giler in continuing the Alien story. After Cameron's The Terminator became a box office hit, Cameron and partner Gale Anne Hurd were given approval to direct and produce the sequel to Alien, scheduled for a 1986 release. Cameron wrote the screenplay for Aliens from a story he developed with Giler and Walter Hill. Following the second film, Weaver was not interested in returning to the series, so Giler and Hill commissioned a sequel without the Ripley character. Fox's president Joe Roth opposed Ripley's removal, and Weaver was offered a $5 million salary and a producer credit to make Alien 3. Giler, Hill and Larry Ferguson wrote the screenplay, based on a story from an earlier script by Vincent Ward, intended to bring closure to the Alien franchise by killing off Ripley, the principal character. Alien 3 faced a mired production, with extensive script difficulties, trouble securing a director, production beginning prior to the completion of a final script, as well as profuse studio interference. While fans and critics initially did not receive Alien 3 well, the film was a worldwide success and piqued Fox's interest in continuing the franchise. In 1996, production on the fourth Alien film, Alien Resurrection, began. Ripley was not in the script's first draft, and Weaver was not interested in reprising the role. She joined the project after being offered an $11 million salary and more creative control, including director approval. The script, set 200 years after Alien 3, resurrected the Ripley character via human cloning. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, experienced an extended production, and screenwriter Joss Whedon later recounted that it had done \"everything wrong\" with his script. The film was released in 1997 to mixed reviews and modest box office returns, and is unsucceeded."

The film stars Skeet Ulrich as Mitnick and Russell Wong as Shimomura, with Angela Featherstone, Donal Logue, Christopher McDonald, Master P, and Tom Berenger. Upon release, the film and its source material came under controversy due to inaccuracies and falsehoods alleged by Mitnick against Shimomura and the screenwriters. The film's producers faced a lawsuit from author Jonathan Littman, who alleged that portions of the film's screenplay were taken from his book The Fugitive Game: Online with Kevin Mitnick. As such, the film was not released in the United States until September 24, 2004, where it was released direct-to-video by Dimension Films."

She receives a recording from her fianc\u00e9 Jim, who has been sent as part of a small production crew to Iceland to investigate a Monster that lives there. Determined to find her fianc\u00e9, Beatrice convinces her boss to send her to Iceland, but her plane crashes. She is the only survivor and, in order to walk again, undergoes an extremely painful, radical surgery. As she recovers, she befriends Dr. Anna (Julie Christie), who helps her travel to the remote village where the monster lives. After cajoling Beatrice into drinking herself into unconsciousness, the villagers strip her and leave her as an offering to the Monster himself (Robert John Burke), a foul-mouthed, alcoholic beast old enough to remember human ancestors crawling from the seas. Beatrice shows him no real fear, although the Monster tells her he has killed her friends and might kill her, too. He tells her that he wants to die, but is indestructible. In an effort to force Beatrice to try to kill him, he proves that he killed Jim and his crew. She shoots him twice and he reacts in obvious pain, but heals almost instantly. He tells her of a mad scientist, Dr. Artaud (Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur, presumably named for Antonin Artaud), who had discovered a way to kill him, but Dr. Artaud had been \"taken away in a strait jacket.\" Beatrice offers to help him find Dr. Artaud if the Monster comes with her to New York and promises not to kill anyone while he is there. In New York the Monster becomes a celebrity, with the Boss staging a media frenzy as they search for Dr. Artaud. They find that he is working for the government. While Beatrice revels in the attention, the Monster remains miserable and drunk. The Boss makes a deal with a government scientist to study the Monster and he's rushed away by army guards who  mislead him into believing he is going to see Dr. Artaud. Instead, he is subjected to torturous experiments as the scientists try to discover the key to his indestructibility, one of them noting that he can't seem to tolerate new information. One of those experiments involves the Monster being ridiculed and beaten on the street to study his behavior. The Monster holds true to his promise to Beatrice and does not kill anyone. Meanwhile, Beatrice meets Dr. Artaud by chance. With Margaret (Annika Peterson), a remorseful former coworker of Beatrice's, they hatch a plan to escape back to Iceland with the Monster. They make their escape, but are pursued by the government, who fears the Monster and Artaud might fall into the wrong hands. Artaud builds a machine that will kill the Monster. Beatrice bids the Monster a tearful farewell, and kisses him goodbye. As the machine starts, the army storms their hideout. As the lights flicker on and off and the machine moves the Monster into place (in a process mirroring Beatrice's surgery), the Monster and Beatrice face each other one last time. Her face flickers in his vision for several minutes before the screen blackens."

It was shot in Iceland and New York City during September and October 2000. It was the first Hartley production for a major company, MGM/United Artists, and Francis Ford Coppola was one of the executive producers. The film was ill-received at the Cannes Film Festival, after which the studio demanded the movie be recut. Hartley refused, and Coppola supported him. These events, and the September 11 attacks, complicated the relation with the studio. The release, in early 2002, was a low-key affair; after two weeks, only three screens showed the film. It went to home video within months. In 2012, the film's screenplay was made available on Hal Hartley's website in a book that also included the screenplays for The Book of Life and The Girl From Monday."

Streets and areas where the actual events of Bloody Sunday happened were used by the production team, such as William Street, Creggan, Craigavon Bridge and Harvey Street, where Father Edward Daly was, in a well-known scene, filmed waving a blood stained handkerchief escorting men carrying one of the victims, Jackie Duddy.

None of the other Voyager crew members are visible, and it appears Voyager has abandoned its attempts to return to the Alpha Quadrant and Earth. After being shown to her work station, Janeway meets a man named Jaffen, who intervenes when Janeway inadvertently misconfigures her console and sets off an alarm. They soon run afoul of Annika Hansen (Seven of Nine), the plant's stern new \"efficiency monitor\". Tuvok, a fellow employee, approaches Janeway in apparent confusion, though neither Janeway, Tuvok, or Seven of Nine recognize one another. Tuvok claims that they do not belong there, which attracts the attention of a doctor and mystifies Janeway and Jaffen. A doctor diagnoses Tuvok with \"dysphoria syndrome\" and begins treatment. Tuvok shows signs that he has recalled his time on Voyager and attempts several more times to contact the others. Tom Paris, who was employed at the plant with Janeway and Tuvok, is fired despite there being a labor shortage. He takes a job at a bar, and befriends B'Elanna Torres, a pregnant woman who also works at the energy plant. Meanwhile, Chakotay, Neelix, and Harry Kim return to Voyager from a short mission away to find the ship empty other than the Emergency Command Hologram (the Doctor), who is in command and attempting to make repairs on the damaged ship, while contending with a damaged and uncooperative computer system. The ECH explains that the ship was damaged by a floating mine, which was a ruse allowing unknown parties to abduct the crew. Chakotay has himself surgically altered to resemble the planet's native race, and beams down to the planet, masquerading as \"Amal Kotay.\" After following Torres for several minutes, he assists Neelix in abducting and transporting her to Voyager (where the Doctor reverses the mental conditioning).

Examining the files of the plant's newest \"employees,\" she discovers they are all Voyager officers and crew, and begins to launch a deeper investigation. Meanwhile, Chakotay, Kim and the Doctor discover the planet's own government is unaware of the kidnappings.

Nathu declines saying he has never killed a pig before and doesn't have the necessary skill for it, offering instead to tan the hide if required provided the people from the piggery kill it. Thekedar insists and gives Nathu 5 rupees and leaves the shop saying by morning the jamadar will come to take the carcass. Early next morning Bakshiji (A.K. Hangal) and a few members of the political party go to a Muslim mohalla to clean drains as propaganda, singing patriotic songs. They're received at the mohalla warmly and are joined in by the residents in cleaning the drains. Later they are confronted by an old Muslim and asked to leave for their own good. Soon stones fly at the party members from neighboring houses and they flee the scene. Party members then discover that someone has thrown a pig carcass at the steps of a mosque. Fearing unrest in the community, Bakshiji and Hayat Baksh (Manohar Singh), the spokesman of the Muslim League, visit the Deputy Commissioner Richard (Barry John) at his house and urge him to take preemptive measures to bring the situation under control. Richard declines the suggestions of Bakshiji and Hayat Baksh to deploy police or impose a curfew and instead tells the party members to urge their respective communities to maintain peace and order. Nathu having seen the pig carcass at the mosque and having witnessed slight unrest in the town, wonders whether it was the same pig he had killed last night. While returning home in the evening he sees the thekedar in the street. Nathu tries to approach him but the thekedar rushes off hurriedly. Now sure that it was the same pig, Nathu feels terribly guilty and goes home and confesses it all to his pregnant wife Kammo (Deepa Sahi). Outside at a distance they see burning houses and Nathu blames himself for the erupting communal violence. Sensing danger, Nathu decides to leave the city with his wife and mother. They start off on foot, Nathu carrying his old crippled mother on his back. During the travel Nathu's mother dies and has to be burned in the forest without proper funeral rites which further devastates the conscience-stricken Nathu who in his naivety holds himself responsible for the holocaust. In a nearby village Harnam Singh (Bhisham Sahni) and his wife Banto (Dina Pathak) are the only Sikh family. They too are planning to go to their daughter Jasbir's (Uttara Baokar) house in a Sikh village. They travel on foot all night and the next morning reach a village and knock a door seeking shelter. The house belongs to a Muslim, Ehsan Ali (Iftekhar), who has been a friend of Harnam Singh since long. Harnam Singh and Banto hide at the house during the day, but at night are discovered by Ehsan's son and are asked to leave immediately. On their way the next morning they meet Nathu and his wife in the forest and they all go together to a gurudwara where Jasbir and several other Sikhs have taken shelter. At the gurudwara Teja Singh (Amrish Puri), the leader of the Sikh council, informs the Sikhs that Muslims are continually collecting arms and sikhs should do the same. Later that night a junior granthi comes to the gurudwara and informs Teja Singh that the Muslims know that the Sikhs are out numbered and not sufficiently armed, so they\u2019re demanding 2 lakh rupees for truce. Teja Singh and the Sikh council deem the amount too much and send the granthi and Nathu to negotiate with the Muslims. Teja Singh and the council members watch from the terrace of the gurudwara as Nathu and the granthi are approached by the Muslim mob, surrounded and attacked. Sikhs enraged by this take up arms and go out to fight shouting Sikh slogans. Back at the gurudwara Jasbir leads the Sikh women to a collective suicide by jumping into a well, some with their children in their arms. Richard is later shown addressing prominent figures of the city where he informs the gathering about the relief measures taken by the government and proposes the leaders to form an Aman Committee to send out a message of peace. Bakshiji and Hayat Baksh are made vice presidents of Aman Committee. At the conclusion of the meeting the thekedar is seen shouting communal harmony slogans. Harnam Singh, Banto, and Kammo are at the refugee camp. Harnam Singh requests a government employee to help find Nathu who hasn't been seen since he went with the junior granthi for negotiating with the Muslims. The employee suggests they inquire at the hospital tent where he might've been admitted had he been found in the city. Kammo looks through the dead bodies lying in a row on the ground and identifying Nathu's dead body among them, she collapses, crying. She goes into labor immediately and is taken into the hospital tent by nurses. Harnam Singh and Banto sitting outside the tent hear the newborn's cries from inside the tent mixed with slogans of \"Allahu Akbar\" and \"Har Har Mahadev\" coming from a distance."

        "title": "Circuit (film)_Plot",
        "content": "The film opens with John (Jonathan Wade Drahos) regaining consciousness in a restroom stall at \"The Red Party.\" He stares at himself in the mirror and flashes back to when he was a small-town cop from Illinois who moved to Los Angeles, hoping to find a more welcoming environment. He temporarily moves in with his cousin Tad (Daniel Kucan), who is living with his suddenly ex-boyfriend Gill (Brian Lane Green) and Tad's new boyfriend Julian (Darryl Stephens). Tad is a filmmaker, shooting a documentary on circuit parties and Julian DJs at the parties. Gill takes John to a party in the Hollywood hills, where he meets Hector (Andre Khabbazi), a hustler who is battling mounting insecurities over his looks and age as he is about to turn 30. John and Hector forge a friendship and Hector introduces John to the world of circuit parties and illicit drugs. One of Tad's subjects is Bobby (Paul Lekakis), an exotic dancer and model who performs at circuit parties (and with whom coincidentally John tricked at a party). Bobby is HIV-positive but asymptomatic. Tad records Bobby's performance at a club. Also performing at the club, as a comedian, is Nina (Kiersten Warren), who coincidentally is a friend of John's. She is living out of her car so John invites her and her cat to stay with him in his new trailer. Tad shows his footage of Bobby to Gino (William Katt), who is an investor, to secure the funding to finish the film. Gino is involved in a number of business ventures, including running circuit parties with his wife Louise (Nancy Allen), distributing drugs and buying viatical settlements, including Bobby's. Gino offers Tad half the money he needs. After viewing the footage Gino angrily confronts Bobby, who remarks that Gino gambled by buying his insurance policy and lost. John follows Hector deeper into circuit scene, using a variety of drugs including Special K, GHB, cocaine, crystal meth and, suffering from body dysmorphia despite being in terrific physical shape, anabolic steroids. Gill has grown tired of Tad and Julian living with him and gives them a deadline for moving out. Initially he agrees to let them stay until after the White Party so Julian can earn rent money and Tad can finish his film but then decides he wants them out sooner. Desperate, Tad returns to Gino for more financing. Gino refuses. Louise, growing more disgusted with Gino, later secretly gives Tad the money. Gino becomes obsessed with Bobby and plans to kill him. He offers to pay Hector to sleep with Bobby and slip Bobby poisoned drugs. John begins working security for Gino's parties (which is largely an excuse for his own partying). One such party is The Red Party, where John runs into a drag queen who remembers him from his small town days. This reminder of his past nearly sends John over the edge, leading to the drug binge which lands him on the stall floor. Gill and Nina realize John is in trouble but are not able to help him. John goes so far as to prostitute himself, joining Hector for a scene in which they have sex while a client watches. John, disgusted with himself, argues with Hector and refuses to take his cut of the fee. Eventually Nina moves out after John, in a drug-induced rage, attacks her cat. John tries to seduce Gill, who refuses him because of his heavy partying and drug abuse. John reduces his partying and drug use and goes to Gill for a job with his landscaping business. He and Gill also pursue a romantic relationship, but John, having stopped his steroid use, can't perform sexually because his body feels \"soft.\" He returns to Hector for more \"juice.\" It is the weekend of the annual Palm Springs White Party. Gino has provided Hector, who has become more terrified about losing his youth and looks, with the poisoned drugs. Tad is going to the party to record the last footage he needs to complete his documentary, including Bobby's farewell performance. Julian is DJing. John is going to supervise security. He and Hector travel by limousine and they reconcile. After giving John his headphones to listen to a song, Hector confesses that he loves him. Gino and Louise are also at the party and amidst the chaos Louise leaves him. After Bobby's farewell performance, Hector goes to his room and they have sex for most of the night. When they're spent, Bobby says to Hector, \"you saved my life tonight.\" Hector replies, \"More than you'll ever know\" and ingests the poisoned drugs. He dies, on his 30th birthday. The next morning, Bobby discovers that Hector is dead. John, on his way to find Hector, runs into Gino outside the room, who says how sorry he is about Bobby's death, but trails off when Bobby walks out of the room. John looks in and sees Hector's body. He realizes Gino is involved and starts to attacks him, then, shattered by grief, runs off weeping. Six months later, John and Gill (still dating), Nina, Tad, Bobby, Louise, and others gather for the premiere of Tad's documentary."

        "content": "Out of the Blue is a 2006 New Zealand crime drama film directed by Robert Sarkies and starring Karl Urban. The film premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival in Canada and was released in New Zealand on 12 October 2006 to minor controversy. The film has since grossed well over $1 million at the New Zealand box-office taking it into the top ten highest grossing local films. The film is based on the Aramoana massacre that occurred over a period of two days in mid November 1990 in a small seaside settlement in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand. The small coastal community of Aramoana (M\u0101ori for \"pathway to the sea\") lies on the edge of the Pacific Ocean at the base of a narrow sandy spit which juts into the mouth of Otago Harbour, 27 kilometres northeast of the city of Dunedin. The settlement is normally a peaceful, idyllic locale, but in 1990 the community was turned upside down as a result of the country's worst massacre prior to the Christchurch mosque shootings. Resident David Gray, an unemployed gun enthusiast, went on a shooting spree, killing 13 people before being killed by police."

        "content": "Aramoana, Tuesday 13 November 1990. David Gray, an unemployed man in his 30s who lives in his parent's small holiday home, cycles into town where he has an argument with staff at a bank over a minor issue. Unstable and angry, he returns home where he has a cache of fire-arms, including a semi-automatic rifle. Late in the afternoon, he notices children from a neighbouring house have wandered onto his yard and he angrily abuses them, sparking a heated verbal exchange with their father, Garry Holden. Gray goes inside his house and then quickly re-emerges armed with the rifle, shooting Holden dead. Holden's two young daughters, Chiquita and Jasmine, and his girlfriend Julie-Anne's adopted daughter Rewa, witness the murder and flee inside Holden's house, attempting to hide. Gray enters and soon locates them. Chiquita is then seen fleeing, having been wounded, trying to get help for Jasmine and Rewa (whose deaths occur off-screen). She reaches Julie-Anne and they both get into her van and drive towards the scene, trying to rescue the other girls, only to find Holden's house has been set on fire. Julie-Anne is then forced to drive to safety as Gray fires at her vehicle. Nearby residents hear the shooting and see the smoke, not yet comprehending what is happening. Gray enters a nearby house and shoots dead both elderly male occupants (their deaths occur off-screen). Elderly widow Eva Dickson, who recently has had hip surgery, ventures out with her walking frame to see what is happening and she is joined by a neighbour Chris Cole. Earlier, Dickson's middle-aged son James had left the house, looking for his dog. An unseen Gray opens fire, hitting Cole and narrowly missing Dickson. Having collapsed and unable to stand up again, Dickson crawls inside her house to ring the police and then goes back to Cole, lying badly wounded but still conscious, to tell him that help is coming (Cole later succumbs to his injuries). A utility with six people on board, including three children, drives up from the nearby beach, stopping near the burning house. Gray emerges and opens fire. The subsequent shootings are not shown, only the noise and the look of horror on the face of a nearby witness. It is now getting dark and the Holden house is engulfed in flames. The first police to arrive are Sgt Stewart Guthrie, Constable Nick Harvey and Detective Paul Knox. They arrive at Gray's and Holden's houses, seeing bodies in and around the utility, including a woman on the ground who is badly wounded and calling for help. The police attempt to surround Gray's house but the gunman surprises Guthrie from behind, shooting him dead. Harvey, armed with a rifle, briefly has Gray in his sights but hesitates, missing his chance. Knox reaches the utility, discovering the woman is now dead but one of the vehicle's other occupants still alive- 3-year-old Stacey Percy, who has been wounded in the abdomen but is still conscious. Knox and Harvey enter Gray's house but find it empty. They get into a car, Harvey nursing Stacey, trying to keep her conscious and Knox holding the bodies of the other two children from the utility, and drive to where a police cordon is being established, handing Stacey over to paramedics. Harvey is physically ill as he reacts to the fear and trauma. Eva Dickson stays in her kitchen, keeping in touch with police by phone. Her dog comes back, stained with the blood of her son James (whose death has occurred off-screen). The police seal off the town, residents spending a fearful night in their homes with the gunman still at large. Gray enters a crib and, finding it deserted, spends the night there. The next day, police have arrived en masse and are combing the town, searching for Gray. Armed Offenders Squad (AOS) officers locate the crib and surround the small house. After a brief exchange of gunfire, the officers throw tear-gas canisters into the house. Gray abruptly emerges, screaming obscenities and firing wildly from the hip. The waiting officers open fire and hit Gray several times, the gunman collapsing. With difficulty, the AOS men restrain him and then wait nearby as Gray dies of his wounds. A postscript follows, consisting of a montage of scenes, including the full squad of AOS officers escorting Eva Dickson from her home as a mark of respect for her bravery, Chiquita Holden and Stacey Percy in hospital, both recovering from their wounds, the deliberate torching of Gray's house that occurred several days after the massacre and a list of names of the 13 people who died on 13 November."

        "content": "The film has received positive reviews but had a controversy during production. It faced a lot of opposition from the town, and as a result no filming was done in Aramoana. Some members of the community were against the movie being filmed, but they would get to see the movie first before it was released to the public, and it would not be called 'Aramoana.' Most of the filming was shot in Long Beach, a settlement six kilometres from Aramoana. The Office of Film and Literature Classification has classified the film Out of the Blue as R15 (restricted to viewers under 15 years of age) with the descriptive note \"violence and content that may disturb\".  The film was restricted because the murders it depicts are likely to cause younger viewers distress and threaten their sense of personal safety.  \"Out of the Blue deals with recent events involving real people.  For that reason we consulted with the families of victims and the Aramoana community.  We were impressed by the articulate and heartfelt comments they made at our meetings\" said Chief Censor Bill Hastings. The film deals with violence in a realistic but restrained way.  The effect the film has on its audience is likely to depend on the circumstances of the viewer.  Mr Hastings said \"for some of those closely involved in the events it portrays the film may be upsetting and traumatic.  Other people may view it as a sensitive portrayal of the responses of ordinary people to horrific events.\" One of the AOS officers who located and shot Gray, Mike Kyne, took exception to the way they were portrayed in the film as standing to one side and smoking cigarettes whilst a hand-cuffed Gray lay on the ground, dying of his injuries. Kyne said, 'That's bullshit. Poetic licence.' In reality, none of the AOS officers had smoked at the scene. Kyne pointed out that to have done so would have been highly unprofessional. After restraining Gray, they had called an ambulance. (Unlike the scene in the film, Gray did not die outside the crib but later in the ambulance en route to hospital.) Also, in the exchange of gunfire prior to Gray's capture, one of the AOS members was shot in the buttocks, which is not seen in the film."

He is given the chance and goes about the uphill task of making the company viable again. Gradually, Shekhar heals the gaping wound left in the Shah family by Amar's death and they come to accept him as one of the family while he falls in love with Pia. What they don't know \u2013 except for Bosco, Shekhar's friend in Canada \u2013 is that it was Shekhar's jeep that accidentally had hit Amar after he swerved to avoid hitting an innocent girl who had walked into the road, causing his death.

Cl\u00e9ment takes the part in order to see more of Amanda and plays along with the mistaken identity, going by the name Alexander Dumas.

        "content": "In 1955,  Monroe had entered into a new contract with 20th Century Fox, requiring her to star in four films within the next seven years. By 1959, she had completed only one: Bus Stop, released in 1956. While Monroe shot Some Like It Hot in 1958 (for United Artists) her then-husband, playwright Arthur Miller, completed the screenplay for The Misfits (1961), which they had intended to be Monroe's next film. Some Like It Hot was released in March 1959 and became an enormous success. Critics praised the film and Monroe's performance. Hoping to capitalize on this, 20th Century Fox insisted that Monroe fulfill her contract. The Misfits was put on hold and Monroe signed on to star in what was then titled The Billionaire. The original script was written by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Norman Krasna. He was inspired to write the script after seeing Burt Lancaster do a dance at a Writers Guild Award ceremony and receive loud applause. He came up with the idea of a story about a very wealthy playboy like John Hay Whitney who hears about a company putting on a show that made fun of him and becomes enamored of the theater and a woman in the play. Krasna felt that only three actors were suitable \u2013 Gary Cooper, James Stewart and Gregory Peck \u2013 because all were so obviously not musical performers, making it funny if they sang and danced. Peck agreed to play the lead, and then Monroe was signed opposite him, even though Krasna preferred Cyd Charisse. With Monroe attached to the picture, she and Miller wanted the part of Amanda expanded, and Miller worked on the script (although he did not receive credit) to achieve this. Peck bowed out after the emphasis shifted to the female lead. Various sources state that the role was then offered to Rock Hudson, Cary Grant, and Charlton Heston, all of whom declined. It was eventually offered to Yves Montand, who had appeared in a French film version of Miller's The Crucible (1957) and had received praise for his recent one-man musical show in New York. Monroe and Miller both gave their approval for Montand in the role. The title was changed to Let's Make Love and production began in January 1960 with George Cukor directing. In March 1960, Monroe was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Musical or Comedy, further cementing the success of Some Like It Hot. Montand's wife Simone Signoret, with whom he had starred in the French version of The Crucible, won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Room at the Top in April. The two couples were soon inseparable; they had adjoining bungalows at the Beverly Hills Hotel."

        "content": "As House and his team work on the diagnosis of Vincent, a man with a massively swollen tongue and a high temperature, a disgruntled former patient named Jack Moriarty walks into House's office and shoots House twice with a handgun. Vincent develops two additional symptoms: blood leaking into his left eye, causing it to swell outward (and eventually be removed), and a burst testicle. The symptoms appear to have no possible connection to each other. Waking up from a coma two days later, House continues to treat Vincent from his hospital bed in the ICU with Moriarty, shot by hospital security and handcuffed to his bed, as his roommate. House wakes up Moriarty and asks why he wanted him to die. Moriarty replies that it was not his intention to kill House, and that he wanted to see House suffer. The reason Moriarty wanted to see House suffer was because his wife was a recent patient that House previously treated. While diagnosing her, House badgered Moriarty until he admitted that he had cheated on her. Despite this fact having no medical relevance to his wife's illness, House told her about the affair anyway. Moriarty's wife then committed suicide shortly after being released from the hospital. He tells House that he realizes that his affair led to his wife's suicide, however he feels that House should take part of the blame because there was \"no reason\" to tell her about it. Since the shooting, House feels decreased pain in his leg. He finds out from his records that during the surgery to treat the gunshot wounds, a treatment of ketamine to induce a coma had been given to relieve his leg pain, but he experiences neurological side effects. It becomes clear that House cannot separate fact from fiction, as hallucinations begin to get a stronger grasp on his sense of reality, from hitting Wilson to eating tacos outside the hospital. He begins to question his own ability to diagnose, while hostility increases between him and Moriarty. As Vincent\u2019s body begins to deteriorate, House struggles through his own self-doubts and must try to make sense of his life and world. House is seen hallucinating sitting in the passenger seat of Moriarty's wife's car next to her as she commits suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning (by starting her car with the garage door closed). House comes back to his hospital room from his daydreams and with sincerity tells Moriarty \"I'm sorry.\" After several hallucinations, House determines that nothing he has experienced since the shooting is real, and in order to snap out of his hallucination, decides to kill Vincent with the facility's surgical robot. House theorizes that doing this will push his mind past the point of reality and force it to believe the truth - that he is hallucinating. This is further proven when House's team tries to stop him from even using the robot, seemingly knowing he is going to kill Vincent; something that would not be possible unless everything he is experiencing is in his own mind. The surgical robot tears into Vincent and his vital signs disappear. At first, it seems House really killed him, but then Vincent drops a bullet he held in his hand. This is all the proof House needs that everything was just a hallucination, and he says \"goodbye\" before snapping back into reality. His theory proves to be true, and in the final minutes of the episode we see House being rushed into the ER moments after he was shot. Before the episode ends, House asks Cameron to tell Cuddy that he wants ketamine, which he supposedly received prior to the imagined events of the episode."

Bora's home life is a snore: she's mother to an infant child and her husband, Seo Min-ki (Choi Min-sik) has lost his job, leaving Bora as the family's sole breadwinner. It's unclear if Bora is with Il-beom just for the sex or for the passion, both of which Min-ki seems incapable of giving. But it seems the jobless Min-ki hasn't been just wandering around parks and reading romance novels as first thought; he knows something is going on, and he's collecting evidence. Min-ki has been emasculated by his inability to find a job and director Jung hammers this point home with a brief montage showing Min-ki grocery shopping, cooking, and doing the laundry. These are all very feminine jobs, particularly in very patriarchal South Korea. Most interesting is that Min-ki seems content to live with the cheating Bora, very much aware of his own shortcomings, which leaves him willing to be wronged. Bora is unable to stop going back to Il-beom even though she seems physically and emotionally damaged by their continued affair. Il-beom has realized that he is hooked on her, and is very aware of his jealously-driven actions toward her and her family. Without each other, they have no passion in their lives, and so they must keep going back to each other. Although Happy End ends rather unhappily, the film is not altogether downbeat. Director Jung Ji-woo has taken the role of observer, using mostly handheld cameras to capture the events in the lives of his 3 main subjects. The film is sexually explicit, and there is one scene of brutal violence."

Toshio's father, Takeo Omura, is an abusive, lazy veteran, who forces his wife, the boy's stepmother, Takeko Tamiguchi, to feign being hit by cars in order to shake down the motorists. When his wife is unable to perform the scam, Toshio is enlisted. The boy's confused perspective of the scams and his chaotic family life are vividly captured in precisely edited sequences. As marital strife, mounting abuse, and continual moving take their toll, the boy tries to escape, either by running away on trains, or by retreating into a sci-fi fantasy he has constructed for his little brother and himself. Finally, in snowy Hokkaid\u014d, the law finally catches up when the little brother unwittingly causes a fatal car accident. Although traumatized, Toshio tries to help his family elude capture in the final sequence, presented in documentary fashion, describing their arrest."

In September, the 15 person crew began a mobile sequential on-location shoot described by \u014cshima as cash-strapped and reliant on personal connections to complete, but marked by camaraderie and high spirits. The role of the boy was cast by searching in Tokyo children's homes, eventually finding the young orphan Tetsuo Abe. Abe's own life resembled the fractured childhood of the character he was to play, and he was allowed to join the production with the home's permission. Abe developed warm relationships with cast and crew, who tutored him while the film was being shot."

While at a nearby restaurant counting the proceeds from their latest \"gig,\" two lead band members meet a gypsy storyteller. She tells them the story of The Corsican Brothers. The story begins with the birth of two superfecund twin brothers, Louis and Lucien (played by adult Cheech and Chong as babies, children and adults), each by a different aristocratic French father; the two fathers end up dead in a botched duel over their partner's infidelity, with the twins raised as orphans. At age nine, their trait of feeling pain from the other's injuries becomes apparent (it becomes the film's predominant running gag); they accidentally burn down their house while playing with this power, and they decide to split up. At age 30, they reunite: Louis (now Lu\u00eds) wound up in Mexico working low-end jobs (though he claims to be a wealthy businessman) and Lucien, who stayed in France, has grown resentful of the royals' harsh treatment of peasants in the country, particularly that of the queen's regent, the sadistic (in more ways than one) Fuckaire, who usurped the king after his disappearance. The cowardly Lu\u00eds is reluctant to help his brother's revolutionary plans, but both find themselves drawn to two of the queen's daughters (played by Cheech and Chong's real-life wives). The crux of Lucien's scheme is to disguise themselves respectively as a gay Spaniard hairdresser and Nostradamus, who are prepared to visit the queen with the Marquis du Hickey. Despite a setback in which they are temporarily imprisoned because Lucien would rather fight outnumbered than flee from danger as Lu\u00eds wanted, Lucien manages to escape. At Lu\u00eds's execution, Lucien and the peasants storm the festivities, Lu\u00eds is freed and Fuckaire is deposed. As Lu\u00eds prepares for the dual wedding between the brothers and princesses, he suddenly fears for their future, and Lucien sweeps in to rescue him as they both leave the princesses at the altar, resolved to cross the globe and start a revolution in America. After their saga concludes, Los Guys resume playing in an outdoor cafe, covering Chuck Berry's \"Nadine,\" to an indifferent audience. Much of the film's humor comes from anachronisms: The Corsican Brothers is set in the 1840s (in the film it is portrayed closer to 18th-century, pre-revolution France), but Nostradamus, who lived and died three centuries prior, makes an appearance, and Lu\u00eds is said to have spent time in a modern-day Mexico."

He locks himself in his office, and she holds the supermarket shoppers hostage. Earlier that morning, Lynette Scavo discusses her nightmare from the previous night about Mary Alice Young with Susan and Gabrielle. Bree Van de Kamp confronts her husband Orson Hodge about the police report from the night he supposedly beat his first wife Alma. He convinces her that she suffered her injuries due to a fall after attacking him. Bree reveals that Carolyn gave her the report, and Orson mentions that Carolyn's husband is cheating on her. Nora Huntington tells Lynette and her husband Tom that she is moving to Mexico with Kayla, her daughter with Tom, despite their opposition. Gabrielle and her husband Carlos are settling the final terms of their separation. Carlos reveals that Gabrielle seduced him in order to stall the divorce as she believed he was coming into some money. The judge decides Carlos gets everything in the house and Gabrielle only gets the house. When they arrive home, each tries to destroy the property left to the other in the settlement. Bree tells Carolyn that Harvey has been cheating on her. She rings Harvey at the supermarket, and tells him she knows about Monique. He tries to tell her that Monique is dead. Carolyn then goes to a drawer and takes out a gun. Harvey calls Susan about what happened. Nora begins threatening Lynette to not apply for custody of Kayla. The two begin fighting when a gunshot is heard. This brings the story to the point at which the episode began. After Carolyn finds she can\u2019t get into Harvey's office, in which Edie Britt has also taken refuge, she turns around and takes the horrified shoppers hostage, including Lynette, Nora, Julie Mayer, Edie's nephew Austin McCann and new resident Art Shepherd. Gabrielle tells Carlos she hates the people they\u2019ve become and that she could easily be in Carolyn\u2019s place at the supermarket. He agrees that they should stop being \u201cthose people\u201d. In the supermarket, Nora tells Carolyn that Lynette is trying to steal her child. Lynette then says that Nora tried to seduce her husband. That hits too close to home for Carolyn, and she immediately shoots Nora in the chest. As Nora is dying, she asks Lynette to take care of Kayla for her. Lynette says she will raise Kayla as her daughter. Carolyn quarrels with Lynette about Nora and about Harvey. Carolyn eventually tries to shoot Lynette, but Art throws a can at Carolyn, knocking her off her balance and making her only shoot Lynette in her left arm. After dropping the gun, Carolyn and Austin struggle for it and one of the hostages picks it up and shoots Carolyn in the head. The hostages are released, and reunited with their loved ones waiting outside. In the hospital Lynette has a final dream of Mary Alice. Lynette asks Mary Alice if she is okay; Mary Alice says she\u2019s fine but Lynette knows she is lying. Mary Alice says she has to \u201cenjoy this beautiful day, as we get so few of them.\u201d As Lynette turns around, Mary Alice has disappeared. In a voiceover, she says that it is the last time Lynette would ever dream of her and for her sake she is grateful."

Betty arrives with his bagel, and Daniel decides he has found the person to write the review. Betty accepts the assignment from Daniel, but she and Walter had made plans to go to Atlantic City that weekend. Betty asks Walter to accompany her, but Walter declines, leaving Betty to visit the hotel on her own. Upon arrival, Betty finds herself being given the VIP treatment, including a massage given by a handsome man, only to be interrupted by Walter. After she explains the situation, both Betty and Walter agreed to spend time in the hotel, as long as Betty can finish her review. As they look at the less-than-desirable cuisine in the restaurant, Walter becomes frustrated and orders a cheeseburger and fries. Betty admits that she is embarrassed, while Walters tells Betty he doesn't know her anymore since she started working at Mode. After realizing what Walter said days later, Betty leaves a message on his phone to apologize. After returning home, Betty sees Walter sitting on her steps; they kiss and make up after she tells him that despite her job she is still a Queens girl. In Bradford's office, Wilhelmina is tasked to entertain a department store chain mogul from Texas. As Wilhelmina and Marc transform the office into \"The Lone Star State,\" the two get a chance to learn more about their guest, who arrives just in time to be given the intro and pitch by Wilhelmina, who also was thinking of Nico and the care packet she sent to her. But the Texan wants a lot more excitement, so instead of a planned dinner reservation, he takes Wilhelmina and Marc to a honky tonk bar. After an evening of shots, the guest agrees to sign the deal, telling her that he was impressed before he thought of the bar idea and tells Wilhelmina about what it is like to be a parent. Over at the Suarezes, Hilda tells Ignacio that she might be able to get money from her former boyfriend Santos, who also happens to be Justin's father, to pay Leah; though this does not sit well with either Ignacio or Justin. Later in the evening Hilda sees Santos playing dominoes and approaches him to ask about the money. Santos gives the money to Hilda on the condition that he sees Justin later in the evening. After she shows Ignacio the money, her dad is none too happy because of Santos' background, and it is made worse when she said he was stopping by. Hours later, Santos arrives at the Suarezes' - beaten up by thugs who wanted the money he gave Hilda. Hilda treats his wounds and tells him that he can still come by for Thanksgiving; much to Justin's chagrin. Meanwhile, Daniel is none too happy that Sofia is now taking up space in the magazine's conference room as she prepares to launch her new magazine. The sexually-charged banter between the two continues, along with accusations over his womanizing and her being a tease, and the two end up sharing an evening of unwinding over a game of pool at a bar. The following day, after Sofia finishes up using the conference room, Daniel hopes they will hook up for another night together, only to have Sofia drop a bombshell; she has a boyfriend. Daniel then rejects Betty's article claiming it isn't right for Mode. Upset over the rejection, Betty seeks solace in the bathroom when Sofia gives her encouragement and offers to publish the article in her magazine. After she leaves, Betty's mood turns to excitement as she does a dance in the bathroom."

The next morning, an 8-year-old girl named Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) arrives on Joe's doorstep saying that she is his biological daughter, and that his divorced wife, Sara, sent her there to meet him. His agent, Stella Peck (Kyra Sedgwick), thinks this will be bad for his image and distracts him with the upcoming playoffs. At the opening of his own restaurant/night club & bar, Joe inadvertently leaves without Peyton, and is on the cover of a tabloid the next day. Stella decides Joe needs a new fatherly image. At a later press conference, the reporters make Joe miserable, until Peyton comes to his defense, saying that he is new to this and trying the best he can, and that she thinks he is the best father in the world. Peyton then says that Joe has to repay her, so she has him take her to a ballet academy run by Monique Vasquez (Roselyn S\u00e1nchez). Monique has Joe join their ballet performance to show him that ballet takes just as much athletic ability as football. Joe and Peyton begin their relationship after Peyton calls his arrogant and selfish behavior to his attention. Joe takes Peyton and her new friends to the mall where he begins to develop romantic feelings for Monique. The Rebels march through the playoffs via three road games: Denver in the Wild Card round, Indianapolis in the Divisional round and finally Baltimore in the Conference round. They eventually make it to the championship game held in Arizona in a rematch with the New York Dukes. Stella offers Joe a $25 million endorsement deal with Fanny's Burgers, a successful fast food restaurant run by Samuel Blake, Jr., if he wins the game and mentions the product to the press. While at lunch with Joe and Monique at the Barking Crab, Peyton accidentally reveals that she was scheduled to go to a ballet school program for the month, but instead she ran away to meet her father. Before anything else can be said, Peyton has an allergic reaction to the nuts in the dessert she was eating, and Joe rushes her to the hospital; however, the doctors tell him that the reaction is mild, and his daughter is going to be fine. Joe's former sister-in-law and Peyton's legal guardian, Karen Kelly, arrives to take her home and reveals to Joe that Sara was killed in a traffic accident six months earlier. After Peyton overhears Stella explaining that she would be a huge distraction to Joe, Karen and Peyton return home. Later, while going through Peyton's bag under her bed, Joe finds some photos and reads a letter from Sara, saying that she hid Peyton away from Joe, as his career was just starting and she didn\u2019t want Peyton to be a distraction to him. As the championship game begins, Joe's mind is not fully set on the game and he is soon injured. Joe is then surprised to discover that Peyton has arrived with Karen. Understanding Joe's earlier words about how he wants to remain in Peyton's life, Karen decides to let Peyton live with Joe. Near the end of the fourth quarter, Joe passes the ball to the running back, Jamal Webber, who gains positive yardage but fails to get out of bounds. Joe hurries his team to the line with the clock running, and rushes ahead before being knocked out of bounds. With time for one last play, Joe throws a lob pass to Sanders, who catches the pass, allowing the Rebels to win their first championship. In a post-game interview, Joe declines the Fanny's Burgers offer to be with Peyton."

During trials, the hands of a girl named Amber spontaneously combust. An unknown person is shown to be using Barbie dolls dressed as cheerleaders in a voodoo-like ritual over a cauldron. The next day, Cordelia is struck blind during her drivers ed class, and is saved from wandering into traffic in the nick of time by Buffy. According to Giles, blinding enemies is a favorite trick amongst witches. Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen), another contender, seems to be under intense pressure to compete from her domineering mother (Robin Riker), a star cheerleader in her day, and is crushed when she only makes the substitute list after Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) and Buffy. Believing Amy to be a witch, Buffy, Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) collect some of Amy's hair during science class, to prove that she cast the spells. Amy goes home and orders her mother to do her homework, while she goes upstairs with a bracelet she stole from Buffy during class. The next morning Buffy is behaving in a somewhat unstable manner. She blows her chance at the cheerleading squad when she tosses the head cheerleader, Joy, through the room, ceding her place to Amy. Buffy turns out to have something more than just a mood disorder: a bloodstone vengeance spell has destroyed her immune system, giving her only about three hours to live. The only way to cure her and break the other spells is to get the witch's spell book and reverse the magic. The ailing Buffy and Giles confront Amy's mother, Catherine, and find out that Catherine switched bodies with her daughter months before, saying that Amy was wasting her youth, so she took it for herself. Giles finds the witch's book and takes Amy and Buffy back to the school to break the spells. Amy/Catherine is cheering Sunnydale's basketball team when she starts getting flashes of what Giles is trying to do. Xander and Willow are unable to stop her from storming into the science lab with an axe but buy enough time for Giles to break the spells: Amy and Catherine are restored to their own bodies, and Buffy feels well enough to fight. However, Amy's mother's power is too great, and it is only by reflecting her last spell back onto her that Buffy saves the day. Catherine vanishes with a scream. After her mother\u2019s disappearance, Amy\u2019s father is delighted to have her live with him, and she tells Buffy she is really happy to finally have a normal parent/child relationship. As the two girls walk through the school hall together, they pass by the trophy collection where the cheerleading trophy of \"Catherine the Great\" stands. While both girls wonder where Amy's mother ended up, the camera pulls close to the statue's face, revealing the mother's eyes and a muffled voice pleading for help."

        "content": "Soon after the Great War, Major Foster (Gene Hackman), the commander of a detachment of the French Foreign Legion, suffers the haunting memories of leading an army of 8,000, now reduced to 200. He has become an alcoholic as a result, and his only friend is his faithful Sergeant, Triand (Rufus). Foster arrives in Paris to assume a new command: to return to the Rif in Morocco to re-establish French authority, as the Bedouin and Berber tribes have begun to revolt against French rule. Foster is also ordered to escort archaeologists from the Louvre, who are uncovering an ancient city near Erfoud, buried by a sand storm 3,000 years ago. The site is the final resting place of a Berber saint, \"The Angel of the Desert\". Foster was chosen for the assignment, as he is the only French officer alive who served in Morocco before the war. He had helped to develop diplomatic ties with the tribes, especially with El Krim (Ian Holm), the de facto leader of the scattered Rif tribes. Foster had vowed to El Krim that there would be no further archeological excavations. Foster's force is assembled. Among those who volunteer, willingly or unwillingly, is \"the Gypsy\" Marco Segrain (Terence Hill), a charming jewel thief famous for a three-year crime spree on the Riviera until French authorities managed to apprehend him. Gypsy befriends three other recruits: the Russian giant Ivan (Jack O'Halloran), formerly a member of the elite bodyguard of the deposed Russian Imperial family; \"Top Hat\" Gilbert Francis (Andr\u00e9 Penvern), a fashionable man and musician who lacks the physical traits needed in a soldier; and Fredrick Hastings (Paul Sherman), a romantic young English aristocrat who missed the Great War. The four friends are soon disillusioned by the harsh realities of life in the Legion. A fatal fight breaks out among the men while traveling to Morocco over an insult to Maj. Foster's honor, to which Sgt. Triand takes exception.  Foster does not hesitate to harshly discipline his men, especially Marco, who frequently disobeys orders, though he does care for his fellow legionaries. During the voyage, Marco charms Madame Picard (Catherine Deneuve). During their land journey to the Legion fortress, the train carrying the Legionnaires and the archaeological team is stopped by El Krim and his men. El Krim greets his old friend Foster but also declares that he is determined to unite the Berber tribes to drive the French out of Morocco. El Krim gives a \"gift\" to Foster to take back to the Premier of France: the archaeologists of an earlier dig, who have had their eyes and tongues gouged out and subjected to exposure. He warns Foster not to continue with the excavation. In response, Foster shoots the two mutilated archaeologists; afterwards, it is revealed that one of them was Madame Picard's father. Training in the desert is so harsh, it pushes Top Hat to commit suicide. Later, at the digging site, Hastings is kidnapped while on guard duty and tortured to death by one of El Krim's men, whom El Krim excuses as being merely over-zealous. Marco retaliates. Instead of disciplining him, Foster merely defends him, using El Krim's previous excuse for the actions of his own man. Eventually, the tomb of the Angel of the Desert is found, and her golden sarcophagus is excavated. Foster offers it to El Krim as a token of peace, but El Krim rallies the warriors of the Bedouin tribes to fight a climactic battle. With the Legionnaires being heavily outnumbered, the digging site is eventually overrun. Ivan is killed, but Marco fights on, single-handedly fending off a flank attack. When Foster is killed, El Krim immediately calls off the fight, sending the surviving Legionnaires \"to tell the world what happened\" and out of respect for his dead friend. There are two endings: the TV version ends with Marco taking up Mme Picard's offer to desert. The theatrical ending shows Marco (after having been promoted for his bravery in battle) staying behind and training more Legionnaire recruits, welcoming them by reiterating Foster's warning: \"If the Legion doesn't get you, the desert will. If the desert doesn't, the Arabs will. And if the Arabs don't, then I will. I don't know which is worse.\""

The sadistic second-in-command of the company, Lt Fontaine and his equally vicious crony the Corporal lead a patrol to capture them. They catch up with the two Germans and Fontaine orders the patrol to shoot them. The noise attracts a large group of Bedouin tribesmen and, disregarding the warnings from his men, Fontaine orders his men to open fire, igniting a battle. The Corporal is shot dead and Fontaine breaks down in fear and kills himself. Marco displays his courage and natural flair for leadership by rallying the survivors of the patrol and successfully beating off the attackers. In the video release, this scene was omitted but brief shots of Fontaine and the Corporal were taken from this scene and edited into the climactic battle at the digging site so it appears that both men died there instead."

Although Sheriff Buck Hastings would like to arrest Gant, he points out to the townsmen that Gant always coerces his rivals to draw their gun first, allowing him to kill them legally in \"self-defense.\"  While the men in the town speculate anxiously about Gant's target, Luke Canfield (played by Charles Drake, an off-screen friend and frequent co-star with Murphy), the town blacksmith and doctor, greets Gant and is totally unaware of Gant's reputation as a hired gunman. During his first meeting with Gant at the smithy, Luke demonstrates his perfect aim with a maul. Luke proudly takes Gant on a tour through town and agrees to join him later for a game of chess. At home, Luke's fianc\u00e9e, Anne Benson, tends to her father, Judge Benson, who suffers from consumption. Luke's father Asa joins them for dinner, during which Buck arrives to warn Luke to stay away from Gant. Asa cautions Buck not to condemn Gant prematurely, but Buck is reluctant to accept his advice and reveals that he feels he will be powerless against Gant's superior gun skills. Later, mine owners Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce assume that their partner, Ben Chaffee, has hired Gant to kill them to take sole ownership of the mine . When they find Gant in the saloon and propose a counter-offer, however, Gant observes that no innocent man would be afraid, and turns them away. Upon hearing that Stricker and Pierce were seen talking with Gant, Chaffee assumes that they want to kill him. He questions Luke about Gant, and after Luke fails to calm him, the physician walks through town, noting that the townsmen are all hiding behind guns and locked doors. While clerk Lou Fraden and his wife Roseanne discuss their certainty that her ex-husband has sent Gant to kill them, Luke confronts Gant, asking him why he has come. Impressed with Luke's bravery and integrity, Gant explains that he believes that Luke, who saves the lives of men \"who deserve to die,\" is less ethical than he. While they talk, a panicked Pierce shoots himself in his office and dies later that night. After this, Luke accuses Gant of murder. When Buck tries to throw Gant out of town, Gant refuses to leave. When the sheriff pulls a gun on Gant, Gant shoots him in the hand and renders him useless. When asked why Gant did n0t kill him, the gunman explains it was because no one was paying him. Later, Judge Benson advocates using vigilante law to throw out Gant, but after Luke protests, suggests sacrificing the one man Gant is after  to save the rest of the town. Meanwhile, Fraden, emboldened by alcohol, confronts Gant, who calmly encourages him to draw his gun. At Luke's urging, Fraden flees, leaving Luke to demand fruitlessly that Gant leave town. Next, Stricker gathers the townsmen to challenge Gant, and although Luke disapproves, he agrees to lead them, hoping to minimize the possible violence. Gant, angered to see Luke backed by a mob, warns the men that if they shoot him, he will still live long enough to kill Luke, saloon owner Henry Reeger (another man afraid Gant is after him), Asa, Stricker, and several other town leaders. The men disband silently. Later, Luke confesses to Judge Benson that he likes Gant, and the judge warns him that Gant's viciousness is a progressive disease that he cannot cure. In the store the next day, Gant approaches Anne and questions her about her home life, but e will not reveal his target. At the same time, the judge speculates to Luke that if the hunted man refused to defend himself, Gant could be legally arrested for murder, but Luke declares that no man could die without fighting. Soon after, Chafee kills Stricker in a shootout, prompting Sheriff Hastings to take off his badge and drop it on the street. Anne, who has grown suspicious about her father the judge, reads a letter locked in his drawer that reveals a past crime. Realizing the likelihood that Gant has been hired to kill her father, she goes to Gant's room with a gun. Gant bluffs her that her gun is unloaded, and then easily takes it away from her. Anne declares that the judge will not defend himself, prompting Gant to rip off a piece of the upper part of her dress. Gant goes to the judge's home and tells him that his \"friends from back East send their respects\". The old man admits his past guilt and tells Gant that he knows enough to send himself, the governor, and several other wealthy and powerful men to prison, but all they have to do is wait and nature will do Gant's job for him. Unfortunately, his old associates are impatient. Of course, the Judge refuses to fight. Gant then shows him the piece of Anne's dress and implies that he has raped her. The old judge is angered enough to grab a rifle and follow Gant outside. The old man has severe coughing and fires a wild shot before collapsing on the porch steps. Luke arrives and sees Gant with his gun drawn and assumes that Gant shot the old man. Luke starts to throw a hammer at him, but Gant shoots him in the right shoulder. As Gant is walking away toward his horse, Luke uses his left arm to throw a hammer. Just as Gant turns around, he is struck in the upper part of his gun arm and breaking it, so that Gant can no longer shoot. As Gant laboriously mounts his horse, Asa tells Luke that the old man was not shot. Luke offers to tend to his arm, but Gant replies, \"Everything comes to a finish\" and rides away."

He interests a steel mill owner in a supply of cut-price coke, and forges the steel mill owner's signature on a contract to persuade the mine owner to supply it. Flush with success, he starts talking of helping to improve the lot of the men he used to work with, but his first taste of big business goes to his head. He marries the steel mill owner's daughter, much to Josie's dismay, but soon feels out of his depth at the wedding reception and other formal gatherings. As Pittsburgh follows his lonely path to further heights of financial wizardry and big business success, his old ideals fall by the wayside. He puts his father-in-law out of the business and he betrays the men that he had promised to help. He even puts a stop to research into a new medicine to be developed from coal tar to relieve world suffering because it doesn't show any profit. Cash draws the line and demands to be let out of his partnership with Pittsburgh. When the men stage a revolt against Pittsburgh in the mine, he goes down to tackle them singlehanded, as bold and confident as ever, and Cash follows to intercede before trouble can break out, putting the dispute on a personal level between him and Pittsburgh and turning it into a fistfight. Pittsburgh's success goes sour, Cash abandons him, his wife walks out, and Josie is badly hurt in a mine accident. He is all alone. He tries to win friends by putting right his past mistakes. Cash and Josie marry and Pittsburgh's business folds up under him. Only now does he feel genuinely repentant, but it is too late. As World War II engages America, he goes to work for Cash's new company under an assumed name, starting at the bottom. Soon his ideas for improving output command Cash's attention and when the new employee comes to meet the boss only Josie prevents them from quarreling bitterly, giving the film a patriotic message that the important thing at this time of war is \"devotion to our country.\" With the three united as friends again, it remains for Pittsburgh to make one small assertion of his old arrogance. Given the job of production manager by Cash, he upgrades himself to being his partner."

During the rally, several masked gunmen jump out of a meat truck and steal $87,000 in donated cash from the back of an armored car. Two Harlem detectives, \"Gravedigger\" Jones and \"Coffin Ed\" Johnson, chase the car, and a bale of cotton falls out of the vehicle, unremarked at the time. Though the authorities approve of O'Malley, regarding his \"Back-to-Africa\" movement as a way to solve American racial problems, both Jones and even more so Johnson are hostile towards him, viewing him as a charlatan who is exploiting the impoverished black community of Harlem. Captain Bryce\u2014who has a portrait of Richard Nixon prominently displayed in his office\u2014tells Jones and Johnson not to treat O'Malley as a suspect, orders that the duo ignore. Jones and Johnson go to the apartment of Iris Brown, O'Malley's mistress, believing he will come to see her at some point, but are called away. Iris is able to escape from the policeman sent to guard her. Iris is shocked to discover O'Malley seducing Mabel Hill, the widow of one of his subordinates killed in the robbery, leading to a fight between the two women and Iris being disillusioned with O'Malley. Uncle Budd, a scavenger, finds the bale of cotton and sells it for $25 to a junk dealer, but later buys it back for $30. There is a reward out for the $87,000, and Gravedigger and Coffin deduce that the money was  hidden inside the bale that fell out of the getaway vehicle during the chase, leading to a violent search as rival gangsters seek the money. Iris tells Jones and Johnson the truth\u2014namely that the robbery was part of a plan to allow O'Malley to steal the money without discrediting himself, but that he was double-crossed by his partner Calhoun, a white career criminal whom he met in prison who decided to take the money for himself. Calhoun kidnaps Iris to torture her for information about where the bale is, but after a shoot-out, Jones and Johnson rescue her. At a theater in Harlem, Iris's friend, the dancer Billie, uses the bale of cotton as part of her act, which attracts both Calhoun and O'Malley to the theater. Jones and Johnson arrest and humiliate Calhoun\u2014who was dressed in blackface\u2014at the theater. In the back of the theater, Johnson beats O'Malley in a fight. Jones and Johnson expose the Reverend O\u2019Malley to the audience of the theater as the fraud that he is, remarking that he could had been another Marcus Garvey or Malcolm X, but instead he chose to be just a petty conman who exploited ordinary people. As O'Malley begs for support, the audience turn their backs on him and walks out. Detectives Jones and Johnson then blackmail Tom, a white mob leader, to give them $87,000 \u2014 to be restored to the original donors \u2014 after discovering that Uncle Budd has run off with the stolen money and emigrated to Ghana, to live in retirement with his ill-gotten gains and a harem."

This helped to put a positive spotlight on Harlem, which at the time was ravaged with crime. Seeing that the film would be shot in Harlem, and was featuring large crowd scenes, such as riots and rallies, John Shabazz (a former bodyguard for Malcolm X) and the so-called Black Citizens Patrol volunteered to control the scenes with their experience in keeping out unwanted spectators and policing traffic. The Black Citizens Patrol's purpose was to protect the black community from itself, so they made themselves available at all times, even operating as an escort service. The film saw the debut of Calvin Lockhart, Judy Pace, and Cleavon Little. Another debut was by Redd Foxx, already well known as a veteran nightclub comic, leading him to be considered for the TV Show Sanford and Son. Cambridge also starred as a white man who turns black in the motion picture comedy Watermelon Man, which opened the same day as Cotton Comes to Harlem. Melba Moore, who sang the film's theme song, \u201cAin\u2019t Now But It\u2019s Gonna Be\u201d (written by Ossie Davis) was contemporaneously starring in the hit Broadway musical, Purlie!

Because Clarence was a dangerous criminal, they had to clear a whole floor to examine and treat him. House got Stacy to get a court order. Cuddy wasn't in favor of this plan and wanted him out as soon as he got better.  They had to send him back to death row as soon as he got better to receive his death penalty. House killed him by curing him. The team realizes that the inmate had much acid in his blood and speculated he was taking drugs. The reason for the delay was the doctors not testing for the drug. It was unexpected. House sends Chase back to prison to inspect the cell Clarence was sleeping in, in order to find the cause of all the acid by deduction toner solvent. House tricks Clarence to a whisky slammer session to displace hepatic metabolism of the deadly cocktail.

As the couple waits for the rest of the party to arrive, Andy tells Liz the story of how his friends Mickey and Ellen came to fall in love. As each of Andy's friends arrive, more of the story is unfolded. Mickey Gordon is a National Basketball Association referee who honors his recently deceased father's wishes by burying him at the resting site of his World War II Army platoon in France, of which he was the sole survivor, but the plans are delayed after the airline misplaces the casket. Ellen Andrews, an airline employee from Wichita working in Paris, assists Mickey in locating and retrieving the casket. She surprises Mickey by attending the burial so he will not be alone. Mickey rides back to Paris with Ellen, and the two get to know each other along the way. Mickey decides to delay his return trip to the United States to spend time with Ellen. The two fall in love, but Mickey is forced to return for the beginning of the NBA season. Mickey's loneliness leads him to lose his temper during a nationally televised game. Mickey is suspended by the NBA for a week. During the suspension, he returns to Paris to see Ellen. Mickey learns Ellen is married but separated, and is unsure if she and her husband will get back together. While Mickey is in Charlotte to referee a game, Ellen arrives to meet him and reveals that she has gotten a divorce. Having quit her job in France, Ellen marries Mickey. After a honeymoon period spent on the road during the NBA season, the couple settles in the San Fernando Valley outside Mickey's hometown of Los Angeles. When the next basketball season begins, Ellen takes an entry-level customer service job with American Airlines, while Mickey travels with the NBA. Hating her new job and only seeing Mickey a few days each month, Ellen becomes lonely and depressed. She asks Mickey to quit his job; he compromises by taking a one-year leave of absence and briefly working as a car salesman. Ellen  gets promoted and climbs the corporate ladder, leaving Mickey at home to tend to her rather senile father, Arthur. Mickey, unhappy at home with Arthur, decides to return early to the NBA. He comes home from a road trip to find Ellen gone. Before he can read her note, she arrives and explains that she had simply returned to Kansas to deliver Arthur to her siblings so she and Mickey can be alone and repair their marriage. Ellen approaches Mickey and says she has been offered a transfer to Dallas. Mickey refuses to move away from California, so Ellen takes the airline's other offer of a transfer to Paris. Now separated, the two are seemingly content in their original arrangements: Mickey traveling with the NBA, and Ellen working for an airline in Paris. It is obvious to all of their friends that they miss each other's company. At the restaurant, Andy's friends have caught Liz up to date, with the latest development coming four months prior. A basketball fan enters the restaurant and informs the group of an odd occurrence during the traditional singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" prior to that night's New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. Mickey decides to go AWOL from his job and immediately return to Paris to find Ellen. Before he can make it across the basketball court, he spots Ellen in the arena. The two meet and reconcile at mid-court, and as the arena lights come on after the anthem, the entire crowd sees the two kissing. Mickey and Ellen arrive at the restaurant together and re-tell Liz the story of their relationship."

The episode first aired on the UPN network on February 12, 1997, as part of sweeps week. It was written by producer Kenneth Biller, and is the second episode to be directed by cast member Robert Duncan McNeill. It marked the first major appearance of the Borg in Voyager, which were kicked off with a teaser ending in the prior episode. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation. In this episode, while on an away mission, Chakotay is taken in by a group of former Borg who seek help from the crew of Voyager to reactivate their neural link. The ex-Borg force Chakotay to reactivate a Borg cube (a large Borg spaceship), but, in their new-found \"Co-operative\", the ex-Borg make the cube self-destruct, saving Voyager. Biller was influenced by the story of the Tower of Babel in writing the episode, and also considered the dissolution of the Soviet Union to be an influence. The crew re-used the make-up and costumes of the Borg designed for the film Star Trek: First Contact, but sets were not re-used. A new fully computer generated Borg cube was created for \"Unity\", and the storyline of the episode was intended as a hint to those in the later two-part episode \"Scorpion\". According to Nielsen ratings, it received a 5.4/8 percent share of the audience on first broadcast. \"Unity\" was received positively by critics, with praise directed at McNeill's direction as well as Biller's plot."

They land the vessel but come under fire from hostile aliens, killing Kaplan and injuring Chakotay. He wakes in a room with a woman called Riley Frazier (Lori Hallier). She informs him that she is part of a group of survivors on the planet from a variety of races. There are other groups nearby, including those that attacked him. She calls her group a \"Co-operative\". Meanwhile, the USS Voyager discovers a derelict Borg cube and Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) decides that an investigation is required in order to learn more about the Borg's technology. An away team boards the cube, discovering that either an accident or another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks out of his room where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet. Chakotay pleads their case, but Janeway decides not to help them. As Chakotay returns to Voyager on board a shuttle, the Co-operative use their telepathic link to force him to travel to the Borg cube with Voyager in pursuit. Both Chakotay and an away team board the cube, and despite a firefight, he manages to reactivate the generator. This creates the new joint mind as expected, but also activates the cube, which begins powering up to attack Voyager. Chakotay and the away team are beamed back to Voyager as the Co-operative trigger the cube's self-destruct before it can endanger the Federation ship. The planet's inhabitants thank Voyager, but as a result of their actions, Chakotay later questions the morality of the Co-operative's motives with Janeway, as it connected many of the former Borg together in a new hive mind without consulting them."

There were concerns from some of the crew that the events of the film Star Trek: First Contact effectively destroyed the Borg, but executive producer Rick Berman clarified both that the death of the Borg Queen in the film did not mean the destruction of the entire collective and that there were other Borg remaining in the Delta Quadrant. The alien race had made their first appearance in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Q Who\" and, at the time of the original broadcast of \"Unity\", had recently appeared in First Contact. The idea of Borg being separated from the collective had previously been seen in the episode of The Next Generation entitled \"I, Borg\" with the resultant effect seen in the two-part \"Descent\". \"Unity\" was written by producer Kenneth Biller, with the final version of the script being submitted on November 7, 1996. Though the film had not been released at the time he drafted the episode, Biller had read the First Contact script before writing the \"Unity\" script. Biller sought to give a more interesting look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation. With this in mind, he thought of an idea based upon the Tower of Babel. He said that the Borg was a \"incredibly interwoven, complex community\" and \"once you knocked it all down you would have all these people who spoke different languages, and couldn't communicate with each other. It occurred to me that a group of ex-Borg would be a very interesting community to explore.\" He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union."

On December 23, Booth brings in the skeletal remains of a man found dead in a bomb shelter discovered recently. Everyone is in Christmas-Eve mode with a company party going on upstairs. Bones and the rest of the team start investigating the dead man's story when Zack triggers the bio-hazard alarm while cutting through the skeleton. The lab is shut down for containment and every one is under quarantine based on the discovery of a fungus causing Valley fever (even though it's not actually contagious). The prospect of spending the two mandatory quarantine days away from friends and family makes everyone morose. Booth develops a side-effect of euphoria due to drugs given to immunize them from the disease. The case, meanwhile, progresses into the discovery of a love affair between the dead man, Lionel Little, who worked as a lease inspector for a company called Silver Cloud Petroleum and had a coin collection, and his black cleaning lady (Ivy Gillespie) in the late 1950s. Due to the oppressive racial climate in the US, they planned to emigrate to France. Lionel tried to sell his valuable coin collection to a shifty con artist who murdered Lionel to procure the collection (worth approximately $8000 at the time). An emotional segment in the show occurs when everyone gets to meet their family and friends with Christmas carols crooning in the background. We find out that Booth has a 4-year-old son named Parker (because his mother didn\u2019t marry him, his parental rights are vague), and that Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top is Angela's father. With everyone else in the lab celebrating Christmas with secret Santa gifts, Bones decides to track down Ivy and reveal the lethal mystery behind Lionel's disappearance to her. Bones does this on Angela's advice. Angela says that Bones must find Ivy so she can have the closure that Temperance herself never had (her parents disappeared when she was 15, and no information has been uncovered regarding their whereabouts). Bones, listening to her friend, goes to her office and starts making phone calls trying to locate Ivy Gillespie. Finally, on Christmas morning, she finds Ivy\u2019s granddaughter who provides information to contact her. Bones asks Booth to look at the penny they found in Lionel\u2019s pocket. She scanned it to find out that it was actually a bronze penny minted in 1943, unlike almost all pennies from that time that were made of zinc clad steel to conserve copper for World War II. Today, there are just 12 of them and it is worth over $100,000 dollars. Dr. Goodman enters telling them that it is time for the results. They are all together waiting for the results as the Head of the Jeffersonian and other guys in biohazard suits are running them in a computer and a green light turns on. They remove their helmets and one of them tells \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d. They all start walking out the Jeffersonian but Temperance stays behind. When Booth realizes it he stops and turns to her, she just says: \u201cGo, go have Christmas. Wish your boy a Merry Christmas from me,\u201d to which he says: \u201cI\u2019m at Wong Foo\u2019s if you decide you want company. Merry Christmas Bones,\u201d and he leaves. A young and an elderly woman came in the lab. They are Lisa Pearce (granddaughter) and Ivy Gillespie. Bones takes them to her office and she starts explaining all that happened. Ivy starts crying when she realizes that she wasn't abandoned by Lionel; that he was actually trying to keep his promise to go to Paris. But that is not all the happiness that Temperance gave them. Lisa wants to be a doctor but can\u2019t afford it, but Brennan gives her and her grandmother Lionel's 1943 bronze penny, worth over $100,000. After visiting Booth at Wong Foo's, Bones returns to the lab alone and retrieves several wrapped gifts and cards from an old suitcase; it was previously explained that when her parents went missing around Christmas, Brennan had childishly refused to open their presents to her until they returned - which they never did.  Sitting alone on the couch with Angela's holographic Christmas tree and leftover decorations still up, Temperance finally opens her parents' gifts to her and smiles through her tears."

The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter, directed by David Nutter, and featured the first of two guest appearances by Nick Chinlund as the death fetishist killer Donnie Pfaster. The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode was viewed by 8.8 million people upon its first broadcast, and received positive reviews, with much praise to Chinlund's performance as the antagonist. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a death fetishist who begins kidnapping and killing women to satisfy his obsession. Scully, still recovering from her earlier abduction, is soon overcome with posttraumatic stress disorder. \"Irresistible\" is one of the few in the series that was intended to have no paranormal elements to it. Initially, the script called for Donnie Pfaster to be a necrophiliac, but the idea was soon rejected by the Fox Broadcasting Company for being \"unacceptable for broadcast standards\". Pfaster was eventually brought back in the season seven episode \"Orison\", retconning him as an actual demon."

Later that night, as the girl's body is being stored for burial the following day, Pfaster's boss finds him cutting off the corpse's hair. Pfaster is promptly fired. Some time later, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are summoned to Minneapolis by Moe Bocks, an FBI field agent who is investigating the exhumation and desecration of a body in a local cemetery. Mulder discounts Bocks' theory that this act is a variation of extraterrestrial cattle mutilation, and suggests they search for a human culprit. Scully is disturbed at the sight of the disheveled corpse. Two more bodies are found exhumed, with their hair cut and fingernails removed. Mulder develops a psychological profile of the criminal, believing him to be an escalating \"death fetishist\" who may resort to murder to satisfy his desires. Scully keeps her discomfort with the case to herself, and writes up a field report on necrophilia. Pfaster, who is behind the exhumations, proves Mulder's prediction correct when he brings a prostitute to his apartment.

He is arrested and is placed in a jail cell across from a suspect being interrogated for Pfaster's crimes by Mulder, Scully, and Bocks. Pfaster shows interest in Scully, and learns her name from the interrogated suspect. Pfaster is later released as his charges are dropped. Scully is deeply troubled by Pfaster's crimes, and has unsettling dreams and hallucinations about the case. In Washington, she has a counseling session with a social worker, during which she shares her anxiety about the investigation. After the session, Scully learns that someone from Minnesota had called for her. When she contacts Mulder, she learns that neither he nor Bocks made the call. Tracing a fingerprint to Pfaster from his arrest, Bocks and Mulder raid his apartment, finding one of the prostitute's fingers in his refrigerator. Meanwhile, after Scully arrives in Minneapolis, Pfaster forces her car off the road. He kidnaps Scully and takes her to his late mother's abandoned house. He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet. Mulder and Bocks discover that Pfaster's mother had owned a car which matches paint found on Scully's abandoned car, tracking down her former residence. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from Pfaster as he prepares a cold bath for her, resulting in a pursuit through the house. Scully and Pfaster have a struggle that sends them falling down a staircase onto the foyer, where a task force led by Mulder and Bocks breaks in moments later and apprehends Pfaster. Scully initially insists that she is okay, but then breaks down and cries in Mulder's arms. In a voice-over narration, Mulder traces Pfaster's pathology to his childhood, when he was raised in a family of four older sisters. Mulder also reflects on Pfaster's nature and the nature of evil in general."

        "content": "The episode's initial script where Pfaster was a necrophiliac was rejected by the Fox Broadcasting Company for being \"unacceptable for broadcast standards\". As series creator Chris Carter described it, \"When I handed the script in, it was really for a necrophiliac episode, and that just didn't fly. You cannot do the combination of sex and death on network television.\" Carter was forced to tone down the script by changing Pfaster from a necrophiliac to a death fetishist and diminishing Pfaster's sexual obsession. He considered that the sexual content was \"implied and understood by audiences\", and that Pfaster still resulted in a creepy character, particularly his \"creepy arrogance\" in using shampoo on the hair of his victims. The episode's original title was \"Fascination\". The episode is one of the few in the series that has no paranormal elements to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, \"My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of.  The idea of dying at the hands of someone\u2014creature or not\u2014and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character.\" The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: \"There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed.\" Nutter said \"In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door.\" Carter said of the casting of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, \"I thought it was a wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of androgynous quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you.\" Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated \"Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that.\" Nutter said of the episode \"I really worked hard to make it a special show, because I thought it was special. It was Gillian's post-traumatic stress episode, because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen.\" Carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed Scully hugs Mulder, claiming it was a \"tender moment\" between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other."

Both versions feature leading actress Greta Garbo. In the early years of sound films, Hollywood studios produced foreign-language versions of some of their films using the same sets and sometimes the same costumes, with native speakers of the language usually replacing some or all of the original cast. The German-language version of Anna Christie is one of the few that survives. The film was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at their Culver City, California studio in July and August 1930 (the English-language original had been filmed there in October and November 1929). It premiered in Cologne, Germany on December 2, 1930. Garbo is the only cast member appearing in both versions and looks noticeably different in the two. The German dialog was written by Walter Hasenclever and Frank Reicher, for the most part very closely following Frances Marion's original adaptation. The film was directed by Jacques Feyder using the same cinematographer, Garbo favorite William H. Daniels, but a different crew."

It was directed by Nick Marck, and written by series creator Chris Carter based on a story developed by Carter and lead actor David Duchovny. \"Colony\" featured guest appearances by Megan Leitch, Peter Donat and Brian Thompson. The episode helped explore the series' overarching mythology. \"Colony\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.3, being watched by 9.8 million households in its initial broadcast. \"Colony\" is a two-part episode, with the plot continuing in the next episode, \"End Game\". The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the murders of human clones working in abortion clinics at the hands of a shapeshifting assassin (Thompson). Mulder receives news that his younger sister Samantha (Leitch), who had been abducted as a child, may have returned. \"Colony\" introduced the recurring role of the Alien Bounty Hunter. Actor Brian Thompson auditioned and later won the role. Frank Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast this character, but they knew this casting would be important since he was intended to be a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very \"distinctive look\" about him, most notably his face and mouth."

As Mulder is lowered into a tub of water, Dana Scully bursts in and tells the doctors that the cold is the only thing keeping him alive. Suddenly, Mulder's heart monitor flatlines. Two weeks earlier, in the Beaufort Sea, crewmen on a ship spot a light in the sky that soon crashes into the sea. A body is retrieved from the crash, revealed to be an Alien Bounty Hunter. Two days later, the Bounty Hunter arrives at an abortion clinic in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and kills a doctor by stabbing him in the back of the neck with a stiletto weapon, then sets the building on fire and escapes. Mulder receives emails containing the doctor's obituary along with two other identical doctors. After interviewing a pro-life priest who had threatened one of the doctors, they are able to use a newspaper advertisement looking for one of the men to track another one, Aaron Baker, to Syracuse, New York. Mulder has a fellow FBI agent, Barrett Weiss, visit Baker's residence. Weiss and Baker are both killed by the Bounty Hunter, who impersonates Weiss and tells Mulder and Scully that no one is home. After Walter Skinner hears of Weiss' death and closes the case, the agents meet CIA official Ambrose Chapel, who tells them that the doctors are clones from a Soviet genetics program and are being systematically killed by the Russian and U.S. governments. Mulder, Scully, and Chapel head to pick up another doctor named James Dickens, but Dickens flees at the sight of Chapel, who is really the disguised Bounty Hunter. Dickens is killed by the Bounty Hunter in the subsequent pursuit, unknowingly aided by Mulder and Scully. Scully doubts \"Chapel's\" credibility, but Mulder believes his story due to his credentials and experience. Scully performs an autopsy on Weiss and finds that his blood has coagulated, while his red blood cell count is excessively high. Scully finds an address on a bag recovered from Dickens' residence and heads there, discovering a lab that is in the process of being destroyed by \"Chapel.\" Meanwhile, Mulder is summoned to the home of his father, Bill, and learns that his sister Samantha has seemingly returned home after being abducted decades before. Samantha claims that she was returned around age nine with no memory, and recently recalled her experience through regression hypnosis. Samantha tells Mulder that the Bounty Hunter and the clones are actually aliens, and the Bounty Hunter will begin chasing her as soon as he has killed the remaining clones. Meanwhile, Scully heads to a hotel to hide from the Bounty Hunter. Returning to the lab, she finds four more clones, who claim to be the last. Scully arranges for them to be transported to a safe place, but the Bounty Hunter follows her and watches. At her hotel room, Scully lets in a man who seems to be Mulder, only to receive a phone call from the actual Mulder soon after."

        "content": "The episode opens with a Fox News Channel broadcast of Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), proclaiming his innocence. Six hours prior to this newscast, Lincoln is in the Cutback Motel room 11 in Montana, with his brother Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and ex-agent Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein). The policeman outside is beckoning Michael to leave the motel room and surrender. Kellerman cracks the door open, flashes his badge, and announces that he is with the FBI and will take the brothers to Billings. As Kellerman herds the brothers who seemingly have their hands bound behind their backs, the police officer demands to see Kellerman's identification. With that, the trio explodes into action, seizing a cameraman from the newscrew, commandeering a car, and driving away. Agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) returns to the FBI Field Office in Chicago, Illinois. Mahone asks for updates; in reply, Agents Lang (Barbara Eve Harris) and Wheeler (Jason Davis) inform him that Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) has been apprehended for the death of another CO, Roy Geary, and that C-Note's wife Kacee has been apprehended in North Dakota. Mahone scoffs in response, demanding updates concerning the Fox River Eight. Michael, Lincoln, and Kellerman are in a car, with their cameraman hostage still in tow. Michael asks Kellerman to stop at an abandoned warehouse and he complies. The trio discusses what to do, while the cameraman stares anxiously. At Fox River State Penitentiary, a battered and bloodied Brad Bellick wakes up in the infirmary. Trumpets (Anthony Fleming) is there, acting as an orderly. He informs Bellick that although the inmates won't kill him, they'll continue to hurt him badly. After telling Trumpets to leave, Nurse Katie Welch (DuShon Monique Brown) tells Bellick that he will be returning to the General Population tonight. Bellick is reluctant to leave the infirmary. Bellick's behavior, particularly around Nurse Katie, at the start of this episode intentionally mirrors that of Michael's when he was in the infirmary at Fox River. He stares longingly at the now-severed cable that the Fox River Eight used to escape, and asks Katie to \"leave the door open when she goes home\", a reference to Michael's request of Sara to leave the infirmary door open so that he and Lincoln could escape. In the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) sits in an old bus, heading for Ixtapa. Sucre befriends an elderly passenger (Ismael 'East' Carlo), who notices his Puerto Rican accent. When they arrive in Calomatillo, Sucre unsuccessfully tries to stay aboard the bus as he did not have a paying ticket. Sucre's newfound friend, the elderly passenger, invites Sucre to his home, providing that he can cook. Sucre agrees to this proposal, as he sees the elderly man's vehicle, a Volkswagen Beetle, as a way of getting to Ixtapa to see Maricruz. After they finish dinner and the elderly host had retired for the night, Sucre stole the car but is later stopped by the Mexican police. The widower tells the police that he is glad they found Sucre, as he forgot to give him gas money. The police let him go, as the widower tells Sucre to \"find your girl, then find grace\" (contrary to the subtitles, however, the elderly man actually said \"find the grace of God\"). In Algoma, Wisconsin, Haywire (Silas Weir Mitchell) is with his dog, a Border Collie he named Larry, while he digs in a dumpster. A teen couple approaches Haywire and asks him to buy them some beer. Haywire agrees, but wants to buy dog food as well. The guy offers Haywire some money to buy his own beer, but Haywire refuses, and replies \"My dad used to drink\". Haywire delivers the beer to the teens, and shows the girl, Sasha (Kaley Cuoco), the raft that he is trying to build. He tells her enthusiastically that he is trying to get to Holland with the raft. Sasha's friend Matt replies, \"Good luck, Gilligan.\" When Haywire notices bruises on Sasha's wrists, Sasha can only answer \"my dad drinks too\". Haywire follows Sasha to her home, where her father is about to beat her with a fireplace implement. The Fox River escapee attacks Sasha's father repeatedly upon entering. A Montana television station is stunned to see their missing cameraman back safely, holding a video cassette. In the Chicago FBI Field Office, Mahone demands that the roads in Montana be closed. As he makes demands, the office's attention is drawn to the television. Fox News is airing a video featuring Michael and Lincoln, where Lincoln declares his innocence. He further blames the murders on The Company, and explains their nature. Michael announces that Sara Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies) is innocent as well, and that FBI Agent Mahone has murdered Abruzzi, Tweener and also the missing Oscar Shales. As eyes around the office focus on Mahone, he announces that Michael is crazy. As this video airs, Agent William Kim (Reggie Lee) is watching as well. Turning to his subordinate, he demands \"Damage control immediately!\" When the subordinate reminds him that it is already on the air, Kim yells in reply, \"Start a wildfire in Florida! Find a lost storage unit full of Arabs! I do not care! As long as it's not about Lincoln Burrows!\" He later meets with the mysterious man who communicates with a notepad, and they agree that while the President is in danger, she has some expendability. Mahone is informed by a Montana FBI agent who interrogated the cameraman that the brothers mentioned driving to a location 450 miles away within six hours. Mahone comes to the conclusion that the brothers are headed toward Denver, Colorado, where President Caroline Reynolds (Patricia Wettig) will speak. Agent Wheeler interrupts Mahone's requests for information. When Mahone asks if Wheeler has a problem with the way he does things, Wheeler replies affirmatively and adds that \"I'm not the only one.\" He further informs Mahone that FBI Internal Affairs wants to be kept posted of Mahone's moves. Agent Mahone watches the Declaration of Innocence video with analysts who believe that Burrows is lying, based on subtle movements he makes. These subtle movements were actually orchestrated by Kellerman, who told the brothers that such movements would confuse the analyzers. \"Tell them you're the Green Lantern\", Kellerman flippantly told the brothers, \"but I know how they break down these tapes.\" The FBI analysts are transfixed on a Morse code message that Michael taps out with his hand (\"the water is warm\"), but Mahone knows that Michael is trying to throw them off the scent. It's when he and the analysts pay attention to Michael's apology to Sara that Mahone figures out that the message isn't a Declaration of Innocence at all, and the brothers aren't going after President Reynolds: they're going after Sara. He immediately demands that Sara's records, contacts and habits be analysed for clues. At the same time, Sara Tancredi watches the video of Michael and Lincoln from the Jewell Glore Library in Kansas City, Missouri, flipping through a book as she does. At Fox River, Mahone questions Nurse Katie, only to find no useful information. He attempts to question Bellick, who demands to be placed in Ad Seg. Mahone replies that he has no pull with the Department of Corrections, but the badly battered Bellick is adamant in his demand. Mahone agrees, and Bellick informs the Agent that the quotes used by Michael are chapter titles in the Alcoholics Anonymous book. By analysing the chapters in the book, Mahone quickly discovers that Michael is planning to rendezvous with Sara at the St. Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio. As Michael, Lincoln, and Kellerman drive, they hear on the radio how their news story is being sidelined due to a lost storage unit full of Arabs (which raises the Homeland Security Advisory System into Orange Alert). They then stand close to the hospital lobby, while Michael hears a page asking for \"Michael Crane\". This is an allusion to the origami cranes he made for her. Michael answers the call, and speaks with Sara for the first time since their meeting in Gila, New Mexico. Sara tells Michael that she couldn't get to his location in time, but Michael promises her that they can end this soon. While Michael talks to Sara, Kellerman receives a telephone call from the President, telling him that he is the only one that cares about her, and that he should return to her side, but without the brothers. Michael returns, and the trio return to their car. \"In a few days, this should all be over,\" Michael said. \"Absolutely.\" replied Kellerman. The episode ends with Kellerman's loyalties unclear."

In present-day Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau an academic under instructions from Magnus Martel is seen with the relic\u2014the Loculus\u2014researching on the ground to find the right place to hide it. Magnus' son Jake, an ace cryptographer, is released from Wormwood Scrubs and recruited by his father for research on the Loculus. Magnus reveals that the Loculus relates to the Knights Templar and its sinister successor organisation known as \"the order\", and in secret receives calls from this organisation threatening him if he does not accelerate his research, in spite of this, Magnus realises the Loculus' massive power for good or evil and has hidden it to ensure it does not fall into the order's hands. After breaking a code on the Loculus to reveal the word \"palingenesis,\u201d Jake hides whilst members of the organisation kill and flay his father. Jake then flees with another researcher on the project (the occultist Mira) and seeks help from the Roman Catholic priest Father Ray Connolly. The trail takes the three characters to (among others) a Cambridge library to research Isaac Newton's involvement in attempting to unlock the Loculus and to Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau and its Tour Magdala. They discover that the Loculus is related to Christian eschatology and has been hidden on Patmos, writing-place of the Book of Revelation. Father Connolly stays behind in London as backup while Mira and Jake go to Patmos and find the Loculus hidden in a crypt beneath a Greek Orthodox Church and former temple to Mary Magdalene as Aphrodite. Using the reflective properties of a hermaphrodite symbol on the Loculus they reveal a hexagram built into the floor, an occult symbol. Jake and Mira disrobe and make love within the symbol in an attempt to unlock it, experiencing a vision of themselves as Christ and Mary Magdalene before fleeing into the crypt when they hear a pursuer approaching. The pursuer turns out to in fact be Father Connolly and together they finally work out the Loculus' meaning\u2014its significance in fact lies in the four nails holding it together, which are those used to crucify Christ and retain organic matter with his DNA, preserved in a ceremony on Mount Hebron. The Templars and the order have continually attempted to use the DNA on it to resurrect Christ (including one failed attempt by Newton), but have failed until the genetic advances of the present day. The three argue as to what to do with the discovery\u2014Jake concurs with his dead father and wishes to destroy it to keep it out of the order's hands, whilst Ray wishes to take it to a trustworthy African cardinal at the Vatican. Ray prevails and traps the other two, but on arrival in Rome the order's Grand Master seizes the Loculus, puts Ray under torture and sends troops to kill Mira and Jake. The couple manage to flood the chambers with sand to kill the troops and the church's monks are alerted to the couple's plight by an emergency postcard sent by Connolly before his departure, but only Mira manages to escape\u2014Jake is fatally buried. In the meantime the Grand Master has cloned Christ and had him not only proclaimed the Messiah by the Vatican but put under his own tutelage and control, so that he can brutalize him and rule the world through him. The film closes with Mira realising that she (Magdalene's descendant) has given birth to a child by a Martel (Christ's descendant via the Merovingian dynasty) and that she must keep him secret from the order (as predicted by Revelation 12.4) so as to oppose the Grand Master's puppet Christ."

        "content": "The Nun starts out with a young woman, named Suzanne, in a wedding gown preparing to take her vows of chastity, obedience, and poverty to make herself a nun, but she refuses at the last moment and instead begs her parents not to force her to take them. This does not work, and later Suzanne learns much about her family and her heritage \u2013 or her lack thereof. She discovers that her mother's husband is not her father, and that her mother is shutting her up in the convent because she does not want her husband to know that the girl was not his daughter. She also does not want to see her sin in the flesh, for she says bearing the girl was her only sin. The father sends the priest to convince her, who reveals her heritage, but it fell on deaf ears. Later the mother falls on her knees to beg the daughter to take the vows, explaining the story enough to make Suzanne resign herself to her fate, realizing that her mother would never give her a chance to marry because the mother did not feel she was worthy to marry and the family could not afford to marry her off. According to the mother, she did not have the bloodline to marry. She writes her mother a letter that says she will take the vows, a letter that will later be used against her in the court case she wages against the church to be released of her vows. Suzanne allows herself to be dressed in a wedding gown and takes the vows. She enters the convent, extremely depressed and unresponsive, unable to cope with the requirements of being a nun. She bonds to the Mother Superior, who takes her under her wing, and they have many long conversations. The Mother Superior, Mme de Moni, knows it is a mistake to accept the girl as a nun but does not stop it, instead telling the girl to accept her fate and make the best of it. Suzanne attempts to, which is made easier by Mme de Moni's encouragement, and does not utter more words but her body language reveals all. During this time, Suzanne's mother dies, and Mme de Moni does as well. She bears it until the life finally drives her mad, for the new Mother Superior, Sister Sainte-Christine, mistreats her because of her rebellion as a result of her dislike of the nun's life. She isolates her constantly and deprives her of food, forcing her to adopt a diet of bread and water. Suzanne then sends her friend away with a letter to a lawyer. She wants to be free and absolved of her vows under the argument that everyone around her forced her to take the vows against her will: her mother, her father, the Mother Superior, etc. The lawyer, who becomes her biggest advocate against the religious orthodoxy enslaving her, informs her that while the case is pending, she will have to stay with Sister Sainte-Christine and endure the resulting persecution, but that either she will win or be transferred. Suzanne does not care, not truly understanding the depths of Sister Sainte-Christine' cruelty. While the case pends, Suzanne suffers many mistreatments under Sister Sainte-Christine, who steals her crucifix, forbids her to eat, forbids her to pray, forbids the other sisters to interact with or speak to her, and isolates her.  She allows them to walk on the weakened, starving Suzanne after Mass. She is also whipped. They become convinced she is possessed, and Sister Sainte-Christine requests an exorcist. Officials arrive, see her mistreatment and understand that her devotion to God is not the way a possessed person would act, and investigate the mistreatment, which involves Sister Sainte-Christine's being reprimanded. After that, Sister Sainte-Christine lessens the punishment to only isolation but still treats her coldly. When Suzanne discovers that the church has decided not to absolve her vows, she once again falls into a severe depression. Her lawyer apologizes and promises to keep in touch, although a church official forbids the contact. The same man later tells her that the church transferred her to another convent under the supervision of Mme de Chelles. In addition to long conversations about her thoughts and experiences, the light-hearted, fun, happy Mme de Chelles displays an attraction to and makes sexual advances towards Suzanne, which Suzanne never fully grasps. She meets a monk who attempts to comfort her by saying that he was forced into religion against his will as well. They develop a relationship and he later tells her that they must escape together. Suzanne goes with him, but flees from him when he forces kisses on her as soon as they are together which implies he desires more with her. Suzanne finds refuge nearby, working as a seamstress and doing chores for women. While there, she learns that the monk was caught and faces life in prison, same as she does. She cannot bear the thought of returning. She flees the small village she has taken refuge in and winds up begging on the street. A smart looking woman takes her to her home, but Suzanne does not understand it is a brothel and joins the girls who are dressing to entertain clients at a masked dinner party. As everybody takes their places, Suzanne realises what is involved. Crossing to the window, she asks God's forgiveness and jumps to her death."

        "content": "Due to its sensitive depictions of high-authority Catholic figures, the film was petitioned against by an outraged public ahead of its completion in 1965, as well as condemned by the Catholic church. The film was twice approved for release by the Censorship Board and both times blocked by the Minister of Information, Yvon Bourges, thus effectively banning the film temporarily from a theatrical release. Mention of the ban was itself banned on French TV. Elliott Stein, an American journalist living in Paris, reported in the British film magazine Sight and Sound that \u201cLe Monde ran a day-to-day feature, 'L\u2019Affaire de La Religieuse,\u2019 to which one opened as if to a daily horoscope or weather report\". Finally, in 1966, after a year of acrimony, the Minister of Culture Andr\u00e9 Malraux allowed \"La Religieuse\" to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim and a nomination for the Golden Palm Award. The praise allowed for a theatrical release in France, where it was met with much anticipation, despite earlier sentiment towards the subject matter.

        "content": "In 1928 England, David Ash (Aidan Quinn), an American professor, has spent a majority of his life working in the field of parapsychology to disprove the existence of ghosts. He was motivated by the untimely death of his twin sister, Juliet, for which he blames himself. As a professor at Oxford, he receives a series of urgent entreaties from a Ms. Webb, who claims she is being tormented by ghosts, to come and help her. David travels to Sussex, where he is picked up at the railway station by the beautiful Christina Mariell (Kate Beckinsale). Christina explains that Ms. Webb is in fact their Nanny Tess (Anna Massey), and that she wrote to David at the urging of the Mariell siblings, Christina, Robert and Simon. The siblings are concerned for her mental health and believe her belief in ghosts is due to her senility. She drives David to the palatial Edbrook House, where he meets Christina's two brothers and the withdrawn Nanny Tess. David begins to perform forensic examinations of the house, trying to detect evidence of paranormal activity. Complicating the investigation is Christina's continuous flirtation with David, and his own infatuation with her. However, older brother Robert (Anthony Andrews) is adamantly against their friendship and the two have a suspiciously close relationship. David himself begins having paranormal experiences. Christina, who had originally told David both her parents died in India, admits that in fact her mother drowned herself in the lake and Nanny Tess was the one who discovered the body. David postulates that it is the trauma of this which is causing Nanny Tess to see the ghost of Mrs. Mariell. When David decides to finally leave Edbrook, he asks Christina to come away with him. Although she refuses, they engage in a passionate kiss and end up in making love in her bed. In the morning when David wakes, the wind is gusting through the house, which is now cloaked in black drapes and littered with fallen leaves. He searches for Christina but instead sees the ghost of his twin sister Juliet, who leads David to a cemetery. Juliet calls his attention to a specific tombstone which states that Robert, Christina and Simon Mariell all died in a fire at Edbrook House in 1923. A very confused David seeks out Dr. Doyle (John Gielgud), the family doctor, only to be told by his sister's ghost that Doyle also had died many years ago. Despite his sister's warning, David leaves with Christina, who has appeared in her car. On the drive home, he sees the vision of his sister in the middle of the road and wrenches the wheel to avoid her. The car crashes into a tree and explodes, killing Christina. David escapes, returns to the house, and confronts Nanny Tess. She confirms that the Mariell siblings are indeed dead and that their ghosts will do anything to keep Nanny Tess and David from leaving. Nanny Tess also reveals that the reason Mrs. Mariell drowned herself was because she discovered drunken Simon and Robert in their parent's bed having incestuous sex with Christina. The siblings appear and force Nanny Tess to confess to their murder (she had locked the siblings in a bedroom and then set fire to the house). Robert reveals that, with David as the new victim of their torments, they no longer need Nanny Tess. They kill Nanny Tess, and Christina asks David to die for them. He tries to escape, but is blocked by the three siblings and Dr. Doyle. They set the mansion ablaze, but he escapes to the upstairs bedroom. While Robert, Simon and Christina cackle mockingly within the flames at his imminent death, Juliet suddenly appears and walks through the flames, takes David by the hand and rescues him from the inferno. As they walk away from the mansion's ruins, Juliet absolves him of his guilt over her death and departs to the afterlife. After the harrowing experience, David returns home and is greeted by his assistant, Kate, as he steps off the train. A few steps behind the unsuspecting couple, Christina steps out of the shadows and follows them through the fog as they leave the platform."

The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \"Revelations\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10, being watched by 15.25 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to positive reviews. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a case where fake stigmatics are being murdered. When a boy shows signs of being a real stigmatic, Mulder and Scully attempt to protect him, fearing that he will be the latest victim. \"Revelations\" became a minor storyline milestone for the series with the exploration of Scully's faith as a Roman Catholic. Throughout the remainder of the series, her Catholic faith served as a cornerstone, although at times a contradiction to her otherwise rigid skepticism of the paranormal. Furthermore, while Mulder is usually the believer and Scully is usually the skeptic, \"Revelations\" features a role reversal with Scully becoming the believer and Mulder becoming the skeptic, a move that Duchovny called \"a refreshing change of pace.\""

Afterwards, Reverend Findley is visited by a white-haired man named Simon Gates, who strangles him\u2014his hands smoking while he does so. Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate the case. Mulder says that the minister was the eleventh fake stigmatic who has been killed over the past three years in a series of international murders. Meanwhile, at an elementary school in Loveland, Ohio, a boy, Kevin Kryder starts bleeding from the palms of his hands. The agents arrive and meet with a social worker, who claims that Kevin has suffered injuries before and that his father was institutionalized, adding that Kevin was in danger from evil forces. The agents visit Kevin's father, who claims that his son is the chosen one and that evil forces will come to kill him as part of a great war \"between good and evil\". Kevin is abducted by a strange-looking bald man. Kevin's mother recognizes the man's description as that of Owen Jarvis (Michael Berryman), who had done yard work for the family in the past. Owen claims to be Kevin's guardian angel. As the agents arrive, Kevin mysteriously disappears. Owen claims he was asked by God to protect Kevin and criticizes Scully for her faith not being as strong as his. Owen jumps out the window and escapes. Kevin arrives at his home and is pursued by Gates, who kills Owen when he arrives to protect Kevin. Scully performs an autopsy and finds that Owen's corpse is not decaying, reminding her of \"incorruptibles\" that she learned about in Catechism. Mulder tells Scully to not let her faith cloud her judgment. Scully finds that handprints on Owen's neck belong to Simon Gates, a rich and powerful executive. Kevin travels with his mother in a car which breaks down. Gates arrives offering to help fix the car, and Kevin, who appears in two places at once, is able to distract him and help them escape. However, Kevin's mother - becoming faint after being hurt by Gates - runs the car into a ditch and dies as a result. Scully tells Kevin she'll protect him. They bring him to a hotel where Scully notices an additional wound on Kevin's side. Scully becomes upset that Mulder will not even consider that a miracle is possible. As they talk, Gates breaks into the bathroom, kidnapping Kevin by prying an opening in the barred window. Scully returns to see Kevin's father but finds him heavily drugged. Scully theorizes that Gates has brought Kevin to a recycling plant he owns in Jerusalem, Ohio. Mulder thinks that he has headed to the airport, as a man matching Gates' description was reported headed there. Mulder thinks Scully believes that she's been chosen to protect Kevin. Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder and is killed. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye; Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to confession for the first time in six years, admitting that she was raised a Catholic but has drifted away from the Church since then.  She admits to being unsettled by the things she has witnessed, and even more unsettled by the fact that Mulder, usually the more credulous of the two of them, has not seen them.  The priest advises her \"Sometimes we must come full circle to find the truth\" (unconsciously echoing the recycling symbol Scully has seen several times earlier in the episode) and ask her if she is starting to doubt her own judgment.  Scully says that mostly it makes her afraid: that if miracles really do occur, then that means \"God is speaking... but that no one's listening.\""

Nutter decided that, after the episode, he wished to pursue different things and that the series was in excellent hands with fellow directors Rob Bowman and Kim Manners. Actor Kenneth Welsh, who appears in the episode as the demonic Simon Gates, had previously portrayed a chief antagonist in the critically acclaimed 1990 serial drama Twin Peaks, alongside Duchovny. The episode contains a role reversal with Dana Scully the believer and Fox Mulder the skeptic, which David Duchovny called \"a refreshing change of pace.\" Nutter believed that by examining faith, the show's creators were able to explore the nuances and seeming contradictions of Scully and her worldview. The episode was the first to discuss Scully's faith in-depth. Series creator Chris Carter later emphasized that the theme of the episode was more on personal belief rather than organized religion, noting, \"[The episode] deals with faith, not religion with a capital 'R' or Catholicism with a capital 'C'\". The producers for the series were cautious about presenting an overtly religious episode of the series for fear of \"pissing certain people off\", but, according to Carter, the show \"handled it in such a way as to make it about miracle belief, or lack of belief.\" According to co-producer Paul Rabwin, the episode had been rewritten a number of times, even when it was already in production. The producers felt it was difficult \"to sell the concept of religious magic\" (for instance, bi-locating). The episode went through a detailed editing process, which including additional tweaks to the script. These changes required actor Kevin Zegers to fly back to Vancouver and film reshoots and additional scenes. The producers claimed to be in awe by the way the episode turned out after all the additional work had been done. Several of the scenes were altered or cut during post-production, such as the scene with the priest; the producers were unhappy with the voice of the actor, so they recorded a voice-over and mixed it in during post-production. A scene with Kevin's father speaking in tongues, quoting the famous \"Klaatu barada nikto\" line from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), was cut in the final edit of the episode."

Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim. Worried by the events, the hospital coordinator, Dr. Theresa Shannon, tells Mulder and Scully about a similar series of deaths that occurred at the same hospital ten years prior. They suspect Rebecca Waite (O-Lan Jones), a nurse who is the only person present at all the death scenes. The agents visit Waite's house, discovering evidence that she practices witchcraft; however, the audience learns that the evidence was planted there by a staff member of the hospital. Elsewhere, Dr. Jack Franklin (Richard Beymer) is non-fatally assaulted by Waite at his house. There, Waite is arrested and approached by the agents, who attempt to question Waite but are prevented when she starts to vomit pins, dying shortly thereafter. After the incident, Mulder visits Dr. Jack Franklin, hoping to learn more about Waite's possible motivation. Although Franklin is seemingly innocent, when Mulder leaves the room, he begins to levitate and devilishly smile. Later that night, Mulder deduces that the birthdays of all the victims match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath and that Waite was actually trying to protect the victims from Dr. Jack Franklin (she had placed the pentagramsactually protective symbolson and around the victims in the hopes of protecting them from dark magic). This also explains why Waite tried to kill Franklin. Unfortunately, Mulder also realizes that because Waite was not the murderer, the spree of murders will continue. And as he suspected, another patient is murdered with acid back at the hospital. Soon after, the agents again meet with Dr. Theresa Shannon, and she further discusses the spree of murders that occurred ten years ago. According to Shannon, five people were killed at the clinic: four patients and a cosmetic doctor named Clifford Cox, who ostensibly died of a drug overdose. Although his birthday does not align with a Sabbath date, Mulder instinctively believes that Cox is involved in the crimes. Mulder then uses the hospital's computer program to determine what Cox would look like had he undergone heavy plastic surgery. The computer produces an image that looks like Franklin, suggesting that he is actually Dr. Clifford Cox in disguise. When Dr. Shannon discovers Franklin alone in a blood-spattered operating room, he uses witchcraft to magically teleport surgical tools into her intestines, which causes her to bleed internally. Dr. Shannon is rushed into surgery and survives. Meanwhile, Franklin removes the skin of his face, performing a ritual to make him appear younger and escapes. It is implied that he murders in a quest to gain eternal youth. The episode ends with a now-younger Franklin successfully applying for a position at another medical hospital."

        "content": "In the 1990s, the television industry made wide use of spec scripts, solicited from freelance writers. While The X-Files had a large staff of writers, the staff would occasionally have to take a risk on a teleplay written by an unaffiliated writer to fill out a full season order. \"Sanguinarium\" was such a case, being written by sisters Vivian and Valerie Mayhew. This marked their first experience with writing a one-hour network program, and they would later write several episodes in the television series Charmed. Prior to having their script picked up by the series, the sisters asked staff writers Glen Morgan and James Wong for writing suggestions. Morgan and Wong told them that \"the scariest things are those which repeat every day\". Soon thereafter, Vivian was paged by a number she did not recognize. She realized that pagers in their own way are scary, because an unknown person can connect to the pager's owner. The Mayhews then went from focusing on pagers to the group of people who normally use them: doctors. It was then that they realized a plot about doctors losing control and being bewitched could make for a good episode. After writing their spec script, they presented it to Morgan and Wong, who suggested they change the villain from a woman to a man as \"plastic surgery is related to vanity, and everyone expects that from a woman, but not a man.\" After the script was submitted, it was selected to become a full episode. After the spec script was picked up, series creator Chris Carter and the show's staff reworked it into a teleplay. Carter focused much of the plot on the themes of greed and vanity, and executive producer Howard Gordon developed several graphic scenes. After Carter had the idea of placing a subtle pentagram on the reunion table, production designer Graeme Murray decided to take this further by creating rooms with five sides, and having the plastic surgery unit with five operating rooms represent an imaginary pentagram. Like previous episode \"Home\", Fox Standards and Practices objected to the graphical content, and Carter had to intervene to help retain some scenes. Given its subject matter, the episode features many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally named after a friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed because there was a real nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider\u2013Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails to Fox regarding the portrayal of their beliefs."

In the process he meets an attractive girl called Mich\u00e8le, who supports his plan, and the two end up shut inside the Brussels Motor Show for the night. His next idea is to approach a client of the salon, a rich older woman who has a Porsche, and try to charm it from her. Finding her at a catwalk show of bikinis, she takes him into her car and fellates him. Abandoning that line of attack, he learns that he cannot rent a car because he is too young and then he fails to steal one in the street. When telling Mich\u00e8le that all avenues seem closed, his boss returns and says he can have the Porsche for the weekend after all. At the hotel by the starting line, he finds they can only afford one room, so he disguises himself as a girl and goes up with Mich\u00e8le. They talk late and fall asleep on the bed.

Factory boy Al Manning (Wallace Ford) hopes to marry her, but Marian is determined to find a better life. When a train makes a stop in town, Marian looks through the windows and sees the wealthy passengers. She then makes the acquaintance of one of the train passengers, Wally Stuart (Richard \"Skeets\" Gallagher), a New Yorker who gives her champagne and writes down his address, telling her to look him up if she ever makes it to New York. Marian, now tipsy from the champagne, happily returns home. Giggling, she tells Al and her mother that she was drinking down by the railroad tracks. Al, who was waiting for her and accuses her of being drunk, spots the piece of paper containing Wally's address in Marian's hand, grabs it from her, and tears it up. He then tells Marian that her actions are inappropriate and that she's staying with him. Marian lashes out, telling Al and her mother that no one owns her and that her life belongs to herself. She grabs the torn paper shreds up from the floor and pastes them back together, then leaves for New York City. There, she looks up Wally who gives her some advice on meeting and keeping wealthy men, which Marian uses to begin a relationship with his friend Mark Whitney (Clark Gable), a divorced attorney. She eventually becomes Mark's mistress and he provides her with a complete make-over, educating her in the arts and culture of his social set. Three years pass and the two entertain with brio and style. Marian and Mark fall in love. To cover the fact of Marian being his kept woman, Mark devises a made-up back story of her being \"Mrs. Moreland\", a wealthy divorcee living comfortably off her alimony. Some time later, Al, now running a prosperous cement business, comes to the city hoping to land a big contract. He sees Marian and asks her to marry him, but she refuses. When Al learns that Marian is friends with Mark, Al hopes he can use Mark to help land that contract. Al has no idea of Marian and Mark's true relationship. When Mark decides to run for gubernatorial office, however, friends caution him that his relationship with Marian is a serious liability. When she overhears Mark talking with some politicians, she learns that he now plans to marry her, despite the fact that their relationship would cause a scandal. To support his gubernatorial bid, she lies to Mark, telling him that she no longer loves him. She tells him that she is going to marry Al instead. Marian decides to tell Al the truth. He rebuffs her, saying that he could never marry such a woman. He changes his mind when he realizes that in shutting her out of his life, he is also burning his bridges with Mark and that highway contract. A political rival learns of Marian's true identity and plans to leak that information at one of Mark's political rallies. At that rally, Mark has the crowd generally on his side. No one is aware that Marian is in the audience. His political rivals then drop shards of paper from the auditorium ceiling, each piece of paper with the text, \"Who is Mrs. Moreland?\" written on it. Seeing that text on the paper, Mark has a worried look on his face, he not knowing what to do. As the crowd rumbles, Marian steps up from the audience and tells them that she is Mrs. Moreland, and that Mark has always been an honorable man, who once belonged to her, but now belongs to them. The crowd cheers as she, sobbing, leaves. Outside, Mark catches up to her and tells her that from now on they will be together no matter what. Mark legitimizes their relationship by proposing marriage."

Along the way, he helps American Catholic priest Oliver Van Horne, who has a flat tire. However, when Keogh reaches his destination, the man he was to deliver the cargo to is dead, killed by Colonel Santilla's men. The men are also about to have their way with a mute Aymara Indian woman named Chela. When Keogh tries to stop them, they hang him. Van Horne shows up just in time and proceeds to kill Santilla's men with a machine gun. Van Horne, Keogh and Chela flee, but are caught. After subjecting Keogh, Van Horne and Jennings (who was smuggling arms, not whiskey) to a mock execution by firing squad, Santilla offers to spare them if they will assassinate Tomas de la Plata, who lives in a well-protected region with his mother. He offers them equal shares of $53,000, found in Van Horne's suitcase. Santilla has already wrangled an invitation for Keogh and Jennings, posing as mining company employees, as de la Plata is anxious to reopen a silver mine. On the way, Keogh is reunited with Chela, who gives him a necklace. Unbeknownst to Keogh, the Aymara are a matriarchal society, and women choose their husbands; they are now married. De la Plata, however, hates priests, and several have been killed in the town of Mojada, which is under his control. He spares Van Horne once at his religious mother's insistence, but forbids him to perform any priestly functions. Van Horne sets about cleaning the church, assisted by choirboy Pablito. Keogh and Jennings pretend to inspect the mine, while Van Horne comes along to bless it. There is a cave-in, and the three men rescue Senora de la Plata and several miners. Van Horne defiantly declares that he will hold a mass the next morning to lure de la Plata into an ambush, but when Senora de la Plata shows up for the mass, he aborts his plan. Once again, Senora de la Plata shields him from de la Plata's hatred. It is revealed that de la Plata's father was brutally murdered and his sister and mother violated by Santilla's men, while the corrupt local priest stood by and did nothing. Van Horne tries again, announcing that he will hold a procession at 9 am the next morning. He also tells the townspeople he will perform marriages and baptisms and hear confessions that night, hoping that they will be grateful enough to join the trio into taking up arms against de la Plata. (It turns out that Van Horne actually was a priest, and a devoted one at that, until a corrupt bishop embittered him.) The next morning, some of de la Plata's men are killed, but their leader is only wounded. He takes hostages, including Chela and Pablito, and threatens to shoot them, one by one, until Van Horne comes to him. Jurado, de la Plata's second in command, brings Pablito into Mojada and shoots him down in cold blood before Van Horne's eyes. Van Horne, who was about to flee, changes his mind and gives himself up. He manages to kill someone he thinks is de la Plata, but it is only a double. However, Keogh and several Aymara men sneak in; the Irishman blasts the main entrance with grenades, weakening the doors enough for Jennings to drive Van Horne's car through them. The townspeople follow. In the ensuing fight, Jennings blows himself and Jurado up with a grenade. De la Plata is about to kill Keogh, when he is shot by his own mother. He stumbles out and collapses near the stone cross Van Horne has been tied to. Van Horne manages to topple the cross onto de la Plata, killing him."

He does not find the debtor so he rapes the debtor's wife Haruko while her husband and young son Takashi hide secretly in the closet. The husband later gets drunk during the daytime and gets into a fight with some street thugs who beat him to death. His older son Hideshi encounters them and kills one of the thugs by stomping on his skull. 30 years later in Kyoto a hired killer shoots three men protecting Iwaida in a lift. The aging Iwaida, now head of the Mutsumi Group, recognizes him by a scar on his left cheek before he is shot dead by the killer. A nurse witnesses the killing but the killer lets her live. Two men later question Mr. Yoshikawa, a witness who saw the nurse on the roof at the time the murder of Iwaida was committed, but they gain no information. They manage to get an image of the killer's scar from the camera footage and identify him as \"Lightning Takeshi\", the most famous killer in Japan. While driving to a crime family meeting in Yokohama, the wealthy criminal Hideshi Miwa notices another vehicle with a Kyoto license plate following him and has security at his house beefed up by his man Kono. The host calls the meeting to order and first hears from the Kanto Block. The woman running the block, Hisako, says that things are set up so that the newspapers and TV stations will be on top of the matter of corruption within the Ministry of International Trade and Industry when the time is right. The host then calls upon Omaeda of the Osaka-Kobe block to speak. After that Hideshi explains that profits are 10% less than in the previous year but he is expecting counterfeit money from the Philippines, which will mean a total of 360 billion yen for the family. Finally, Omaeda announces that the secret code word name of the organization, \"Japan Mafia\", has been leaked to the outside. Hideshi explains that there is either a traitor in their midst or else someone from another group deliberately leaked the code word from negotiations. After the meeting, Hisako shows Hideshi a photo of the killer with the scar that the Mutsumi Group is distributing around Tokyo. Hideshi recognizes the killer as his younger brother Takeshi but feels that Iwaida needed to die. Hideshi asks if the boss asked for his younger brother to killer Iwaida and Hisako admits that he did because Iwaida was a thorn in the side of the crime family. Even though they could crush the Mutsumi Group, the boss wishes to avoid an all-out war so Hisako asks Hideshi to find his brother before the killer goes into hiding. She also asks if he would like to have sex with her but he merely leaves. Hideshi's younger brother Takashi is also an underboss in the crime family. He and Hideshi visit their mother at a care home but she is suffering from Alzheimer's and claims not to know anyone named Takeshi. The nurses recall that Takeshi visited earlier in the month, the day before the murder of Iwaida, and that he would not be able to come back for a while so he made arrangements to have money sent to her but did not leave any address. Hideshi and Takashi split up, with Hideshi searching Kyoto and Takashi combing Kobe and Osaka. At the police station Detective Kakuta questions the nurse Rie Ishibashi. She denies that the man in the photograph is the killer, claiming that the killer did not have any scar on his cheek. One of the men searching for Takeshi bribes Detective Kakuta at a pachinko parlor. Katuka gives Rie Ishibashi's name and explains that no one called for a nurse. Takeshi tracks down the girl working as an escort role-playing a nurse. Takashi speaks with Hatanaka at Rakuhoku University, a fellow student of Takeshi's from his study of medicine, who says that Takeshi spoke with him two days after the murder. At that time Takeshi said that he was cursed and that his enemies were watching all of the roads and flights, preventing him from leaving the city, but when he ran out of money he planned on hitting the headquarters with guns blazing to die a noble death. He then says that he spoke with Takeshi again earlier that morning, when Takeshi said that he had been reunited with the love of his life, his \"angel in white\", and was leaving Kyoto with her. Takashi receives a call from Kenmochi, head of the Mutsumi group, who has kidnapped Takashi's wife Mariko and demands that he hand over \"Lightning Takeshi\" before the week is over. Takashi drives through the gates of their headquarters with a tank so Kenmochi quickly rapes Mariko while he has time. Takashi and Hideshi beat up Kenmochi's men and find Mariko as she is being raped by one of the henchmen, whom Takashi shoots. Takashi and Hideshi meet with their boss, who explains that Kenmochi has leaked photos to the police of Takashi and Hideshi from the murder. He asks if they have found Takeshi. Takashi says that they have. He plays Hideshi a phone message he received from Hatanaka saying that Takeshi contacted him and told him that he was in Nagano. They hide Mariko with Mr. Shao, a Chinese friend living in Chinatown. Mariko grew up in China and feels close to him. He agrees to take in Takashi as well so Hideshi leaves Takashi and Mariko with Mr. Shao to seek out Takeshi alone."

        "content": "In 1925, Jimmy \"Dodge\" Connelly (George Clooney) is captain of the Duluth Bulldogs, a struggling professional American football team.  Dodge is determined to save both his team and pro football in general when the players lose their sponsor and the league is on the brink of collapse. He convinces Princeton University's college football star, Carter \"the Bullet\" Rutherford, to join the Bulldogs, hoping to capitalize on Carter's fame as a decorated hero of the First World War (like Alvin York, he single-handedly captured a large group of German soldiers).  In addition to his legendary tales of combat heroism, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed and skill on the field.  As a result of his presence, both the Bulldogs and pro football in general begin to prosper. Chicago Tribune newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton becomes the object of the affections of both Dodge and Carter. Lexie has been assigned to find proof that Carter's war heroics are bogus. Carter confesses that the surrender of the Germans was a lucky accident and that his role in it was more foolish than heroic. Carter soon discovers Lexie's agenda and is doubly hurt when he learns that Dodge and Lexie are starting to show affections for each other and even shared a kiss. The ensuing fight over Lexie's affections puts her off. Spurred on by the threats of Carter's manager, she decides to publish the story. The story sparks a firestorm of accusations and reprimands. Carter's manager resorts to shady dealing to cover it up, even bribing the original witness to change his story. Dodge's attempts to legitimize pro football take on a life of their own. The new commissioner of football appointed by the US Congress, formalizes the game's rules, taking away improvisational antics. In addition, the commissioner takes the responsibility of clearing up the Carter controversy to set an example for the new direction of professional football. With the whole world against Lexie (even the Tribune is pushing her to retract her story), Dodge concocts a clever ruse. Interrupting a private hearing in the commissioner's office, Dodge threatens Carter with a confrontation by his old army mates. Dodge claims that they are just outside the door, ready to congratulate him for his heroic actions. In truth, the men are Bulldogs in borrowed Army uniforms. Carter confesses the truth. The commissioner frees Lexie from printing a retraction. Carter is ordered to simply say he got too much credit for his war actions, but must give a hefty part of his paycheck to the American Legion. Carter's conniving manager is banned from football as well. Dodge is warned that if he pulls any old tricks to win the next game, he will lose his place in the league. Dodge plays in one last game. This time it will be against Carter, who has changed sides from Duluth to Chicago. The rivalry for Lexie's affection spills onto the field. The game does not go well for Dodge, including how muddy the field is. Dodge decides football should be played without rules. Lexie notices that after a brawl, Dodge is missing and with most players covered in mud, no one can tell who is who. There appears to be an interception and Chicago seems to have won, but when the mud is removed it is seen that the player is none other than Dodge Connelly, who disguised himself as a Chicago player on the play. The play is changed from an interception to a touchdown, and the Bulldogs win. Carter tells Dodge that Dodge is finished playing football, based on the threat the commissioner had made. He intends to tell the newspapers the real story about his \"capture\" of the German soldiers. Dodge argues that America \"needs\" heroes and it is implied the true story will not be told. Dodge and Carter part on good terms once again. After the game, Dodge meets up with Lexie and they ride into the sunset on Dodge's motorbike, discussing with humor the possibilities in their future, which include bankruptcy, scandals and jail time.  During the end credits, pictures show Dodge and Lexie getting married, Carter donating $10,000 to the US military and Carter's former manager with new clients Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig."

In a title sequence shot by Maurice Binder, a chorus of Spanish Flamenco dancers explains why the film's location is Greece rather than Spain. Life on the remote Greek resort island of Karos is forever changed when atomic bombs are dropped there by a NATO plane rapidly losing power.  Life on the island is so bleak that the inhabitants stage a mass exodus on news that Denmark has opened Greenland to Greek emigration.  The pilots drop their payload \u2013 which includes two atomic weapons and a mysterious box called simply \"Container Q\" \u2013 over land, because they are under orders not to drop at sea.  The hapless pilots parachute out and land safely on the island, but with no equipment or means to contact their headquarters, and they are left wearing only their underwear.  Lacking resources \u2013 money to buy clothes, food, or even to pay for a long-distance call to base \u2013 the pilot and navigator of the lost bomber scour the island like vagabonds.  Unknown to the pilots, the Americans have already deployed their own operation: a team of agents disguised as resort developers.  The pilots are unaware of the fact that American agents are also on the island searching for their cargo. The island suddenly fills with clamoring, hedonistic tourists who believe the developer is going to build the best resort in the area first.  Meanwhile, a poor goatherd and his wife find Container Q and, presuming it holds some treasure, they try to open it.  Unsuccessful at first \u2013 because Container Q is virtually impregnable \u2013 the goatherd eventually steals a device that sprays acid that will eat through anything.  Expecting gold, he and his wife instead find strange-looking rocks.  The Americans are eventually led back to the panicked pair, but not before they throw Container Q into the sea, and the rocks into a cistern which provides the island's water.  The contents of Container Q \u2013 presumably highly toxic \u2013 thus begins to contaminate all the water being consumed on the island. By nightfall, as tourists revel, the waters surrounding Karos become dotted with the bodies of dead and dying fish.  The Americans sent to recover the lost payload of the stricken jet realize that they are too late.  The pilot and the navigator, having begged enough small change from the tourists to call home, are shocked to be booted from the long-distance phone in the post office by the American developers.  Too late, the pilots realize that the developers are American operatives.  The revelers continue dancing wildly as a voice from a PA system pleads in vain for their attention, presumably to warn them of their imminent demise."

Ten years later, Parker is living in comfortable retirement in Spain. Four Spanish youths kidnap him and deliver him to British hit man Braddock and his sidekick Myron, hired by the kingpin that Parker helped put away. In the course of the kidnapping the youths run down a Spanish policeman who has been assigned to guard Parker. Three of the youths are then killed by a bomb in a briefcase, which they believe to contain their pay-off, handed to them by Braddock. Braddock is a world-weary professional killer while Myron is his perky but volatile young apprentice. Parker quickly adopts a carefree demeanour, later explaining that he's had ten years to accept death as a simple part of life. Braddock, who has the key to an apartment in Madrid where the owner is away, orders Myron to drive there but when the three walk in they find the place occupied by an acquaintance of the owner. He is Harry, a middle-aged Australian with a young apparently non-English speaking Spanish girlfriend Maggie, who comes home as they are talking. Parker mischievously announces his identity to them, causing Braddock to take the girl with them as insurance. Harry gives them the keys to the owner's white Mercedes which is brought to the underground garage where the group leave their previous car. As they are about to start Parker makes a comment that causes Braddock to doubt that Harry will keep quiet and he goes back up to the flat and kills him. The group head toward the French border intending to reach Paris, where the kingpin against whom Parker testified is apparently awaiting their arrival. All the while, Parker sows seeds of discord between the two hit men. The Spanish police, led by senior inspector, follow quite closely the trail of bodies. Stopping at a roadside bar to buy beers, Myron is laughed at by four youths, so he attacks them and then runs for the car. Myron has developed sympathy for Maggie and feels protective of her. Braddock himself has a confrontation with her when they are alone in which she reveals she understands English and also bites his hand, drawing blood, from which he appears to derive some form of masochistic or self-penitential gratification. Braddock drives up a track leading to a wood by a river where they can rest up. Leaving Myron with Parker he takes Maggie with him to get petrol for the car. Maggie tries to alert the station attendant to her plight, allowing in Braddock to kill the young man. Braddock chases after the girl but is unable or unwilling to shoot her. They return to find Myron has fallen asleep and allowed Parker to slip away. Braddock finds him gazing at a waterfall and confronts him about his lack of concern over his impending death. Parker reminds Braddock that death is inevitable for all and quotes John Donne's poem \"Death Be Not Proud\". The next day, with ten miles to the border, Braddock stops the car at an isolated hillside and announces that he's scrapped the plans to go to Paris. He relieves Myron of his gun and flings it into the scrub. Suddenly afraid, Parker insists that he can't die until he gets to Paris. Braddock shoots him in the back as he flees. He then turns the pistol on Myron and kills him. Maggie surprises him and they wrestle violently. During the struggle, Braddock fires the last shot into the air and knocks Maggie unconscious. He leaves her alive and drives to a secluded spot where he changes into hiking clothes and walks off through the forest. The police find Maggie and the two bodies. As Braddock attempts to cross the border on foot, Maggie identifies him to the police, who shoot him dead as he tries to escape. The police attempt to question the dying Braddock but he only winks at Maggie before he dies."

When Ir\u00e8ne's elderly lover gets drunk and falls asleep on her birthday, she goes to the hotel bar, where she assumes the barman is absent and Jean is a millionaire guest. Rather than correcting her, he makes her several impressive cocktails and they then retire, tipsy, to the hotel's Imperial suite where they spend the night together. In the morning, Jean awakens to find Ir\u00e8ne has gone. A year later, Ir\u00e8ne returns to the hotel with Jacques, who asks her to marry him. Ir\u00e8ne is surprised to see Jean, and he manages to conceal his occupation from her again. Jean and Ir\u00e8ne sleep together again, but Jacques sees them and breaks off the engagement. Ir\u00e8ne goes to Jean, pretending she gave up Jacques to be with him, but as they lie in bed together, they are discovered by guests and staff in the Imperial suite. When Ir\u00e8ne discovers who Jean really is, she walks out. However, Jean is now in love and follows her, finding her at the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Pursuing her, he spends all the money to his name to pay for her presence, including his savings and pension plan, until he uses his final euro for \"10 more seconds\" to look into her eyes. Ir\u00e8ne leaves him for another rich man, and Jean is left with a hotel bill he cannot pay. Luckily, Jean is picked up by a wealthy widow, Madeleine, who pays his bills in exchange for his companionship. Ir\u00e8ne bumps into him again with another lover, Gilles. She is a little jealous, but now that they are \"equals\", she teaches Jean the tricks of gold-digging. Using her advice, he soon wheedles a \u20ac30,000 watch from Madeleine, after she forced him to have plastic surgery on his ear. On a shopping spree, Ir\u00e8ne meets up with Jean and coyly offers him the euro for \"10 more seconds\". Jean continues to prove himself a skillful gold digger. He and Ir\u00e8ne steal away from their patrons every chance they can, falling in love in the process. On the morning of Ir\u00e8ne's departure for Venice, Gilles catches Ir\u00e8ne and Jean kissing on the hotel room balcony. Furious, Gilles leaves Ir\u00e8ne at the hotel with nothing but a sarong and the swimsuit she is wearing. Jean sells his watch to buy Ir\u00e8ne a week's stay in their hotel and a gorgeous evening gown. He also gives her an invitation to a party. Madeleine is at first upset with Jean for selling his watch, but Jean calms her down by giving her a pair of earrings. He claims that he pawned the watch to buy Madeleine a gift and she is pleased. At the party that evening, Ir\u00e8ne sees Jacques again, but with a new young girlfriend, Agn\u00e8s. While stealing a dance with Jean, Ir\u00e8ne hatches a plan to win Jacques back again, with Jean's assistance. Jean agrees to play along and is dumped by Madeleine in the process. However, he convinces Agn\u00e8s that he is a prince and seduces her away from Jacques, giving Ir\u00e8ne a chance to steal Jacques. However, when Ir\u00e8ne sees Jean with Agn\u00e8s on the balcony, she realizes she loves Jean. She runs away from Jacques and declares her love, abandoning her pursuit of a luxurious lifestyle.

Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 72 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". After its March 2008 premiere in the United States, Stephen Holden called the film an \"amusing ball of fluff that refuses to judge its characters\u2019 amoral high jinks\";  he calls it a \"shrewdly cast\" film \"winking at the vanity of wealthy voluptuaries and hustlers playing games of tainted love.\"  According to Holden, the film is \"too frivolous even to be called satire.\"  According to Mick LaSalle, what makes the film \"fun\" is \"the harshness wrapped in a pretty package. The movie stars Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh, who are about the only French stars that it's almost impossible to imagine having an active sex life. Their aura of innocence helps. Still, in America, no director could ever make this movie, even with the most innocent-seeming actors on the planet. This is way European, folks, not meant for our eyes, and, of course, that's the whole kick.\" LaSalle notes the following: \"Priceless is an entertaining sex farce that takes its characters to some of best hotels and most exclusive restaurants in France, and to watch it is to marvel at how some people live - and how you don't. But here's the interesting thing: Through this seduction, Priceless turns the viewer into a harlot, too, who can suddenly understand why Irene would do anything and sleep with anybody just to stay in this lifestyle. Likewise, we understand\u2014instinctively, without thinking about it or judging it\u2014why Jean might start sleeping with an older rich woman, just so he can stay in the hotels where Irene stays. Would you want to be the person who orders the drinks or fetches the drinks? How easy would it be to go back to normal life after confirming what you never really wanted to know, that the rich really do have it better, as in a lot better, as in money really does buy happiness?  So Priceless is silly, but it's not so silly. It's pretty to look at, often very funny, but it corrupts its audience as it corrupts its characters.\"     In a one-star review () upon the film's June 2008 release in the United Kingdom, Peter Bradshaw call the film a \"gruesomely unfunny and tacky comedy-farce\" and notes \"the whole movie slavers over bling, and has a nasty, dated air of pseudo-worldliness and ersatz sophistication. With its luxury-tourist locations, it is basically vulgar, and not in a good way, and reminded me of the opening title sequence to the 70s TV show The Persuaders!, but without that programme's charm.\""

        "content": "Donnie Rose (Rossif Sutherland) plays a former boxer who is released from prison after serving time for a vicious assault on a Black teen that left the teen physically and mentally disabled. The beating of the teen sparked outrage and further divided the historically segregated city of Halifax. Upon his release from prison, he is surprised by a hero's  'welcome home' party at his brother Keith Rose's ( Greg Bryk) house and other members of the White community in Halifax. While at the party Donnie is confronted by the victim's father George Carvery (Danny Glover) who is holding a gun contemplating shooting Donnie to avenge the assault of his son. After a tense, heated exchange between George and Keith who is wielding a baseball bat, Donnie tells George \"Just do what you came here to do\" . After contemplating for a few moments George returns to his car and drives back to his mostly African Nova Scotian North End Halifax- area home. At this time, we get the first glance at his family, his wife Ruth Carvery (Tonya Williams) and his mentally and physically challenged son Charles (K. C. Collins). The condition of Charles has an obvious strain on their marriage, as just the sight of Charles condition forces them to come to grips that he will never again lead a 'normal life'. The release of Donnie from prison is much to the chagrin of members of the Black community in Halifax. Ossie Parris (Flex Alexander) a famous boxing champion challenges Donnie to a fight in the hopes of seeking retribution for the vicious attack that left Charles disabled, offer him $20,000 to participate in the prize fight. Knowing that Ossie will use the opportunity to murder Donnie in the ring, George offers to train Donnie in order from keeping him from being killed. Later in the movie members of the Black community attempt to enter a night club which has an unofficial policy of not allowing Blacks to enter. The clubs security force which is headed by Keith, Donnie and other members of the White community, refuse entry to the Black would be party goers. A fight at the club's entrance ensues with gunfire breaking out and a car being lit on fire (the scene is to resemble the Halifax race riot in 1991 in which over 150 Black and White clashed outside a downtown Halifax bar, after Black men were continually being denied entry in local bar establishments due to their race). Looking for further retribution Keith's crew burned down the Black community church. Members of Ossie's crew then kidnap and savagely beat Keith to death, leaving him at the same location where the beating of Charles took place years earlier. Donnie then goes to the Halifax Black Baptist Church during Sunday congregation to kill the culprits, but then leaves the church, instead deciding to turn in the suspects. Days before the fight Donnie and George meet at the same place where both their loved ones suffered brutal attacks, and they share a deep moment that put the film in perspective. George explains that he has a resenting hate in heart from all his years of struggle, and tells Donnie that he has the same hate in his heart and he must let it go. It is then that it was revealed that it was, in fact Keith that brutally beat Charles, and that he only confessed because he was a minor and would have served less time than his brother. On fight night Donnie enters the ring to a chorus of boos from the crowd. The fight goes back and forth between both fighters landing decisive blows. With George and his family in attendance, Charles suffers an 'episode' and climbs in the ring, causing an already agitated crowd to throw chairs and enter the ring themselves. A riot breaks out in which both Ossie and Donnie fight off crazed fight fans. The fight is subsequently forfeited and Donnie hangs up his gloves to symbolize the giving up of his hate."

Thorne recalled, \" It got me thinking about race- and race in Halifax.\"[1]\"That was the original inspiration for (the story).\"[1] Years later in 1999 Thorne writes a play called Poor Boys Game, which centers around race, revenge, and forgiveness. While working in Toronto as a struggling actor, Thorne screenplay was chosen for one of the six finalists for Toronto International Film Festival Pitch This competition. Although he doesn't win, panel judge Ralph Zimmerman (who was Clement Virgo agent) suggest he meet with Virgo to discuss developing the screenplay for the big screen. By the autumn of 2005, the script is completed after 17 drafts. Virgo and his business partner at Conquering Lion Damon D' Oliveira fly to L.A to meet with Danny Glover to star in the film. Glover's commitment to the lead role is enough to trigger financing from Telefilm, the Nova Scotia Film Development Corporation, Ontario Media Development Corporation and The Movie Network. In the spring of 2006, Virgo begins casting for the movie and auditions over 100 actors to play the role of Donnie Rose. He later chooses Rossif Sutherland -half-brother of Kiefer Sutherland- which many though a risky move since Sutherland was virtually unknown at the time. However, Virgo justified his choice in Sutherland believing that he could cast a young actor will be able to tell the story. Adding to the controversy of casting Sutherland, is that he is 20 pounds overweight months before the shooting of the film. However, he gets into fighting trim, by converting the 20 pounds of fat to muscle. While filming the movie in the summer of 2006, Virgo only has three days to cover the climatic boxing sequence, which he calls the \"most daunting aspect of the film.\""

Cargill willingly admits his guilt and brings forth evidence that proves that he signed a germ-warfare confession and broadcast anti-American speeches over the radio, seemingly an act of treason. It seems to be an open-and-shut case, were it not for Cargill's inexplicable refusal to defend himself. Arousing further suspicion is the fact that his collaboration immediately followed the deaths of two of his soldiers, and the unit's survivors all recite an identical, rehearsed account of those deaths. Edwards' commander, General Connors (Carl Benton Reid), has a strong personal interest\u2014his son, Captain Joe Connors (Yale Wexler), was one of those who died\u2014and presses Edwards to recommend a court-martial, but Edwards delves into the mystery, refusing to accept the facile explanations. In the end, the shocking truth comes out. Lieutenant George Miller (Rip Torn) reveals that, after Lieutenant Harvey (Manning Ross) was killed trying to escape, the rest of the men discovered that, under torture, Captain Connors had betrayed him. Over Cargill's strong objections, they decided to execute Connors. Drawing the short straw, Miller strangled him. Subsequently, their captor, Colonel Kim (Khigh Dhiegh), gave Cargill an ultimatum: give in, or all his men would be executed. He agreed to collaborate to save their lives. General Connors calls his son a traitor. Cargill argues with him, stating that there must be a time limit on being a hero.  He denounces the Uniform Code of Military Justice espoused by General Connors for demanding too much from soldiers, but the general reminds him that, while Cargill anguished over the lives and families of 16 men, many commanders had to anguish over the effect of their orders on the lives and families of thousands. Edwards agrees with General Connors that although Cargill acted out of a humane selflessness, Cargill's judgment was flawed. He recommends that all charges be dropped, but warns Cargill that there will be a court-martial. Edwards himself will defend Cargill.  Maybe they won't come up with all the answers, Edwards tells him, but \"they'll know we asked the questions.\""

However, one night, Anne awakens to discover a masked intruder in her room. Terrified, Anne tries to escape, but the intruder chloroforms her into unconsciousness, rendering her helpless as he kidnaps her and takes her to an isolated house. In the morning, Anne finds herself held captive by a couple named Frank (Vincent Gallo) and Helen (Jennifer Tilly). Helen has gone mad after her baby was aborted by Frank upon learning that it would have been born deformed. The procedure left her sterile, and he is now attempting to make it up to her by giving her Anne's baby. Anne recognizes Frank as a technician at her fertility clinic, and Helen later tells her that he secretly replaced her fertilized egg with one of Helen's instead. Frank stages a car accident with a horribly burned body to make everyone believe Anne is dead; Jack refuses to accept it and pressures the police to continue investigating, but after several months they dismiss his ideas. After dealing with several escape attempts, Frank finds himself frustrated both with Helen's bipolar insanity and her refusal to have sex with him while she is \"pregnant\", and he attempts to force himself on Anne before being interrupted by Helen. Frank chases Anne outdoors while Helen terrorizes a diaper service saleswoman. Subsequently, Frank attempts a forcible amniocentesis, against Helen's wishes, and during the argument he lets it slip that he never switched her eggs. Helen snaps; she kills, dismembers, and cooks Frank's body. Her increasing madness leads her to threaten Anne with a caesarean section, and Anne finally manages to escape. She calls Jack from a nearby phone booth, but Helen runs it down with her truck in the middle of the call. Although she chases and shoots at Anne, Anne cuts her face with broken glass and runs, collapsing on the roadside where she is found by a local teenager. The police still refuse to believe Jack's story, even after seeing the damage to the phone booth, so Jack travels to the house Anne described, only to be ambushed by Helen with a baseball bat. Helen then kills a nurse at the hospital and again kidnaps Anne to force her into having the baby. Helen decides to allow her to have a natural birth rather than a C-section, but Anne manages to break free, and after a violent struggle she wraps one of her chains around Helen's neck and strangles her. Helen rises up for one final shot but misses and dies. As the police take Helen's body away, Anne emerges from the house with Jack and her new baby."

They have two children: Ramir\u00edn and \u00c1ngela. One winter day, Luisa, stopping in a traffic light, spots her ex-husband, \u00c1ngel, who is selling tissues on the streets. After that brief encounter, the next day, Luisa looks for \u00c1ngel in the area where she saw him before. She finds him wandering about the city in destitution. Overcome with sentimentality and, over Ramiro's objections, Luisa takes \u00c1ngel into her home in an effort to help him and rebuild the friendship the three of them once had. Luisa is convinced that destiny has reunited them. Luisa, \u00c1ngel and Ramiro were three inseparable friends in their childhood and youth. Once they became adults, they formed an uneasy love triangle in which the two men were rivals for Luisa's affection. Luisa married \u00c1ngel, but two years later, she left him to marry Ramiro, who she thought was the one she was mean to be with. Ramiro is not pleased to see again his former friend who by now he wishfully presumed to be dead. Unwillingly, he accepts \u00c1ngel's presence. He thought \u00c1ngel was working in construction living a prosperous life in South America. However, after his divorce from Luisa's, \u00c1ngel spent all his money in a restless life. He reappears after more than ten years of absence, broke and ill. \u00c1ngel still loves Luisa and has never overcome his feelings of resentment about their divorce. He still wears the ring she gave him in their first and only wedding anniversary. The ring has the inscription: P.R.E.O.M. that stands for: To be reunited in the other world (). Initially overwhelmed by Luisa's mystical and deranged streak, \u00c1ngel tries to leave but \u00c1ngela brings him back home. He has fits, foaming, and blood in the mouth. Medical results show that he is terminally ill. Soon, Ramiro and \u00c1ngel shift from friends to enemies and have a bitter confrontation. Luisa is torn between them. She loves \u00c1ngel as a part of herself, but also loves her husband and beyond reason, wants to have them both. \u00c1ngel establishes a friendship with the couple's little children, Ramirin and \u00c1ngela. The girl is more sympathetic and the boy, always taking his father side, is a little hostile. \u00c1ngel spellbinds them both with his offbeat stories and his directness. He takes them to a short trip to the beach where he reenacts with them a scene from his own childhood. He sees in the children the reflection of his own youth and his erstwhile friendship with Luisa and Ramiro. While \u00c1ngel is at the beach, Ramiro and Luisa find out that \u00c1ngel is terminally ill and has very little time to live. Ramiro hopes he can wait out \u00c1ngel's declining health, while Luisa does not accept the medical verdict. As \u00c1ngel's health worsens, Luisa insists upon caring for him in the house rather than sending him off to a hospital. He is soon bedridden and in constant pain. Luisa makes love to him, and when she returns to Ramiro in their bedroom, she has sex with her husband. She loves them both intensely and equally. When \u00c1ngel  condition worsens, he falls into coma, Luisa, alone through force of will brings him back to life to the astonishment of her husband and children. She takes \u00c1ngel to bed, and in spite of his illness makes love to him. She does not deceive her husband, she tells him so right after. Ramiro takes the information with resignation knowing that the end is near for his rival. When \u00c1ngel is at death's door, Ramiro prepares a lethal doze of anesthetic to accelerate his death. In the final moment, the dying man makes a final, desperate bid to steal his ex-wife away from her new spouse. He grasps the hypodermic needle with its overdose of anesthetic and kills Ramiro. Dragging himself to his rival's marital bed, \u00c1ngel dies next to Luisa. Luisa then takes a ring with P.R.E.O.M. written on the inside from her dresser and puts it on the now dead Ramiro, to bring the two ex-friends and rivals together in the after life.  Luisa and the children follow two funeral cars to the cemetery, both coffins have written: to be reunited in the other world."

A devastating nuclear war that contaminated the northern hemisphere was preceded by a standoff between the United States and China after the latter blockaded and later invaded Taiwan. Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing, partly regarding an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere. The submarine is sent to investigate, with Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown), and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) on board. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him irreversibly sick with radiation poisoning. Upon reaching Alaska, Towers and his executive officer go ashore to find no survivors. Entering a house and seeing a dead family huddled on a bed, Towers thinks of his own family and what they must have endured. The source of the automated digital broadcast is traced to a television station whose broadcast, Towers and his executive officer discover, comes from a solar-powered laptop trying to broadcast a documentary via satellite. While in Alaska, Towers' executive officer accidentally rips his suit and hides the fact that he is becoming sicker and sicker. Upon the Charleston's return to Melbourne, he collapses and is diagnosed with terminal radiation sickness. Towers attends his old friend in his dying days and ultimately, at his request, euthanizes the man as his deteriorating condition causes him to experience extreme suffering. Towers returns to Melbourne, where a woman in whom he has become interested, Moira Davidson (Rachel Ward), Holmes's sister-in-law and Osborne's ex-wife, is waiting for him. As the people of Melbourne realize that the inevitable nuclear cloud will soon reach their location, their impending doom begins to unravel the social fabric; anarchy and chaos erupt. Some choose to live their final weeks recklessly in a deadly car race while others seek a more peaceful means to face the end of their lives. Holmes and his wife Mary (Jacqueline McKenzie) find solace in their love for each other as Towers and Moira become closer. When radiation sickness appears in Melbourne, people begin lining up for government-issued suicide pills. After Mary and their small daughter Jenny fall ill, Peter and his family share a final moment before taking their doses together, Peter sorrowfully injecting his child. Osborne races around the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit and finally crashes his car at Turn 10, resulting in a fiery death. With most of the Charleston's crew members developing advanced radiation sickness, they ask to take the submarine on one final voyage to San Francisco. Though they know they are unlikely to survive the trip, they wish to die together on the Charleston, the only real home they have left. Towers agrees, apparently abandoning Moira to be with his men. As Moira, about to take her own suicide pill, watches the Charleston sail away, she is joined by Towers after all."

Though Johnny is upset on never getting recognised legally as a son, he decides to help his father by clearing his loans. Johnny, a fan of singer Archana, never misses her concerts, which is also noticed by Archana. A romance develops between the two, but neither expresses it. Vidyasagar, a barber, lives in a bungalow away from the city. Once when he returns home after getting drunk and losing control, he is helped by Bhama, a homeless orphan. When Bhama requests him to employ her for domestic work, he relents. Bhama, slightly greedy and indecisive, always aspires for better things in life. However, her beauty and innocence makes Vidyasagar fall in love with her. He protects and cares for her and buys her new clothes. Johnny cons a businessman, who files a police complaint. When he sees Vidyasagar at a salon, he mistakes him for Johnny and calls the police. The commissioner investigates the case along with the superintendent. Since Vidyasagar was in the salon when the theft took place, the commissioner believes the thief is someone else. The police start hunting for Johnny and also monitor Vidyasagar. Johnny's friend visits the salon and mistakes Vidyasagar for Johnny. Upon realising Vidyasagar is another man, he brings Johnny to meet him. Learning of the troubles Vidyasagar is facing because of his crimes, Johnny visits Vidyasagar and reveals himself as the culprit. To protect Vidyasagar from the police, Johnny tells him to remain home for 10 days so that he can resolve all issues and come clean. Archana expresses her love for Johnny, but he hesitates to reciprocate due to his background. When Archana misunderstands his hesitation, thinking he is doubting her integrity and character, Johnny confesses his love and seeks time to settle a few things before marrying her. Johnny eventually settles all his father's loans, but is shocked when his father dies after knowing his son settled his loans. Vidyasagar notices Bhama with another man. When questioned, she says she shares a sibling-like relationship with him. Vidyasagar proposes to her and assures he will take good care of her. However, Bhama looks down at his profession and feels it would be embarrassing for her children. Though hurt, Vidyasagar tries to explain things to her and gives her time to decide. However, Bhama hurriedly tries to escape with the man at night. Vidyasagar stops and kills them. Witnesses inform the police, who assume it is Johnny's work and search for him, also for pending cases against him. Vidyasagar, aware that Johnny is wanted, tries to foist the murder charge on him, and Johnny goes into hiding. When Vidyasagar learns from Johnny's friend about Archana's love and her affluence, he decides to impersonate Johnny and goes to Archana's house. When Archana explains that she compensated Johnny's victims at the cost of her wealth, Vidyasagar is disappointed. Archana, hurt by \"Johnny's\" curtness, is confused about his change in taste and behaviour. Though Vidyasagar had come with plans to win her and grab her wealth, her character and love for Johnny stop him, and he reveals his true identity. He assures her that Johnny will be back soon and advises her to perform one last concert (which she had cancelled after Johnny got into trouble) so that Johnny will return. Johnny sees an advertisement for Archana's concert and decides to attend. On the scheduled day, heavy rain occurs and no one attends. However, Archana still comes to the venue and sings. The police suspect her decision and wait at the venue. Johnny arrives at the venue, accepts responsibility for all the frauds and murders, and is arrested by the police. But Archana realises that it is actually Vidyasagar posing as Johnny. Archana gets upset when the real Johnny does not arrive. Just before she leaves the venue, Johnny reaches, meets her and understands all that transpired. They reunite."

As the producer could not provide the equipment and facilities for the climax scene with a song, Mahendran was forced to use stock shots and manage to shoot with the limited facilities offered, but managed to mix the close-up shots with stock shot, and the scene came properly. This was the first time for which popular artist Jayaraj designed the costumes. He first drew the illustrations of scenes with costumes and then got them stitched, bringing in newness and style in Rajinikanth's look, which attracted the masses. The scene where Archana (Sridevi) proposes to Johnny was shot in Ooty in a bungalow at midnight. When the scene was shot, the whole unit was silent, they saw only the characters of the film, not Rajinikanth and Sridevi. After the scene was shot, Rajinikanth appreciated Sridevi's acting and mentioned to Mahendran that though he tried, she overshadowed him in the scene. Because Rajinikanth played two roles, he was billed twice in the opening credits, as \"Rajinikanth and Rajinikanth\". To play Vidyasagar, Rajinikanth sported a centre-parted hairstyle and wore box-framed glasses."

        "content": "Parma, 1962. Fabrizio (Francesco Barilli) a young student, struggles with reconciling middle class life with his interest in the militant views of the Italian Communist Party. He has a serious discussion his best friend Agostino (Allen Midgette) who tells him of his hatred for his parents' way of life. He is caught between relying on the Catholicism of his parents and the Marxist ideas touted by Fabrizio. Fabrizio is shocked when he learns of Agostino's drowning in the Po River. He interviews local youths who were there when it happened and becomes convinced that Agostino committed suicide. Fabrizio imagines that his friend's hatred for his parents was really hatred of himself. His despair causes him to break up with his girlfriend Clelia (Cristina Pariset), an apolitical, but pretty girl from a respectable family who he associates with the middle class life he's now desperate to avoid. His sudden restlessness causes his parents to invite his mother's beautiful younger sister Gina (Adriana Asti) from Milan to stay with family. After some discussion about death and the meaning of life, Fabrizio and Gina begin a passionate sexual relationship. Fabrizio introduces Gina to his former teacher Cesare (Morando Morandini), who is responsible for his interest in Communism. They read from various philosophical works and reflect on Italy's fascist past. Later Fabrizio runs into Gina coming out of a hotel with a man she met in the street. After harshly confronting her, Fabrizio leaves angrily. Gina sobs on the phone to her psychoanalyst about her inability to sleep and her constant anxieties. Although we only hear her side of the conversation, it's clear she has had some serious mental health issues. It is implied that her trip to Parma was suggested by her therapist to help her get away from problems at home. Fabrizio tries to distract himself by going to the movies with a friend who waxes poetic about how morality can be expressed through camera angles. Fabrizio and Gina spend the day with Puck (Cecrope Barilli), an old lover and friend of Gina's who has been living off land owned by his father his entire life and has never held a job. He is unashamed because he's a creature of habit. This strikes a chord in Fabrizio (jealous of Gina and Puck's intimacy) who lashes out at Puck. Gina slaps him for being rude to her friend. Fabrizio realizes that Puck is himself in 30 years. Children of the bourgeoisie cannot ever escape their past. Gina returns to Milan shortly thereafter. Left alone, Fabrizio becomes more conscious of his own weaknesses and his inability to realize his aspirations and political ambitions. He finally disavows the Communism revolution and chooses to go along with what is expected of him. He vows to forget politics and his Aunt Gina and marries his former girlfriend Clelia."

The names of the characters in the film are the same as those in Stendhal's novel La Chartreuse de Parme: the principal character and narrator, Fabrice, is now Fabrizio del Dongo, a young Marxist from a bourgeois family, who attracts his young aunt, Gina, now Gina Sanseverina, and finally marries a girl from a good family, Cl\u00e9lia, now Clelia Conti. Bertolucci said of the context of the film in a 1996 interview: The film, strongly influenced by the French New Wave, was shot between September and November 1963. The shooting took place in Parma and its surroundings, one scene being filmed in the camera ottica (optical chamber) at the Sanvitale Fortress in Fontanellato."

        "content": "The film is set against the landscape of two potentially related murders: that of an engaged woman in the inner-western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, and that of seven passengers on a Melbourne train. From there, the film deals primarily with the experiences of Lavinia Smart, a young woman who boarded the train shortly after the murders, and police Constable Graham McGahan, who is afflicted with increasingly severe tinnitus. When he requests light duty on account of his tinnitus, Constable McGahan is assigned the night shift of a police information van in Sunshine, where he encounters the traumatized members of the local community, including Lucky Phil, a mentally handicapped man, and Dean Stouritis, the dead woman's fianc\u00e9. At the same time, the film explores the fear Lavinia experiences after the horrific events she witnessed.  Although she escapes with her life, the police are dissatisfied with her statements and accuse her of holding back information.  Lavinia is further traumatized when she realizes that the killer has stolen a portrait that can be used to identify her.  The police try to reassure her of her safety, but a man she identified in a police lineup easily tracks her down and tries to intimidate her.  After Lavinia angrily confronts him and explains her situation, he apologizes and gives her a ride back to her house. After McGahan dismisses the concerns of Craig Finlay, a profane racist, Finlay ambushes McGahan and opens fire on the van with a shotgun.  Finlay also kills a passing motorist while hunting McGahan, who escapes through a window.  The crashed car's horn cancels out McGahan's tinnitus, and he hears Finlay approaching him.  McGahan kills Finlay, though he is shot and wounded.  After he rescues a baby from the car, McGahan collapses, and the film leaves his ultimate fate unresolved."

        "content": "The episode begins with the death of Michael John Piper, whose wife is a psychic. As he dies, Mrs. Piper states that she can see a light emanating from above his head. Nate begins to experience muscular twitching and loss of verbal skills, which after some internet research David determines to be a condition known as AVM.  Later, as Mrs. Piper is selecting a casket for the funeral assisted by David, she informs him that she is being advised by her late husband. In a scene in the kitchen, Ruth comes downstairs and informs Nate, David and Claire that she will be attending a self-improvement seminar called \"The Plan\". Her friend Robbie had urged her to attend the course. Claire is worried that \"The Plan\" is some kind of cult, and Nate remarks that it must be \"one of those self-actualization things from the '70s where they yell at you for twelve hours and don't let you go to the bathroom\".  Upon arrival at the seminar, the leader begins to use jargon and metaphor which compares a \"blueprint\" for home renovation to self-improvement of one's life.  She singles out Ruth and berates her for \"tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up\". Claire attends a counseling session at school, and David brings Nate to the Independent Funeral Directors lunch, where Nate proceeds to rant about the evils of corporations as related to their industry.  Claire later returns to the counselor's office, where a police detective questions her about her boyfriend Gabe's involvement in a convenience store robbery, and Claire is angry with her counselor for breaking their trust.  Brenda and Nate have a conversation about college-life while she is selecting courses for her adult education, and the conversation leads to Brenda's current lack of interest in sex.  Brenda later decides to leave the genetics class she had enrolled in, after getting in a public argument with the instructor. Ruth comes home late at night from her seminar, and finds Claire waiting for her on the couch. Ruth mentions that she will be attending more seminars of \"The Plan\" because she has already paid for the coursework and does not want to appear rude. Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversation with Claire, and then Ruth complains that she cannot yet go to sleep for she must first do \"homework\" from the course.  This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for \"all the terrible things she did to me\", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will \"renovate\" her life.  As Nate prepares for the funeral, his father Nathaniel visits him, and they discuss philosophical opinions regarding death and the afterlife.  A poem by Walt Whitman is read aloud at the funeral.   After the funeral Claire requests assistance from Nate, but David interrupts them with follow-up news from their Independent Funeral Directors meeting.  Keith and his mother have a heated discussion about the care of Taylor, and the neglected responsibilities of his sister Carla.  Brenda flirts with a patron at a bar, and he gives her his business card moments before Nate arrives to meet her. At \"The Plan\", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to \"renovate their homes\" together.  Robbie goads Ruth into calling a family member, but she fakes a conversation with Claire while listening to an automated message.  Later, Gabe calls Claire, and asks her to come meet him. Nate and Brenda have dinner together, where she tells him of her academic experience and he discusses concepts of death with her.  In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke.  Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for \"knocking down her old house\", and proceeds to tell her that now she can rebuild a new house.  Ruth and Robbie then hang out at a bar where they flirt and Ruth asserts herself in conversation.  While driving Gabe, Claire witnesses him shoot at another car while they are stopped, but does not see if he has hit anyone.  Claire later grabs Gabe's gun, and leaves him to go seek help from Keith.  Keith questions Claire in a supportive tone, while Nate and David are more concerned.  However, Keith explains to them that Claire was conflicted due to her love for Gabe."

She writes that: \"..the series performs the logic of self-help, both its silly and seductive sides\".  However, she also points out that Ruth's rant at the end of her seminar is cathartic for Ruth, and she ends her analysis of the episode by asking: \"So, what do we make of our times when all this supposed nonsense actually works?\" Donald Kummings cites the episode in his A Companion to Walt Whitman, while analyzing the effect of a poem by Walt Whitman on a grieving family.  Walt Whitman had been character Michael John Piper's favorite poet.  Kummings notes \"The facial expression of the bereaved wife indicates that she is pleased and consoled by these lines\".  Kummings also makes mention of the psychic theme that runs throughout the episode, noting: \"Indeed psychic connection with the dead is an ongoing motif here, since both funeral director brothers communicate with their father during the episode\".  The episode is also analyzed in Marriner's Finding the Open Road: A Guide to Self-construction Rather Than Mass Production."

When the family patriarch, Pancho Duque, is offered a lucrative but questionable deal by his bitter adversaries, the Samuels, he is faced with a difficult choice: Should he cash out of the sugar business and focus solely on rum, which would please his biological son, Frank Duque? Or should he protect the family legacy that he built from the ground up by refusing to sell? This would involve siding with his son-in-law, Alex Vega, who despises the Samuels and foresees multibillion-dollar profits from future ethanol contracts. Alex and Frank's approaches to business are as different as their approaches to life. While Frank focuses on chasing women, Alex is devoted to his beautiful wife, Isabel Vega. Married to him when she was just 17 years old, Isabel chooses not to involve herself in the family business, focusing instead on raising their three children, who are determined to forge their own paths outside the family. Will family allegiance come first or will their secrets and acrimonious conflicts over love, lust, and money lead to their downfall?"

The firm sends Orla, a local veterinarian, to inspect the cows and ensure the experiment is running smoothly. While performing a palpation, Orla is seemingly bitten by the unborn calf. She informs John, a genetic scientist from the firm, but he dismisses her concerns. John also informs Dan of a caravan parked near his farm and reminds him that the experiment is supposed to be kept secret from the public. Dan goes out and speaks to the inhabitants, traveller Jamie and his girlfriend Mary, and tells them they must leave by morning. That same night, one of the cows goes into labour, but Dan is unable to pull the calf out. Desperate, he goes back to the caravan and asks Jamie for help. Together, they successfully birth the calf. When Dan inspects the calf, it bites him. As thanks for their help, Dan allows Jamie and Mary, who are on the run from her brothers who disapprove of her relationship with a traveller, to stay on his farm. The next day, Orla returns to inspect the calf and Dan tells her that it bit him. She inspects its mouth and is shocked to find it has fangs. When Orla decides to terminate the calf, its mother aggressively comes to its defence and she is forced to kill them both. She performs an autopsy on the calf and discovers that it was somehow pregnant. She finds six foetuses, all of which are extremely deformed and have their skeletons growing outside their bodies. Dan and Orla argue and fail to notice when one of the foetuses escapes. The next morning, while feeding one of the cows, Jamie notices several strange wounds on its lower body. When he passes through some shallow water in the barn, something bites him. Shortly after, a police officer arrives at the farm and informs Dan that Orla is missing and her car has been found abandoned nearby. Dan searches his farm and finds her jacket, but no sign of Orla herself. Later that night, John returns to check on the experiments and learns about the malformed foetuses. While inspecting them, he discovers that their cells are multiplying extremely quickly. Inside their caravan, Mary notices unusual behaviour from Jamie as they have sex. They are later awoken by a creature crawling in their bed, but it escapes. John informs them that the entire farm must be quarantined as the creature can infect other cows and cause a pandemic. They begin searching for the creature but find that it is hiding in the murky water that is flooding the farm. Dan attempts to force it out of hiding with his tractor, but instead finds Orla's body in the water. John takes her body to the lab and finds foreign material inside a wound on her abdomen. The material displays the same extreme cell growth from before, but now also containing human cells. He realises that humans are also susceptible to infection. Jamie, realising he is infected, attempts to escape, but John kills him. When Dan and Mary come outside to investigate, they find that John has killed almost every cow on the farm in search of the creature. He explains that the creature has been hiding inside the cows like a parasite, eating them from the inside and growing larger. They go to the barn where the final cow is being kept, but find that the calf has already been born and escaped. A violent arguments breaks out between Dan and John. Mary flees when she sees John murder Dan. John chases her but is attacked and killed by the creature. While attempting to escape, she runs into Dan, who survived the earlier fight with John. They continue searching for the creature and the missing calf. They spot something moving under the floorboards and Mary goes down to investigate. She finds the calf just as new creatures begin rupturing out of its body. She kills it and the newborn creatures. The growing creature from the first calf then appears and attacks her, but Dan creates noise to lure it away. He allows the creature to attack him, creating an opening for Mary to injure the creature with boiling water. The wounded creature flees but Mary chases it down and kills it. She attempts to take Dan with her to find help, but he refuses due to being infected. He dies from his injuries while Mary leaves the farm. Four months later, in Birmingham, England, a pregnant Mary is assured by her doctor that her baby is healthy. When the ultrasound monitor is shown, a creature-like shape is briefly seen inside the foetus."

His ship passes the Statue of Liberty to enter the New York Harbor, then he makes his way to his hometown of Podunk. The narrator explains that Snafu, the town's \"returning hero\", feels \"safe at home, away from battle\". He also feels safe in discussing military matters with civilians, including restricted information. He starts by talking to his family and girlfriend (a blonde) over dinner. Describing the recent activities of his unit, the 999th division, and their co-operation with the British Army. He keeps offering information to others while wandering around town. He describes to a police officer the construction details of a secret base and its runway. A crowd gathers round to listen to him. While at a filling station, Snafu tries to impress the female attendant by sharing information on the new Japanese tanks. At a movie theater, a newsreel reports that one of the Japanese islands was obliterated, that the event is attributed to an American secret weapon, and that Hideki Tojo doesn't know what hit him. Among the audience of the movie theater is Snafu, seated next to an attractive brunette. Trying to impress the lady, he shares information on said secret weapon: a flying bazooka. His detailed information is featured as a schematic diagram. While drinking at a bar, Snafu reveals information concerning the next planned move against the enemy forces. A mimeograph is depicted printing said information. In a park, Snafu is making out with a young woman behind a bush. He takes the time to describe operations of the Pacific War. The \"confidential\" information makes it to an electric billboard. At a barber shop, Snafu receives a haircut and a manicure. He can not resist sharing military information with the barber and the manicurist. The narrator makes the point that skywriting the information would be no more effective in making it public. The final scene starts at Snafu's home, where he and his girlfriend dance the jitterbug. A radio announcement informs them of the latest news from the War Department. The entire 999th division has been annihilated by enemy forces, and the military disaster is blamed on \"recent leaks in restricted military information\". Snafu is enraged that some jerk \"shot his mouth off\" and now his division is gone. He wishes for the unknown jerk to be run over by a tram. In response, a tram passes through the living room and runs over Snafu, ending the short."

        "title": "Going Home (1944 film)_Release",
        "content": "Completed by May or June 1944, Going Home was never released. The rationale behind the decision is unknown, though there are several theories on the subject: The scene depicting Snafu and the girl laying (and presumably making out) in the bushes was deemed too sexually suggestive by the standards of the time; a later scene shows the pair dancing, and a flash of the girl's panties can be seen. The Snafu series was in a transition phase and that the short was too reminiscent of earlier entries. Originally the intended audience of the series consisted of raw recruits which required training in the basics of military life. By the summer of 1944, the target audience had changed, as the military personnel of the United States included millions of combat veterans. To better reflect this audience, the characterization of Snafu changed from an incompetent soldier to one more experienced and efficient. The portrayal of the United States home front was too negative. In other entries of the series, leaked information reaches the enemy through the services of spies; here, this information somehow reaches the enemy when released to American civilians. In other words, the civilians are the conduit which transmits the information and undermines the military effort. The finale featured a joke about the annihilation of a military unit, which was hardly likely to entertain a military audience. The secret weapon, able to obliterate entire islands, was deemed a bit too close in nature to an actual military secret: the atomic bomb."

Elgin first sees Caroline (Susan Dey) during a meal. After the meal, Elgin and Shelly separate from David and his girlfriend, ending up in his room.  Shelly declares that she likes Elgin and offers to make love to him. When she disrobes, he is shocked and spurns her advances. In a later scene, Elgin is working as the busboy at the school's cafeteria. There, he has his first conversation with Caroline but ends up spilling tea on her and her book.  She still leaves her dormitory name on a sheet of paper and he goes to see her with a new copy of the book.  After a rough start, she agrees to go and have coffee with him.  She alludes to having another boyfriend, but he is smitten and decides to join a class she is in, three weeks after it had started.  After talking to Caroline, Elgin learns that her father had died a long time ago.  They go on their first real date to the symphony and the chemistry between them becomes clear. Caroline introduces Elgin to the other man, John (Robert Loggia), who is already married.  She is visibly shaken by this meeting and asks to spend a night with Elgin, because she doesn't want to be alone.  Their love making is interrupted by David who says Elgin is late for work.  Elgin runs to work and David convinces Caroline to take a ride back to her dorm on his motorcycle.  Elgin spots them together and he fights David in a jealous rage; but feels better when Caroline tells him that she's not interested in David.  Elgin gets fired for being late to work. David and Caroline watch Elgin while he plays a successful game of soccer.  Elgin and Caroline were making love again when he asks about John (Robert Loggia), who worked with her father as a lawyer, and whom she had known all her life. He gets jealous after he learns that she slept with John, but Caroline gets mad about the entire conversation.  Elgin gets nervous when he can't get hold of her, but finds a note which tells him to join her, alone, at her family's estate.  Elgin meets Caroline and they pick up where they left off, but she resists him while they are in her childhood playhouse.  She told him that this is the place where her father committed suicide.  The phone rings before they drive together back to school.  During the drive, Caroline tells him that it was John on the phone. Carolin explains that John wants her back, and they can't see each other any more.  Elgin pulls his motorcycle out from the back of the car and leaves her on the side of the road alone in the car.  Elgin returns to his dorm to find Shelly sitting by his door. Shelly declares her love for David, but thinks he doesn't feel the same.  Elgin turns Shelly down for sex a second time. Elgin runs into Caroline saying goodbye to John. She told Elgin that she's with John and it's over between them.  Elgin gets drunk and again finds Shelly at his door.  Elgin accepts Shelly's third proposition; but she leaves in the middle of their tryst when he calls her Caroline.  Elgin goes to Caroline's shared class, but leaves in the middle of the lecture when she doesn't show up.  Elgin then goes to see John at his office.  He professes his love to Caroline and asks John if his intentions are honorable.  John says he has a shaky marriage, but his kids are important and doesn't know if he can divorce his wife.  Caroline shows up in Elgin's room in the middle of the night, makes love to him, and then brings him breakfast in the morning.  John decides he won't get the divorce, but Elgin is mad that he's second best. Elgin runs into David at school and he tells him that he and Shelly are engaged. Elgin takes Caroline back, despite this fact.  This eventually tears him up inside and he tells Caroline his love for her is gone and their relationship is over. He says goodbye to her as she leaves him alone on a train.  He is shown back playing solitary soccer as the credits roll."

        "content": "Fall of Berlin \u2013 1945, The Fall of Berlin, or just Berlin () is a Soviet documentary film about the Battle of Berlin, titled in Russian , literally The Battle for Berlin \u2013 1945. The film was directed by Yuli Raizman and Yelizaveta Svilova. The film begins with an animated map of Eastern Europe with Soviet soldier double exposed on the bottom. The narrator lists the names of the rivers that the Red Army crosses as they march west: Volga, Don, Desna, Dnieper, Bug, Dvina, Neman, Vistula, and finally, Oder. The Soviet arrival at the Oder river is shown, along with the broken bridges across it. The undeterred men of the Red Army are shown as they cross the river while under German fire. The use of missile artillery by the Soviet forces is showcased. After the Oder is crossed, the assault on Berlin itself begins. Footage of the actual battle is shown, as the Red Army fights German troops, street by street and building by building. This is interspersed with shots of Nazi propaganda films showing parades in the same areas, providing a sense of irony. A dramatic sequence follows a detachment of the Red Army in the assault on the Reichstag, which ends with the famous photograph, raising the Red Flag over the Reichstag. When the Soviet troops entered Berlin, they began to push forward to the Reichstag. There were soldiers from every available battalion, with flame throwers, rifles, sniper rifles, automatic weapons, like the PPSh-41, and others. There were over 40 Soviet T-34 tanks that were pushing the German soldiers back. The battle for Berlin was one of the longest battles for a city in the years 1900\u20132000. Shortly before the Russian troops entered Berlin, Hitler was ready to make a half-peace with England and the US, giving away Berlin to them. He said: \"I'd rather give Berlin to the Americans or the English, only to prevent Russian forces from taking it over!\", but he thought of this too late. Shortly after that the Russians approached and attacked Berlin. On 8 May 1945, the flag of the USSR replaced the Nazi German flag in Berlin. This was the end of World War II in Europe."

        "content": "Rudy and Mogie Yellow Lodge are Lakota Sioux brothers on the Beaver Creek Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  Mogie, unemployed and with a teenage son. Rudy, a police officer, struggles to care for his brother, nephew and the rest of the town through the hands of law.  Mogie resists Rudy's attempts, preferring to drink and joke about the depressed state of their people and town.  As a child, Rudy had been bitten by a spider, and Mogie told him it was Iktomi, the trickster spider; this spider re-appears to Rudy early in the film and Rudy's attempts to help begin to wander outside the lines of the law. When Rudy is sent on a police call to an abandoned house, he finds the bloodied, dead body of a young man who has been kicked to death.  Rudy sees someone in the darkness, but the stranger escapes and Rudy trips and falls onto a rock before he can identify his quarry. Rudy's friend tells him that rocks are very spiritual and Rudy begins to worry that something has gotten into him, turning him vigilante. He sees a teenage boy wearing the same shoes as the figure who ran away from the scene of the murder, and follows him. Rudy overhears the boy talk with a friend about disposing a pair of boots that connects them to the murder.  Disguising himself with black paint on his face, Rudy sneaks up on the boys with a baseball bat and viciously beats their kneecaps, announcing himself as the ghost of the boy they murdered. While washing the paint off his face, he again sees Iktomi. Angered by a news report about a liquor store in the bordering town profiting off of alcoholic Native Americans, Rudy sets out - again with a painted face - and sets the store on fire. Unknown to Rudy, Mogie was on the roof of the building trying to steal some alcohol. Mogie escapes and survives, but is burned and severely scarred. Shocked, Rudy visits a friend to get instructions on how to deal with Iktomi's spirit; a combination of home remedies and a sweat lodge ceremony. During Mogie\u2019s stay in the hospital, the doctors discover that he is dying, because of his failing liver . After he is released from the hospital, Mogie, his son Herbie, Rudy, and Aunt Helen have dinner, and Mogie brings up American Horse, an Oglala Indian who testified against the 7th Cavalry. This conversation brings up the story of the Wounded Knee Massacre, which Rudy tells to Herbie. Rudy tells Mogie that he started the fire, and Mogie replies that the one thing he can do to make up for it is blow the nose off of George Washington's face on Mount Rushmore. Rudy calls the idea crazy, and refuses. Responding to a police call of a man stuck in a trap, Rudy arrives outside a house to find that the victim, now dead, is Mogie's drinking partner.  The owners of the house seems to have no remorse for the man's death. When Mogie finds out the story behind his friend's death, he goes to the family's house with a gun, but is dissuaded from using it when a child appears in the room. Mogie dies of pneumonia shortly after his son's 18th birthday.  A letter Mogie wrote before his death asks Rudy to care for his son.  Rudy finds out that the liquor store is being rebuilt, and will now be twice as big and have two drive-in windows.  He buys a large can of oil-based red paint and drives to Mount Rushmore.  He climbs to the top, and standing on the head of George Washington, he ponders whether his plan is stupid, he once again sees Iktomi crawling across the paint can. Seeing this, he makes his tribute to Mogie by throwing the can of paint so that it drips down the side of George Washington's nose, almost like a rivulet of bloody tears. On the drive back, he sees a hitchhiker that looks like Mogie in his youth and laughs."

        "title": "Skins (2002 film)_Cultural background",
        "content": "The Lakota originated from the Great Lakes region where they were called Dakota.  After they were pushed west by the Ojibwe People (Chippewa), they became a fixture of the Plains. Following the enormous herds of buffalo for the subsistence, the Lakota were nomadic in nature. Today there are about 70,000 Lakota, 20,500 of whom speak the Lakota language. Mogie and Rudy are Oglala Lakota as most residents of the Pine Ridge Reservation identify.  Pine Ridge, the reservation where Skins takes place is the largest reservation in South Dakota but the poorest reservation in all of the United States, with unemployment at around 80% and 49% of its approximate 28,000 live below the poverty line. These statistics have increased from 2002 when the movie was filmed. The harsh living condition and high rates of alcoholism and violence of this particular reservation is very apparent in the film.  Mogie\u2019s door is falling off of the hinges and every one of Rudy\u2019s police calls involves either intoxication or violence or both.  Unfortunately, the fictional film is a very realistic depiction of life on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Pine Ridge was originally part of the Great Sioux Reservation established by the Fort Laramie Treaty in 1868, but after several wars, including the Black Hills War, the reservation was divided into seven reservations, one being Pine Ridge.  The Black Hills were very sacred to the Lakota and the conflict between them and the United States originally started because the Lakota did not want mining to happen in the Black Hills, but the U.S. persisted when gold was found there.  The Black Hills are mentioned in Skins when Rudy's friend is telling him how sacred rocks are (\"like the Black Hills\"). On December 29, 1890, while the U.S. 7th Cavalry was moving the Oglala to Pine Ridge, 300 Oglala were murdered and 25 members of the U.S. 7th Cavalry were killed during what has now been named the Wounded Knee Massacre. Mogie and Rudy tell the story of Wounded Knee over dinner with Herbie and Aunt Helen. \u201cAt that time, all Indian religious ceremonies were banned because [white soldiers] were afraid of them\u201d Rudy tells Herbie.  It is obvious through Mogie\u2019s anger during the story that the injustice of the Wounded Knee Massacre still haunts him. Through the rest of the film, Mogie\u2019s satirical humor makes it clear that the white man\u2019s power still looms over Pine Ridge through the faces of Mount Rushmore that ironically watch over the reservation, and that he hasn\u2019t forgotten the past. In more recent history, 1973 was the year that the American Indian Movement (AIM) led the Wounded Knee Incident, resulting in a 71-day stand-off. On February 27, 1973 AIM members and a handful of Pine Ridge residents seized the town of Wounded Knee to bring to light numerous murders, crimes and charges of corruption committed by the Pine Ridge Tribal Council and the Chairman, Richard A. \"Dick\" Wilson. As a result, FBI agents, the U.S. Marshall's Service, and the National Guard on the other side blockaded all entrances and exits leading to and from Wounded Knee. After Wounded Knee 1973, the persecution, illegal arrests, prosecutorial misconduct and numerous as-yet-unsolved murders continued against various members of AIM and several residents of Pine Ridge. No action was taken by the federal government, not even a cursory investigation, against Dick Wilson. Wounded Knee 1973 was the culmination of the violence that swarmed the rest of the decade at Pine Ridge, naming it the \u201cmurder capitol of the United States\u201d with up to 170 murders to every 100,000 people in 1976. While no reservation in Canada or the United States is without cases of extreme violence, poverty, substance abuse, and hopelessness, Pine Ridge stands alone in the misery index."

On the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, he tries to persuade the council to vote against a strip-mining contract. Philbert Bono (Farmer) is a hulk of a man guided by sacred visions. He wants to find his medicine, and gather tokens from the spirits.  During a night at the local bar, he gets inspired by watching a car commercial where a white salesman wearing a native headrest advertises to potential customers to find their own \"pony\".  He takes this as a sign, and the next day he visits a junkyard and trades some marijuana to an indifferent proprietor to find his \"war pony\".  As he looks outside the window of the junkyard office, he has a vision of several horses running in his direction, one of them more distinct than the other.  He eventually settles on a beat up and paint-worn 1964 Buick Wildcat sitting in the middle of the yard of other cars, which he names \"Protector\" as the proprietor tosses him the keys.  After a couple of unsuccessful starts, Protector eventually springs to life and he drives off.  Throughout his journey, various parts of the car fall off. Elsewhere, Buddy's estranged sister, Bonnie, is arrested in Santa Fe, New Mexico because of drugs planted in the trunk of her car.  Buddy is later contacted, and is the only family member who can help Bonnie and her children, Jane and Sky Red Bow.  This is eventually revealed as a ploy by the greedy developers trying to pass the strip-mining contract. Without Buddy's presence to vote, they'll have a better chance at succeeding. Buddy does not own a car, but needs to get to his sister. He convinces his childhood acquaintance Philbert to take him to his sister, as Philbert happily obliges telling Buddy that they are \"Cheyenne\". In their childhood, Buddy found Philbert awkward and embarrassing, and Philbert was bullied for being fat. Buddy's attitude towards Philbert has not changed very much, but wonders if Philbert remembers how mean he had been to him.  Buddy's absence attracts concern that he won't arrive in time, but the tribal chief insists that he will always find a way and that he has done more for the community than anyone else has. They set out on their road trip, and Philbert's easygoing ways contrast with Buddy's more reactive personality.  Philbert's frequent stops to pray and eat prove irritating to Buddy, as rather than going directly to Santa Fe, Philbert is motivated by his own journey to gather \"good medicine\" to help them get Bonnie out of prison, even going so far as to take a detour.  Along the way they meet with friends in other communities, attend a Pow Wow at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation where Buddy dances with other veterans, and visit the sacred Black Hills in South Dakota where Philbert reverently leaves a giant Hershey's chocolate bar as an offering to his ancestors. Eventually Buddy joins Philbert in praying and singing to the ancestors in a river. Gradually, the men grow to appreciate and respect one another.  Meanwhile, Bonnie has her children contact her best friend, Rabbit, to help pay for the $2000 bail.  Unfortunately, it cannot be processed until after the holidays. When they finally reach Santa Fe, they meet up with Bonnie's friend Rabbit and cause a scene at the precinct.  As Rabbit and Buddy interact with the cops, Philbert manages to take $4000 in cash from one of the open rooms.  The three eventually regroup at a local area to drink, where Rabbit and Buddy form a minor attraction towards one another.  Philbert agrees to fetch Bonnie's kids, who were staying at a nearby hotel and takes them without officially checking out.  They head directly to the precinct where Bonnie is being held without telling Buddy and Rabbit, who also try to get there. The tribal chief has also arrived to talk to Bonnie.  Philbert received inspiration from a scene out of an old western during one of their stops, and puts it to use by breaking Bonnie out of jail by using Protector and a rope to yank the jail bars off the building.  As the tribal chief was waiting, he notices through the window what Philbert had been doing and quietly leaves the precinct in his truck without telling anyone else. A police chase ensues and Buddy temporarily stays behind to slow down their pursuit by throwing the loose window of Philbert's car at one of the cop cars, causing it to crash.  He is soon picked up by Philbert as they continue their escape outside the city.  However, Protector loses its brakes on a downhill road, forcing everyone to jump from the car except Philbert who seemingly perishes in the wreck.  Seeing the car in flames, the police decide to call off the chase, and backup and leave the scene.  After mourning Philbert's death, Buddy, Rabbit, Bonnie and her kids discover that Philbert actually survived the crash and they embrace him.  Philbert returns Buddy's necklace, and the two join the others as they walk down the highway.  Fortunately, the chief of their tribe had been following them after the jailbreak and pulls up with his truck to give them a ride home, presumably to get home in time to vote against the strip-mining contract."

He then gets back to Tel Aviv as he has finished his military service. There he shares a flat with another gay man, Yali, and a woman, Lulu, who works in a soap shop. The three roommates live a generally bohemian life. Ashraf arrives at the apartment to return Noam's passport, which he had dropped and left at the checkpoint. Noam takes Ashraf to the roof to look at the city skyline. They talk and Ashraf kisses Noam and they spend the night together. Soon it is agreed that Ashraf will move in with them and work in Yali's restaurant as a Jew under the name Shimi, as he could not be openly gay in the Palestinian territories like he can in the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Tel Aviv. For a time, all goes well for the couple despite some jealousy on the part of Yali. However, Ashraf flees to his family in Nablus when he is recognized by Lulu's former boyfriend as a Palestinian. Ashraf does not return any of Noam's calls. Noam is devastated by Ashraf's desertion, and refuses to get out of bed. When the news reports violence in Ashraf's hometown, Noam becomes worried. He and Lulu go to the West Bank identifying themselves as French television journalists and find Ashraf at his parents' house and there the two men kiss. Ashraf's future brother-in-law, Jihad (who is a Hamas militant), sees them and repudiates him, adding that Ashraf has to marry his cousin or he will reveal his secret. Lulu and Noam leave in a hurry, but encourage Ashraf to come to their anti-occupation rave party. Ashraf shows up, and he and Noam spend another night together. Before his sister's wedding ceremony, Ashraf tells her he is in love with a man. She angrily refuses to believe him, and Ashraf is devastated. Later, during the wedding, he overhears Jihad planning a bombing in Tel Aviv. Yali is maimed in the bombing, and will never walk again. The next morning, Ashraf's sister is killed by stray bullets in a military raid seeking those responsible for the Tel Aviv bombing, before his very eyes. At the funeral Jihad promises revenge, telling Ashraf's father that his daughter was a martyr and will not die in vain. Jihad once again demands that Ashraf marry his cousin, revealing a poster of Ashraf's involvement with the Israeli rave. It is clear at this point that Ashraf is walled in and feels no hope of escape from his situation. His brother-in-law, Jihad, decides to avenge the death of his newlywed bride, and while creating a suicide video, Ashraf decides to take Jihad's place as a suicide bomber in Tel Aviv. Ashraf wanders the streets of Tel Aviv with a sorrowful and blank expression. He winds up at the cafe in which he once worked. When Ashraf primes his explosive belt, Noam sees him from inside the bar where he has just bought Yali's and Lulu's dinner, and rushes out to Ashraf. Seeing Noam, Ashraf walks away from the bar to the middle of the street. As Noam approaches, Ashraf turns to face him. The two stare at each other and start to kiss when the bomb explodes, killing them both. The news report that Ashraf avoided more death by suddenly turning away from the cafe into the empty street. The film ends with Noam talking about the love the two shared, wondering whether they ever had a chance, wishing for a place where they can just love each other, and hoping that people will see \"how stupid these wars are\", over a scene of young Noam and young Ashraf playing together as children in Jerusalem, their mothers sitting side by side."

        "content": "Piano prodigy Ye Xianglun (Jay Chou) lives with his father (Anthony Wong Chau-sang). In 1999, Xianglun transfers into the famous music school, Tamkang (Danjiang) Secondary School, where his father is a teacher. His classmate Qingyi (Alice Tzeng) gives him a campus tour, noting that the piano building will be torn down on graduation day. In the building, he hears a beautiful, mysterious melody (\"Secret\"), leading him to Lu Xiaoyu (Gwei Lun-mei), another piano student. After class, Xianglun asks Xiaoyu about the song; she tells him it is a secret that cannot be told. Xianglun and Xiaoyu spending time together in the practice rooms or around town. They share their first kiss after he gives her a rare music score that he won for her at a school piano battle. When Xianglun tells Xiaoyu about the demolition of the piano building on graduation day, she plays him the mysterious song \"Secret\", telling him never to play it on the piano room's oldest piano. Xiaoyu skips class for days. An undercurrent of jealousy also begins to develop as Qingyi tries to get closer with Xianglun. In class a few days later, Xianglun passes a note to Xiaoyu asking her to meet him at the practice rooms. However, Qingyi shows up instead, and Xianglun accidentally kisses her since his eyes are closed. He realizes his mistake when the janitor loudly says hello to Xiaoyu outside the door; Xianglun rushes out, but she is already out of sight. He goes to Xiaoyu's home to clear things up, but her mother says she is sick and had dropped out of school a long time ago. She tells Xianglun not to look for her daughter again. Five months later, graduation day had arrived, with Xianglun set to perform on stage at the graduation ceremony. Qingyi lends him her bracelet to wish him luck. Halfway through the performance, Xianglun sees Xiaoyu by the door, and they share a smile before she quickly leaves. Xianglun abandons the performance and runs outside, chasing down Xiaoyu and embracing her, telling her to wait for him. However, before he goes back, she sees Qingyi's bracelet on his wrist. When Xianglun goes looking for Xiaoyu after the ceremony a few minutes later, he cannot find her anywhere. Upon asking a few classmates if they had seen the girl he was always with, they are confused and reply that he was always alone. Xianglun begins to have flashbacks to all the times they hung out together, but in those memories, she is missing and he is alone. Desperate for answers, he races to Xiaoyu's house. She is missing, but Xiaoyu's mother gives him a photo of Xiaoyu with his father. Xianglun rushes home and asks his father about her. The film cuts to a scene with Xiaoyu, in 1979 (20 years ago), speaking with Xianglun's father (her teacher at the time, at the same school). She confesses that she had found a score hidden in the oldest piano on campus, called \"Secret\", and when she played it on the piano, she had traveled forward in time 20 years and met Xianglun. However, she explains that during her time travels, she can only be seen by the first person she sees, and she doesn't always succeed in seeing Xianglun first, so it appears as though she is missing most days. However, she is now depressed since she had caught him kissing another girl, then saw that girl's bracelet on his wrist. Since she never wants to see him again, she gives the score of \"Secret\" to Xianglun's father. Naturally, Xianglun's father thinks the story is ridiculous, and believes she is suffering from some mental illness, a sentiment quickly becoming shared by the entire class of 1979, as well as Xiaoyu's mother. Back in the present, Xianglun realizes that the music piece that she showed him was \"Secret\", and could take the pianist into the past or future if played at the right speed, on the old piano. He rushes off to the piano building, which is about to be torn down. At the same time, Xianglun's father retrieves the manuscript of \"Secret\" that Xiaoyu had given to him for safekeeping, and realizes that Xiaoyu had written a message (20 years ago) to Xianglun on the back, corroborating her stories of time travel. Meanwhile, Xianglun enters the piano room and, as the demolition begins, starts to play \"Secret\" from memory, remembering Xiaoyu's words, \"I always play it fast when I want to go back\". He continues playing as the building crashes down around him; just before he is smashed by a wrecking ball, he plays the last note. The scene cuts to outside the classroom. Xianglun peeks inside, and Xiaoyu looks back at him and smiles. The last scene shows the 1979 graduation photo of Tamkang (Danjiang) Secondary School, with Xianglun and Xiaoyu standing next to each other."

As his losses mount and time counts down, Collins resorts to exploiting a young woman, Veronica, that he has picked up to distract his friends in a poker game.  Despite the successful distraction, he still loses, and he rejects Veronica's sexual advances, as he considers her to be bad luck.  When Collins drops her off at her house, Veronica's mother sees her daughter in tears and glares at Collins.  Collins later tracks down Veronica's mother, Leila, and defends himself, stating that he did not have sex with her.  Unimpressed, Leila rebukes him, which causes him to reassess his behavior and offer a sincere apology.  Surprised by his apology, Leila slowly warms to Collins, and they begin a romance.  Having lost his lucky lighter, Collins asks her for a keepsake, but Leila tells him that he must make his own luck and avoid whatever trouble in which he's become involved. Meanwhile, Chicago cuts off Collins from his bookies and gives him 48 hours to either repay his debt or murder Joey, a young suspect held in custody.  Mike Henshaw, Collins' corrupt partner, suggests murdering Chicago, but Collins, unwilling to welch on a bet or murder Joey, decides instead to rob Louie, a local loanshark.  Collins recruits Henshaw and another corrupt cop, James Nutter, and, over their objections, brings in a more strait-laced cop, Fred Shuster.  Unknown to the others, Shuster has discovered that his wife, Katie, is having an affair with Henshaw.  Distraught and feeling betrayed, Shuster agrees to work with Lt. Webber to bring down the corrupt cops.  However, the robbery is botched when the trigger-happy Henshaw kills Louie before he can open the safe.  Collins hires a local locksmith to crack Louie's safe, and the group splits up.  Collins and Shuster arrive at the meeting point, but Lt. Webber is already there; Webber betrays Shuster, killing him, and shoots Collins in the gut.  Collins escapes, but Webber steals the money. Nutter and Henshaw, suspecting that Collins has betrayed them, arrive at the meeting point and discover Shuster's body.  Before they can track down Collins and kill him, they are surrounded by the police.  When Nutter attempts to surrender, Henshaw kills him; Henshaw is killed in turn by the other cops.  Collins hitches a ride back to town and surprises Katie and Webber, who are having an affair.  Over their objections, Collins burns most of the money while denouncing them both for betraying Fred.  After alerting the cops to Webber's involvement, Collins takes enough money to pay off his gambling debt and meets with Chicago.  Amused, Chicago accepts the money but mocks Collins' reluctance to murder Joey; Chicago reveals that he has had Joey murdered in prison and points out that had Collins simply murdered Joey, all of this trouble could have been avoided.  Enraged, Collins kills Chicago and his bodyguards, then stumbles back to his car, where he apparently dies of his wounds."

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on November 15, 1998. The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \"Drive\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 11.0, being watched by 18.5 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder is trapped in a car by a seemingly deranged man, and Scully races to determine if the man is suffering from a deadly illness\u2014and if Mulder is in danger of becoming the next victim of some sort of government conspiracy. The episode was written by Vince Gilligan, directed by Rob Bowman, and featured a guest appearance by Bryan Cranston. Gilligan cast Cranston to play the antagonist because he felt he could successfully humanize the role. Cranston's success in \"Drive\" later led to his casting as Walter White in Gilligan's AMC series Breaking Bad."

Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman, his wife, begins violently banging her head against the police car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window. Mulder and Scully get wind of this bizarre car chase as they're doing work in Buhl, Idaho investigating possible domestic terrorism. Mulder coerces Scully into taking a detour to Elko, Nevada on a hunch that this may be an X-File. Crump, who has started to develop symptoms of a sickness, is put in an ambulance. Mulder, wishing to speak to Crump, follows the ambulance and ends up being kidnapped by Crump, who has escaped from the police. Mulder realizes that Crump is suffering from a painful sensation of pressure building in his head and that the only way to alleviate this pressure is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of infection; she takes a hazmat team to investigate the Crumps' home and finds a dog suffering the same symptoms and dead birds on a neighbor's property, but on noting that the neighbor herself, who is deaf, was unaffected, she then discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seem to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure. Initially, thinking that the FBI agent is part of a government conspiracy, Crump forces Mulder at gunpoint to drive, infuriating him along the way with antisemitic slurs. Eventually, Mulder and Crump make amends and attempt to work out a solution before it is too late. Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will insert a needle into Crump's inner ear, hopefully relieving the pressure. Unfortunately, when Scully arrives, Crump has already died."

        "content": "Vince Gilligan, the writer of \"Drive\", was inspired to pen the episode based on an earlier idea he had about a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan had pitched this idea at several previous story meetings and it soon became a recurring joke among the show's writers, many of whom felt that the premise lacked an X-Files-like mystery. Gilligan soon revised his story so that after the ride was shut off, the man's head would explode. This led to Gilligan researching various government experiments, and soon he learned about two real-life military experiments: Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), whereas the latter is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Gilligan thus wrote a script that featured an individual who, due to a secret experiment involving soundwaves, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head. Gilligan admitted that the episode was partially an homage to the action film Speed (1994), and contains a reference to the film: when Crump and Mulder discover that speeding west is the key to success, Mulder mentions that he thinks he \"saw this movie.\" The opening teaser footage is done in the style of a news report, a stylistic direction that IGN suggested was intended to echo the O.J. Simpson Ford Bronco chase from 1994."

        "content": "Hum Eik Hain begins with an Aaan showing Badshahi Mosque and other parts of Lahore with rather badly photographed (and badly lit) clips. The titles end on Shan (Mustafa) who is the muezzin. He is educated, wears jeans and is looking for a job. However, he can't get a job even with repeated interviews. The academic degrees are not even worth good enough to be sold as waste paper. Trash must go to trash and the degrees are burnt alive in a rage of disappointment and frustration. There seems to be plenty of fire around at nights around Lahore with flames burning inside large empty drums (read 'a heavy symbolism of hero's agony'). Shan's mother is very religious and dresses like a nun in white. She helps children with Quran lessons and baptizes babies by marking '786' on their foreheads (it is supposed to be a good omen). Coming back to fire in the streets, Shan watches a Maulana being gunned down in cold blood. He is a witness and must suffer at the hands of the police and the establishment. Shan joins Nisar Qadri's gang, delivering bags (containing bombs) from one place of the town to other and is instrumental in inadvertently killing his mother who happens to be traveling in one such bus to be blown up on Nisar Qadri's command. Shan is strictly not allowed to see inside the bag and find out what deadly explosives he has been carrying and delivering. It is time for him to change his loyalties, which he quickly does. He builds up a gang of his own, who wear red bandanas with '786' emblazoned on them. The villains must be paid in their own currency and the scores are settled on the occasion of Ashura when crowds are purifying their sins from events of Karbala. A van carrying explosives by Haider Sultan is diverted minutes before but blood baths are choreographed simultaneously in the nearby deserted streets. The man behind these deadly schemes, Nisar Qadri, is butchered in his decorative temple, right across the street from Badshahi Mosque"

After a heated conversation at the kitchen table, Peter and David retrieve the unconscious Tracey from the car trunk. As they try to get her upstairs Peter gets sidetracked by her chest not realizing that she has woken up. She headbutts him several times and Peter screams with pain. David manages to get her off him and has to fix Peter's now bloody and broken nose after tying her to the bed frame. The pair hold her for ransom in a secluded country cottage. Things begin to go wrong when Arnie's dimwitted son and stepbrother of Tracey, Andrew (Steve O'Donnell) delivers the ransom. Instead of money, the bag is filled with napkins. David and Peter realize that not only have they been deceived, but Arnie knew about Andrew's involvement in the scheme all along. After Peter breaks David's phone by accidentally dropping it in water, David goes down to the village to use a telephone box to call in another ransom. While there, he happens across some sinister locals who, upon learning that he and his companions are staying at the Barnarby Cottage, warn him to keep his doors locked and not to wander. Disturbed, David returns to the cottage to find that Tracey \u2014 who has proven to be highly intelligent and resourceful, albeit foul-mouthed and somewhat psychopathic \u2014 has incapacitated Andrew and abducted Peter. Some distance away, Peter and Tracey arrive at an ominous looking farm. Upon entering the house, they soon discover it to be the home of an insane and hideously deformed serial-killer known only as the Farmer. After opening a trapdoor in the kitchen to reveal a secret staircase leading down into the cellar, Tracey is stabbed through the stomach by the Farmer. Terrified, Peter flees upstairs and jumps out of the bedroom window. Tracey survives her injury and calls out for Peter to help her escape too, all with the Farmer in pursuit. Peter manages to incapacitate the Farmer with a shovel, saving Tracey's life. Tracey then urges Peter to kill the madman before he regains consciousness, but he is reluctant. As the two of them argue, the Farmer comes to and quickly amputates the end of Peter's foot with the shovel. As he is about to kill Peter, Tracey begins mocking him, ordering him to hurry up and do it. Frustrated, the Farmer suddenly turns around and gruesomely decapitates her at mouth-level with the shovel. He then knocks out a hysterical Peter and hangs him by his jacket from a meat-hook in the shed. Meanwhile, Andrew and David, discover Andrew's hairdresser Steven (Simon Schatzberger), dying from being disemboweled, before setting off through the woods in search of Peter and Tracey, when they stumble across the dead body of one of Arnie's henchmen, who has had his throat slit. Soon after, they arrive at the farm, where they discover a shed full of severed heads. David and Andrew hurry outside, where the Farmer pins David to the ground with a pickaxe through his leg. He then chases Andrew into the nearby horse stables, where he viciously attacks him with a hunting knife before ripping his spine out. Peter comes to and manages to release himself from the hook and crawl across the ground to David. After making up for a lifetime of squabbling, they vow to fight on, and drag themselves back into the farmhouse in search of a phone. The Farmer soon reappears, tossing Andrew's severed head and spine through the window. David attempts to defend his brother, only to be suddenly impaled by The Farmer with the pickaxe. Outraged at seeing his brother murdered, Peter begins to throttle the Farmer to death by strangling him with a length of rope. The Farmer manages to toss Peter down into the cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has the end of the rope, and he continues tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door. With the weight of the body on top of the door, Peter is unable to escape. With nowhere else to go, he descends down into the cellar. He flicks on his cigarette lighter to reveal the Farmer's equally insane and hideous wife and daughters standing all around him. He mutters defeated \"You must be joking\" before they set upon him, the lighter goes out and Peter screams as they attack him. After the credits, Arnie and his right-hand men are seen arriving at the farm. As they step up to the front door, the Farmer suddenly rushes out at them with the pickaxe raised above his head. As he swings at them with it, the image freezes and the screen fades to black."

        "content": "In a small, isolated village on the West side of England, seven-year-old Brydie White is running with a playmate, Julian, who trips and falls. He is accidentally killed by his Fathers loaded shotgun that he was playing with. Brydie is injured with a wound to her head causing some brain damage. Ten years later, Brydie (Hayley Mills) can remember the boy but can't remember the accident. She regularly visits Juilan's grave but is not sure why she does. She has an argument with the old gravedigger who aggressively tells her that her dog is not allowed in the graveyard. She is rescued by a young man (Ian McShane) whom the old man calls a \"gypo\" and a \"tinker\". Her mother (Annette Crosbie, in her first film role) is a sad and lonely person who drinks heavily and is a dysfunctional Mother. Brydie is a tomboy with a fascination for death and dead animals, and spends her time climbing trees and being a nuisance to the adults in the small village where she lives. She spends much of her time with the local children and tells them that all dead things should be buried, including animals. They agree to go round the village collecting up all the dead animals they can find and plan to bury them all in the graveyard that night. It becomes apparent that some of the adults, especially the dead boy's father, are convinced that Brydie is a bad influence on the other children, that something should be done to discipline her and agree that her Mother not a good role model and to be looked down upon. Their negative attitude and behaviour are compounded by their disapproval that her mother was not married to her late father. The Vicar wakes the next morning to find his graveyard full of little graves the children have made to bury the animals and tries to explain to Brydie that because they have no souls, they cannot be buried there but understanding her simplicity and good intentions asks Julians Father if he would give a small corner of his land to the children to have their own animal graveyard. However, the father is embittered and has never forgiven Brydie for surviving and holds her responsible for killing his son. He confronts her, accusing her of murdering Julian. Horrified and scared that it might be true, she runs in a fit of hysteria and falls in the river where she is rescued by the gypsy boy, Roibin. When he carries her into the nearby gypsy camp, his grandmother says \"you can't keep away from women, can you?\". The gypsy's do not want her there, knowing that it will only bring trouble and we learn that Roibin has a reputation for trouble but seeing the fevered state of Brydie, the Grandmother takes her in and, begrudgingly, nurses her well. During the weeks Brydie is away, her mum drinks more heavily, distraught over Brydie's disappearance. She has a heart attack and dies. The Police interview the gypsies but they deny knowledge of the girl. When police dogs are brought in they lead police to the river edge and the worst is feared. As Brydie recovers, she and Roibin become close and he helps her to face and talk about what happened with Julian. He asks her to stay with him and the gypsies when they move on. She says that she couldn't leave her Mum and needs to go home. He pledges his love for her and they kiss in a meadow.  The village children find them there and tell her that her mother died during her absence. Upset, she decides to go to see her Mothers grave and realising that she has nothing to stay home for, promises to return to Roibin. He teaches her how to read sticks that will tell her which direction the gypsies will have gone if they leave before she gets back. She shares a final kiss with Roibin and leaves with the children. The children run to tell the Vicar that Brydie is at her mothers grave and he gathers her up and takes her to his house promising to look after her. Brydie insists that she must return to Roibin as she has nothing to stay for and the Vicar promises to tell Roibin to come and collect Brydie in the morning as she is still unwell, exhausted and needs a good nights sleep. Relieved, Brydie falls asleep while the Vicar asks the gravedigger to go the gypsy camp and tell Roibin to come and get Brydie in the morning. He goes but tells the gypsies to leave immediately as they are unwanted and threatens to call the Police to arrest them for kidnapping Brydie. They are angry at this and begin to pack up straight away. Roibin tries to make the gypsies stay until Brydie returns so that she can go with them but they attack him, blaming him for this unwanted trouble, they don't want her with them and Roibin is beaten up. By late morning, the vicar is convinced that Roibin is not coming and agrees with his wife that Brydie will probably be institutionalised. Brydie convinces the Vicar that Roibin loves her and shows him a special token that Roibin made for her of their hair intertwined into an eternal ring. The vicar and Brydie (and her dog) go to the campsite and find it abandoned \"like they were never here\" (apart from piles of rubbish and debris). Brydie finds and follows a series of directional marker sticks left by Roibin at junctions. The Vicar follows her to make sure she is safe. She is just beginning to think that she has lost the trail when she hears the barking of another dog and sees a solitary gypsy caravan in a field. Knowing that it is Roibin, she runs to it. The vicar watches as Roibin runs to greet Brydie knowing that this is the right life and future for her."

It featured surrealistic, abstract imagery. During the screening of this short, Brooks overheard another audience member \"mumbling to himself\", an old immigrant man who was voicing his disappointment at the lack of a plot. Brooks was inspired to create a film out of this experience. Brooks contacted Ernest Pintoff, who had experience producing animated works such as Flebus. They agreed to create a short film based on two points: the visuals of the film had to be fashioned in a style similar to that of McLaren, and Brooks would have no specific warning of the content. He intended to improvise his monologue. Pintoff and animator Bob Heath completed the visuals as agreed, then Brooks watched the result and improvised his monologue for the accompanying soundtrack. He used a Russian Jewish accent and attempted to find lines appropriate for an old man \"trying to find a plot in this maze of abstractions.\" Henry Jenkins points that the comments themselves belong to a recognizable narrative mode, the stream of consciousness."

The onscreen images feature geometric patterns. The \"cranky and clueless\" old man is trying to make sense of them, and describes what he sees at various points, including a squiggle, a fence, a cockroach. The old man finds that certain images remind him of the biology classes of his Russian boyhood. When two abstract shapes approach each other and unite, the old man sees it as a mating sequence. \"...They like each other. Sure. Lookit da sparks. Two things in love!... Could dis be the sex life of two things?\" When the scene shifts from the \"mating\" to other abstract images, the old man gets bored. He proclaims the images must be symbolism, then adds that they are symbolic of junk. He eventually concludes that some of the images, depicting lips, are \"dirty\", obscene. He admits at some point that he was looking for \"a hot French picture\", which he hoped would involve nudity. The implication is that the old man is in the wrong movie theater, probably one screening art films. He also wonders why the creator of the film wasted his time with this. He points that this creator could instead do something meaningful, like driving a truck, or do something constructive, like working in shoemaking."

        "content": "When Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard leaves Europe he eventually arrives in the United States where, with the help of Albert Einstein, he persuades the Federal government to build an atomic bomb. General Leslie Groves selects physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to head the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where the bomb is built. As World War II draws to a close, Szilard (whose idea was responsible for the progress made) has second thoughts about atomic weapons and debates how and when to use the bomb. The film focuses on the organization and the politics of the whole affair, such as tensions between the scientists and the military, the communist affiliation of many scientists around that time,  the (perceived) risks of espionage and the decision whether to use the bomb after Germany is defeated. Concerning the actual scientific work on the bomb, some of it is shown, but not explained, so an understanding of the workings of the bomb is needed to understand what is going on in that respect. The story starts with Leo Szilard fleeing Germany on the last train out and trying to convince the military that a nuclear bomb can be built and that the Germans are already working on it. In England, his idea is filed and ignored, so he travels to the US, but there too, he has to wait a year until something is done with it and Project Manhattan is started. As Germany is being defeated and its scientists interrogated, it is found out that they have not even come close to constructing a nuclear bomb (partly due to bad cooperation by scientists). Despite the fact that no one has the technology now, and the original reason for project Manhattan is gone, work continues. Szilard, who first used Einstein to get his ideas about building a bomb across to the US leaders, now convinces him to join him in writing a letter to the president to do the opposite, namely not to build the bomb, in order to avoid an arms race. 68 scientists sign a petition, but that is held back by the military. U.S. President Truman is faced with four options: peace talks (which would require the Japanese to keep their emperor, as eventually happened), a blockade (which was thought to be cowardly), an invasion (estimated by some to cost up to a million lives, though such numbers have been widely disputed), or dropping the bomb. Another consideration is that the USSR had said they would enter the war against Japan three months after the surrender of Germany and there is a fear that they might not leave. So Truman decides that the best course of action is to drop the bomb on Hiroshima, against the advice of General Eisenhower."

Bob, the representative of the Company who hired Mohinder Suresh, sends Mohinder on an assignment, which turns out to be a mission to heal the Haitian. Maya and Alejandro are struggling to get across the border, and are assisted by a woman named Nidia, a family friend. At her house, an unnamed healer tells her that no one can cure her disease, and that her curse is dark enough to kill the Devil himself. Matt Parkman and Detective Fuller visit the roof of the Deveaux Building to investigate Kaito Nakamura's death, and learn that Angela Petrelli was present. Ando explains to Parkman that the helix symbol scrawled on the photograph of Kaito means \"Godsend.\" Parkman and the detective interview Mrs. Petrelli, who alludes to a prior sexual relationship with Kaito. She then realizes that Parkman is reading her thoughts, and mentally demands that he get out of her head. Parkman greets Nathan Petrelli, who has arrived to post his mother's bail. As the two walk to the locked interrogation room to retrieve Mrs. Petrelli, she is apparently attacked by an unseen force. Parkman breaks in, but she is alone in the room, with blood on her face. In her hand is the picture of her with the helix symbol scrawled across it. Hiro Nakamura, still in Japan in 1671, impersonates his hero, Takezo Kensei, in order to correct history. He uses his power to stop time and disarms 11 bandits, rescuing the swordsmith's daughter. As they converse, she expresses her gratitude. Kensei, persuaded by Hiro's pleas \u2014 and the prospect of a relationship with the swordsmith's daughter \u2014 agrees to rescue the swordsmith, but is ambushed by the bandits Hiro earlier disarmed. Kensei appears to be killed by the bandits' arrows, but is somehow able to revive: his wounds heal while Hiro watches, amazed. Claire Bennet, curious about the limits of her abilities, cuts off her little toe to see if it will grow back, which it does, but she discovers that West (who had been watching through her window) has seen the incident. She tries to pursue him, only to find him gone and Chandra Suresh's book lying on her driveway. The episode ends with her mother's dog, Mr. Muggles, barking at the sky."

Jones read an article about Jeffrey Erickson, a suspected bank robber whose wife Jill led the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a chase through 12 different suburbs, with a machine gun hanging out of the window of her van, when they came to capture him, which led to a huge gun battle. She ended up dead, ostensibly taking her own life after she was wounded. He read another article related to the case in The New York Times, and, knowing the author of the articles, tried unsuccessfully to contact him. The rights to the story had already been purchased by someone else, but coincidentally Jones received a screenplay about the couple from the husband-and-wife screenwriting team of Peg Haller and Bob Schneider and producer Richard Maynard, and they agreed to work together. The William Morris talent agency said Luke Perry was interested in the lead role, and they also suggested Ashley Judd for the female lead. Perry was well known for the television series Beverly Hills, 90210 and Spelling Entertainment were willing to put up the money to make the film. The distributor New Line Cinema were optimistic about the film at first. However, test audiences were not expecting a crime drama, instead they expected a Luke Perry movie to be similar to 90210 and reacted negatively. New Line declined to release the film. After director John McNaughton complained in the press, they gave the film a limited release for a week in New York and Los Angeles, and then the film went to HBO. Director John McNaughton explained in a 2017 interview that he intended the film to reflect the economic struggles of the middle class:\"It was a true story and I had followed it because it was so sad. But it was also played for laughs in Chicago. They called him the bearded bandit, because he would wear this fake beard and a Chicago Cubs hat, and he would rob these small banks and get a few thousand dollars. And the TV would go: The bearded bandit struck again today, ha ha ha. But I thought the story was prophetic for what was to come for the American middle class. They just ran out of options and the situation became bleak and hopeless.\"In the same interview McNaughton explained that many of the locations used in the film were the actual locations where the events took place in real life. They shot in a bank that Jeffrey Erickson robbed. And McNaughton said: \"The parking lot where Pam got shot is where we filmed the scene.\""

But Michel is selfish and exploits his father's blind affection, and as he grows up, hating the sea, he becomes addicted to the pleasures of the town, lured into bad behaviour by his friend Guenn-la-Taupe.

        "content": "The film is set in Turin at the end of the 19th century and opens with a scene showing workers of all ages, including young teenager Omero (Franco Ciolli), rising at 5:30 in the morning before heading to a textile factory where they work until 8:30 in the evening. Towards the end of the day, fatigue starts taking its toll and disaster strikes when the hand of a drowsy worker is mangled by a machine. Workers Pautasso (Folco Lulli), Martinetti (Bernard Blier), and Cesarina (Elvira Tonelli) decide to form an ad hoc committee and speak to management and state their case that the 14-hour work day needs to be shortened by one hour to avoid accidents arising from exhaustion. Their request is ignored and they only receive admonishments to be more careful. Moreover, a subsequent attempt by the workers to emphasize their grievances by staging a walkout an hour early on the next evening results in a humiliating defeat when they lose their nerve and stay until the usual time. Professor Sinigaglia (Marcello Mastroianni), a labor activist on the run from the police in Genoa, hops off a freight train and comes to hide in the neighborhood. There, he runs into a meeting where the undeterred workers discuss the idea of all coming to work an hour late to make their point. The bookish-looking, unassuming Sinigaglia becomes involved, and in a burst of fiery rhetoric persuades the workers to escalate their struggle by not coming to work at all and going on strike instead. Drawing on his own experience, he also helps them to prepare effectively by building up a stock of supplies. The workers committee expresses its gratitude by assigning Sinigaglia as a guest to Raoul, a bitter worker who is skeptical about the others' determination as well as the movement's chances of success, and is displeased with this arrangement. After a failed attempt at inducing the strikers to resume work by granting token concessions without shortening work days, management proceeds to bring in workers freshly laid off by another factory to take over. A confrontation ensues between the strikers and the replacement workers, resulting in Pautasso's death. This tragedy draws the attention of the press and the government, forcing the factory owners to send the replacement workers back home. However, the police also manage to track down Sinigaglia to Raoul's home, sending the professor on the move again after a narrow escape. As the duration of the strike reaches a month, the factory owners are suffering severe financial losses and are close to giving in. Unaware of this and suffering from both low supplies and a low morale, workers meet and vote to end the strike. Sinigaglia then reappears, delivers yet more fiery rhetoric and convinces them not only to keep striking but to escalate the movement by occupying the factory. In a showdown between the strikers and an army unit dispatched to block access to the premises, soldiers fire into the crowd, killing Omero and sending the others fleeing. Sinigaglia is arrested by the police, and Raoul has to go into hiding after attacking a police officer. The film's end mirrors its beginning: the grim-faced employees are shown crossing the factory gates to resume work, with Omero now replaced by his younger brother (whom Omero had hoped would obtain a better education and escape the fate of factory workers). Meanwhile, Raoul hops on a freight train to find shelter with a member of the underground labor movement in another city, and is now determined to pursue the struggle."

Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors. The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, who has been dead for a hundred years, the present Mr Blunden being his great-grandson. After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger). They are two children who lived in the house a century earlier. Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their dissolute and hapless Uncle Bertie (James Villiers) and the solicitor Mr Blunden, until Georgie comes of age. Bertie marries a music hall performer, Bella Wickens (Madeline Smith) and her parents then move into Langley Park, ostensibly as the housekeeper and game keeper. The children come to suspect that Mrs. Wickens (Diana Dors) and her disturbed violent husband (David Lodge) are plotting to kill them to get hold of Georgie's inheritance. Sara and Georgie find a book with instructions for travelling through time, so that they can get help. Lucy and Jamie agree to travel back with them; they arrange to meet Sara the next day. Jamie searches the graveyard, in the hope of finding nothing and being able to go back to help, knowing in advance that they will succeed. He and Lucy are shocked to find a gravestone marked with the names of both Sara and Georgie. The sexton explains that the two children died in a fire, whose anniversary turns out to be exactly a hundred years ago tomorrow. The children meet Mr Blunden who admits he has been tormented for over a hundred years because of the events but promises if they both help no harm will come to them. Lucy and Jamie drink the potion and travel back to 1818 in the hope of preventing the tragedy. There they meet Thomas the gardener who believes they are from America, and tells Lucy and Jamie that he wants to go there one day and make his fortune. Mr Blunden is visiting the house that night, but refuses to listen to Sara's pleas for help. That night the children are locked in a room above the library, and given a sleeping potion. Mr Wickens starts a fire in the library, trapping the children. Jamie helps Tom to save Sara, but when he tries to return for Georgie, he finds himself unable to get through the flames. Mr Blunden appears, and tells Jamie that they will go together, holding hands. Jamie is kept safe from the fire, but Mr Blunden suffers the pain that Jamie would have felt. Jamie and Mr Blunden save Georgie, with Blunden perishing in the fire as the staircase gives way, a serene smile on his face. The Wickens perish in the fire. Lucy and Jamie both return to 1918, but Jamie is unconscious and Lucy cannot tell their mother what has happened. At the graveyard, Lucy discovers that the children's gravestone has been replaced by another: that of Frederick Percival Blunden, the \"Good Shepherd\" who \"died to save the children in his care\". Jamie soon awakes and is overjoyed to hear that they have succeeded. Shortly after, the lawyer, Mr Clutterbuck (Graham Crowden), visits them and informs them that recently discovered documents show that Sara Latimer married Thomas and that their great-grandson was the late Mr. Allen. This makes Jamie the rightful heir to the Langley Park. At the end a car pulls up. When Mr Clutterbuck opens the door, sitting inside is Mr Blunden! But which one? The enigmatic phrase he greets them with (\"We three kings of Orient are\") is one they recognise from their first encounter. They have all the answers they need. The film ends with the cast saying goodbye to the audience one by one as their names are shown on-screen."

Serena's best friend, Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), however, is less than thrilled to see her again, especially when her plans of losing her virginity to her boyfriend, Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), are interrupted when Serena arrives unexpectedly at a party. In spite of their heart-to-heart talk together, Serena and Blair's re-ignited friendship is short-lived when Nate confesses to her that he and Serena slept together the night before she left, and although Blair forgives Nate, she refuses to forgive Serena. Outsider Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) who has a secret crush on Serena, which dates back even before her mysterious departure, is once again drawn to her as soon as he learns that she has arrived back in town and, after trying to return Serena's phone to her, she asks him out on a date simply as an excuse not to go to Blair's \"Kiss on the Lips\" party. Dan takes Serena to his dad's band's concert, but they are forced to leave when his younger sister Jenny (Taylor Momsen) sends him a text message from Blair's party asking for help.

They find her on the roof, where an egotistical sex-addicted Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) is attempting to rape her.

The apparent reason for Serena's abrupt return is revealed to be her younger brother Eric (Connor Paolo), who unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide but is now living in a psychiatric institution. Not even \"Gossip Girl\" is aware of this. In addition, the past affair between Dan and Jenny's father Rufus (Matthew Settle) and Serena and Eric's mother is brought to light when Lily (Kelly Rutherford) asks Rufus whether he is using his son to get close to her again."

He wanted to make a film on Les Darcy, Something Great, and collaborated with Jonathan Hardy on the script. They could not secure financing but Hardy showed Howson some other scripts he had written, including Backstage. Backstage had originally been meant to be directed in 1982 by John Lamond starring Max Phipps, Jill Perryman and Steve Tandy but the film did not eventuate. Howson and Hardy decided to work on Backstage together, with the story being relocated to the music world. Howson got Laura Branigan interested in the lead. The Burrowes Film Group needed to make another film before the end of the financial year and offered to raise the budget. Frank Howson originally thought that the involvement of the Burrowes Film Group would be limited but found they wanted to have more creative control. \"I knew very clearly what audience it should be made for\", said Howson, \"but all of a sudden I found myself dealing with production by committee. To even make the smallest decision required everyone sitting around the table.\" Matters reached an impasse when Howson and Burrowes fought over who would compose the music. Burrowes fired Howson's composer, John Capek, and replaced him with Bruce Rowlands, then Burrowes bought Boulevard out of the film. Filming started 7 March 1986."

Whitefeather seems to have the whole company under a spell as he spiels his nonsensical idioms filled with Native American mumbo jumbo. The top executives seem more content with chanting Indian-style noises rather than listening to how they can make money through sound investments. When Evan discovers that his daughter, Olivia (Shahidi), is able to tell the future within the financial world by using her \"goo-gaa\" comfort blanket and her imaginary friends (Queen Qwali and Princesses Kupida, Sopida and Mopida), he discovers that he now has an invaluable upper hand at the office. During work, Olivia accidentally draws all over Evan's worksheets for a meeting. Outraged, Evan goes to the meeting and he shows off the paperwork and explains that ChemStar is sparkly, and Aerodyne and Yellowfin will get married, confusing his colleagues. Evan thinks he is about to be fired, but his boss informs him that all his predictions came through. The share price of ChemStar shot up, while Aerodyne and Yellowfin were preparing to merge. After only a few days with Olivia, Evan rediscovers his inner child, and has fun playing imaginary games with Olivia. Whitefeather becomes suspicious and begins to search for Evan's secret. When he learns that Evan was just playing with a wakalyapi blanket, Whitefeather purchases a six thousand dollar blanket and forces his son to tell him the \"future\" and makes him extremely hyperactive by making him drink many cans of Red Bull. Whitefeather and Evan are now competing for the position of heading the Western division of the company D.D.E. In order to be prepared for the most important presentation of his life, Evan must once again invoke the use of the Goo-Gaa blanket and meet with the princesses. Olivia is spending the night at her friend's house, and there is no way for Evan to obtain the Goo-Gaa without taking it from her. Also, the presentations will be held on the day of Olivia's class play. Evan manages to get Olivia to give him the Goo-Gaa, but she is soon seen crying because he seems to care only about the blanket, not her. Evan returns home and tries to get the princesses' attention. Evan then starts working on his presentation. As hours pass, Evan stretches, and the Goo-Gaa falls on the floor, but he continues working without noticing. Evan decides to go to the presentation instead of Olivia's class concert. Johnny gives his presentation, but his idea is too crazy for the owner of the company. Then it is Evan's turn. When he is about to present, Evan suddenly decides to go to Olivia's class concert, and leaves the presentation. As he drives over, Evan changes into a king costume. Back at the class concert, Olivia is about to sing her solo part when Evan appears dressed as a king, and Olivia starts singing, delighted to see him. After the class concert, Evan tells Olivia how sorry he is for misusing her blanket, not caring about her, and for using the princesses for the wrong reason. Meanwhile, the owner of the company, D.D.E. appears, and wants to talk to Evan. He and Evan talk, and he decides to give the position to Evan because of how much Evan cares about his family. Evan accepts. Evan goes back to Olivia, for whom it is time to say good-bye to the princesses. They both start waving, and as a gust of wind blows, some leaves form into the shape of a person then fly off into the sky. Evan, Olivia's mother Trish, and Olivia leave happy."

In a small village in Punjab, the birthplace of Lucky, there lives another Sikh, Happy Singh (Akshay Kumar). Happy, though good at heart, has unintentionally caused many problems in the village, and the villagers are fed up with him. They decide to send Happy on a long trip to Australia with his friend Rangeela (Om Puri) to bring Lucky back to Punjab, which will keep Happy out of the village for some time and bring peace to the village. But at the airport, Happy's and Rangeela's tickets to Australia are accidentally exchanged with those of Puneet (Ranvir Shorey), who was to fly to Egypt. In Egypt, Happy meets Sonia (Katrina Kaif) and falls deeply in love with her. But he does not express his love to her. Leaving her behind, he heads to Australia to meet Lucky. Lucky refuses to return to his hometown and throws Happy and Rangeela out of his house. Penniless, Happy finds warmth and affection in an elderly lady (Kirron Kher) who provides him with food in spite of being a stranger. Lucky winds up in a hospital, paralyzed, after a series of violent incidents that Happy has caused. (In one of these incidents, his head is bumped severely, and the trauma from the resultant concussion is what paralyzes him.) Unexpectedly, it is Happy who is given the position of the \"Kinng.\" The lady who helped Happy is obviously worried and depressed, as her daughter is returning from Egypt with her wealthy boyfriend, Puneet. The daughter does not know that after the death of her father years ago, her mother had become poverty-stricken and been reduced to work as a flower seller. Happy gives her Lucky's spacious house and makes all his mafia associates work for her. The lady's daughter arrives; to Happy's horror, she is none other than Sonia. Heartbroken, Happy is forced to make a show of happiness to Sonia. Puneet says that he too would have had a good time with Happy and Sonia in Egypt had his ticket to Egypt not been exchanged in the airport, because of which he had ended up in Australia. Puneet had always been jealous of Sonia being with Happy; however, he doubts something is going on between them. Meanwhile, Lucky's gang members spend enough time with the kindhearted Kinng for most of them to be reformed and give up lawless lives in favour of law-abiding ones. In spite of herself, Sonia falls in love with Happy and the truth becomes difficult to hide. Puneet sets his heart to marry Sonia. Sonia gets trapped in an emotional tug-of-war between Puneet, who loves her, and Happy, whom she loves. In the confusion, Happy's associates reveal to Puneet who they are, and that Happy is the Kinng of the Australian underworld, not a manager as Puneet had believed him to Puneet, in turn, reveals this to Sonia, who has become aware of her own poverty. Soon Puneet meets Mika, Lucky's other brother, who agrees to kill Happy. Puneet's motives to kill Happy, however, differ from Mika's: Puneet wants to kill Happy to keep Sonia away from him, whereas Mika wants to kill Happy to make himself Kinng. On the day of Punnet and Sonia's marriage , they are sitting in mandap and they are set all to marry but gunshots firing are heard and all the gangster also come in mandap puneet leaves mandap in order to save himself from gunshot. Happy take punnet s place in order to save Sonia unaware that he is marrying sonia, both run around the fire seven times, essentially getting married.After Happy and Sonia married then punnet seeks forgiveness from them and then punnet s father take him.(During all this, Lucky's head is bumped, and the trauma-induced paralysis he had suffered from is relieved.) Suddenly, Mika turns up on the spot, ready to kill Happy, armed with a gang and his new special glasses and hearing aid. As he is about to shoot, Lucky steps up and stops him. Then a dialogue ensues between Mika, Happy, Lucky, and the associates of the Kinng. Then Happy tells him that being the \"kinng\" is not as great as it may seem and explains to him the characteristics of a true Sikh. Lucky confesses that he had always found being Kinng a source of misery, because a true kinng fights for others, not for himself. Overcome with remorse, Mika drops his gun. The movie ends with Happy's and Sonia's marriage and the returns of Lucky and his gang members to their homes in the village."

Michael asks Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to design an animated logo, and she works all night on it. Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) mission to enlist visiting author Sue Grafton to appear in the ad is unsuccessful.

Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), meanwhile, struggles throughout the day to recall the product name from an advertising jingle that contains the lyrics \"Gimme a break. Gimme a break. Break me off a piece of that...\" Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) has largely removed himself to the online virtual world of Second Life. Dwight has created an avatar named Dwight Shelford, also a paper salesman, patterned after his once-perfect real life. He now uses Second Life as an escape from his real-life troubles, even going as far as creating a virtual Second Life, called Second Second Life. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) also creates his own avatar named Jim Samtanko, a guitar-playing Philadelphia sportswriter, and enters Second Life in order to spy on Dwight. Dwight has also reluctantly become Andy's confidante regarding his relationship with Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), Dwight's former girlfriend. Dwight's spirits are lifted when he learns that, during a makeout session with Andy, Angela cried, \"Oh, D!\". Though, Andy is oblivious to the fact that Angela was referring to Dwight. After the corporate headquarters rejects Michael's ad, the office employees gather at Poor Richard's Pub to watch the professionally filmed commercial, which Michael refers to as \"the world premiere of corporate crapfest.\" After the commercial, Jim plays Michael's version of the ad on the bar's television set. Over the theme from Chariots of Fire, as Michael narrates \"trite catchphrases\", a sheet of paper is depicted making a journey around the world, carrying a variety of messages meaningful to the recipients; as Pam's animated whirling sheets of paper coalesce into the company logo to end the ad, the employees as well as the other patrons of the bar show their approval. The episode ends with Andy doing an interview, still trying to recall the product name from the jingle. On the basis that it has to rhyme, he incorrectly concludes that it promotes Fancy Feast cat food."

        "content": "Fed up with Brad's (Frank Roberts) on-screen foul-ups, his director, Hilary Jacobs (Kylie Minogue), publicly humiliates him and fires him on the spot in front of onlookers. As he comes hoping for one more chance, she further degrades him in her office, which causes the actor to go berserk, mutilating himself then cutting out her tongue using the modified prop shears as his real-life signature weapon. Before he can harm anyone else, his co-star Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald) gives him a makeshift tracheotomy which ends in Brad being seemingly electrocuted as P.A. man Lossman (Geoff Revell) looks on. But as Brad dies, he curses the perceived source of his misery: the movie Hot Blooded! and all who would work on it. In present-day Australia, Lossman is a teacher using his personal experiences as warnings to his students that any attempts to complete filming or even screening of Hot Blooded! has ended up with lives lost in mysterious and disturbing ways (like a producer being suspiciously electrocuted in an editing room or a director mysteriously discovered with his throat slit). But some of his pupils, seeing the chance as too much of a temptation, decide to finish the film as a graduation grade. They contact Vanessa Turnbill to co-star. When she arrives at the airport she is greeted by Raffy and Hester who take her to a press conference to give the film publicity. Interviewing her, a reporter asks Vanessa if she is worried about the curse on the film. She passes off the question with a joke, saying \"Oh if I die, I get paid extra\". As the crew makes the movie, the Scarman kills most of them, one by one, attacking when they are alone and then hiding the bodies. He also kills two police officers who were investigating the strange events, and the caretaker of the house where the crew was filming. Raffy, Vanessa and Lossman are the last ones alive. Lossman realizes that the Scarman is a supernatural monster and they have to destroy the work print to defeat him. Raffy manages to burn the reels in a fire, and the Scarman is eradicated. In New York, another copy of the movie Hot Blooded! is found and a college teacher decides to show it to her students. As the projection of the film starts, the Scarman comes out of the print."

Nathan and Lucas share the same father, Dan Scott (Paul Johansson), but they live apart: it is suggested that Dan abandoned Lucas and his mother, Karen Roe (Moira Kelly) when Lucas was born, preferring to marry Deb Scott (Barbara Alyn Woods), with whom he had Nathan. Nathan and his team are busted for stealing a school bus. Even though Nathan was driving, his father, Dan, manages to bail him out of trouble, as usual, while other players are suspended. During a drive, Nathan's girlfriend (and Ravens\u2019 cheerleader) Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton), nearly runs over Lucas after becoming distracted at the wheel. Lucas heads for Karen's caf\u00e9, where he has dinner with his mother and his best friend, Haley James (Bethany Joy Lenz). The next day, Keith Scott (Craig Sheffer), Dan's elder brother who is close friends with Karen, asks Whitey Durham (Barry Corbin), the Ravens coach, to let Lucas be part of the team. Keith is positive that the kid deserves it. The coach tells Lucas he can join the Ravens. Nathan then challenges Lucas to a basketball match, with the stipulation that the loser will walk away from the team. Later, Peyton's car breaks down and Lucas comes to her assistance. During a discussion, Lucas relays his history with Dan and Nathan. Lucas shows up at Keith's shop by the time Dan is talking to Keith about Karen. Following this, Lucas makes up his mind and accepts Nathan's challenge. After winning the game, Lucas lets Peyton know that Nathan has to stay on the team because \"it's the last thing he wants\". In the last scene, Lucas enters the school's gym while everyone is staring at him. A last close-up to the park where Lucas used to play: it's finally empty."

I see the entire process as tremendously beautiful and sincerely dream to show the viewers of my movie the true sense of this ongoing phenomenon.A funeral serves as the starting point for this movie. The funeral is for a warm-hearted eighty-seven-year-old lady who had strived to help those in need throughout her life.Through the motif of the funeral, the most extensively scaled ceremony in life, I have tried to explore the meaning of death and its effects shadowing the bereaved. I have also tried to bring to light the sentiments of the survivors: their sorrow, egoism, solemnity and even frivolity. I want to give the viewers who see this film a moment to think about what is truly valuable and precious in our quickly changing world. At this moment, I consider this goal my duty as a director..\"-- Im Kwon-taek"

        "content": "Breaking Bad is  an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. Walter turns to a life of crime, partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by producing and distributing crystal meth to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. According to Gilligan, the title is a Southern colloquialism meaning \"to raise hell\". Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her company. Breaking Bads first season received generally positive reviews, while the rest of its run received unanimous critical acclaim. Since its conclusion, the show has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. It had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. Viewership increased more drastically upon the premiere of the second half of the fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American television. The show received numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, and four Television Critics Association Awards. Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series twice. In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed TV show of all-time. Better Call Saul, a prequel series featuring Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito reprising their Breaking Bad roles, debuted on AMC on February 8, 2015, and has been renewed for a final sixth season. The sequel film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie starring Paul was released on Netflix and in theaters on October 11, 2019."

Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name \"Heisenberg\" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's lives at risk."

        "title": "Breaking Bad_Conception",
        "content": "Breaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who spent several years writing the Fox series The X-Files. Gilligan wanted to create a series in which the protagonist became the antagonist. \"Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades,\" he said. \"When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?\" He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into Scarface. Gilligan believed the concept of showing the full drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other powerful factors to support it, such as strong cinematography and acting. The show title is a Southern colloquialism meaning, among other things, \"raising hell\", and was chosen by Gilligan to describe Walter's transformation. According to Time entertainment editor Lily Rothman, the term has a broader meaning and is an old phrase which \"connotes more violence than 'raising hell' does\u00a0... [T]he words possess a wide variety of nuances: to 'break bad' can mean to 'go wild', to 'defy authority', and break the law, to be verbally 'combative, belligerent, or threatening' or, followed by the preposition 'on', 'to dominate or humiliate'.\" The concept emerged as Gilligan talked with his fellow X-Files writer Thomas Schnauz regarding their current unemployment and joked that the solution was for them to put a \"meth lab in the back of an RV and [drive] around the country cooking meth and making money\". After writing the concept for the show and pilot, Gilligan pitched it to Sony Pictures Television, who became very interested in supporting it. Sony arranged for meetings with the various cable networks. Showtime passed on this, as they had already started broadcasting Weeds, a show with similarities to the premise of Breaking Bad. While his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful, Gilligan later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about Weeds earlier. Other networks like HBO and TNT also passed on the idea, but eventually FX took interest and began initial discussions on producing the pilot. At the same time, FX had also started development of Dirt, a female-centric crime-based drama series, and with three existing male-centric shows already on the network, FX passed up Breaking Bad for Dirt. One of Gilligan's agents spoke to Jeremy Elice, the director of original programming for AMC who was looking for more original shows to add alongside their upcoming Mad Men. Elice was intrigued, and soon a meeting was set up between Gilligan, Elice, and two programming executives. Gilligan was not optimistic about this meeting, fearing they would just put him off, but instead all three showed great interest, and the meeting ended up establishing how AMC would acquire the rights from FX and set the pilot into production. It took about a year following this meeting before Sony had set up the rights with AMC and production could start."

The film is a beautiful description of the problems faced by women in the name of fertility, or in a different sense the urge to have a male child, especially in rural India. Shyam Benegal provides a masterpiece, reflecting on the sorrowful plight of rural Indian women.

        "content": "Elizabeth is living near Boston in 1863 and writes a letter addressing it to \"Dearest\" (no specific addressee), expressing her desire and hope to someday find someone to love with her whole heart and mind; or as she puts it, She places the letter in the secret compartment of her desk. In the year 1998, Scott Corrigan buys the desk at a second-hand furniture store. The store owner tells Scott that the desk had belonged to a Union general (who we may assume is Caleb Denby). While re-conditioning it, he finds the secret compartment and Elizabeth's letter.  He shows it to his mother but not to his fianc\u00e9e.  His mother has a feeling that Scott may actually be able to communicate with Elizabeth across time.  She encourages him to reply to the letter and gives him a postage stamp from the period in which Elizabeth lived, and says he should mail it at the only post office now existing that was there in 1863.  He does so, telling Elizabeth that she should be patient and that someday she will find her true love. Back in 1863, the local letter carrier delivers Scott's letter to Elizabeth who is quite alarmed when she reads its contents.  She immediately goes to her desk and is shocked to find her letter missing from its secret compartment. She then writes back to Scott demanding to know who he is and how he retrieved her letter from its hiding place. In 1998, Scott hears a noise from the desk sounding like a letter had suddenly been dropped into it.  He goes to the secret compartment and is astonished when he finds Elizabeth's second letter.  Scott replies to it and soon Scott and Elizabeth are communicating with each other across time.  During this period, Scott goes to the home where Elizabeth lived 135 years ago, and finds that it is now owned by Clarisse, the granddaughter of Elizabeth's sister.  He learns a bit more about Elizabeth from this visit and in fact, he and Elizabeth sense each other's presence in the home across time.  Scott's and Elizabeth's letters gradually become more personal and affectionate and eventually loving as each begins to fall in love with the other.  They realize however that their love is a hopeless one given that 135 years separate them. Meanwhile, in Elizabeth's time, her father tries to push her into a marriage with a kind but boring upper-class man for whom Elizabeth has no feelings.  Instead Elizabeth meets a Union Army Officer, Caleb Denby, and begins to fall in love with him, while not losing any of her feelings toward Scott.  (We, the audience, see that Caleb is the spitting image of Scott, something that Elizabeth at that point does not know.)  She writes to Scott of her new love, who in turn researches the Denby's name on the Internet, and finds that he was killed at the battle of Gettysburg.  Scott frantically writes to Lizzy, as he has come to call her, and warns her to tell him that he should not go into that battle.  Scottie (as she has come to call him) goes to mail his (as it turns out) last letter at the old post office only to find it on fire.  He barely makes it into the P.O. and mails the letter before it burns down entirely.  Elizabeth receives Scottie's last letter, and Scottie gets out safely from the burning Post Office.  But with the destruction of the P.O., their ability to connect across time is irrevocably broken.  Elizabeth rushes to Gettysburg but arrives too late.  Caleb has been mortally wounded and he tells her he wants to marry her, but then dies in her arms.  When she returns home in grief, she is handed an earlier letter from Scotty which had been misplaced and which she had never seen until now.  In it is a color photo that Scottie sent to her of himself.  She sees it and says, \"of course\" and realizes that Scotty and Caleb are one and the same person, knows that both are now gone to her, and says she'll never forget him. Back in 1998, Scott confesses to his fianc\u00e9e everything about Elizabeth and that he has fallen in love with her.  She reads Elizabeth's letters to Scott and in one of them, not only finds a photo of Elizabeth but one also of Elizabeth and Caleb and immediately sees that Caleb is identical to Scott.  Although, she thinks the whole thing is crazy, she tearfully breaks off her engagement to Scott and leaves.  Scott then visits  the old house one more time, to find that Clarisse has died, the house now left to Maggie, her caretaker and housekeeper.  Maggie gives him an old wooden box, telling him that Clarisse wanted him to have it.  Scott opens it to find Lizzys's poems (they were not in the box before Scotty wrote to her), his letters to her, and a worn but clear color picture of Scotty, shocking Maggie completely.  The scene then turns to the church graveyard in the town where Elizabeth lived.  Scott finds her grave and gravestone, at the bottom of which is carved, \"I never forgot\". The gravestone gives her birth date as 23.3.1834 and death as 7.8.1901 (aged 67). Elizabeth as it turns out never married. At this point, an enthusiastically friendly golden retriever comes over to Scott in the church graveyard, followed by its owner, a young woman named Beth who turns out to be the spitting image of Elizabeth. Scott then realizes the same thing that Elizabeth did in her time; that Scott is the reincarnation of Caleb, and Scott realizes that Beth in 1998 is the reincarnation of Elizabeth. Beth and Scott have a brief friendly conversation after which Beth offers to treat him to a cup of coffee, and they go off together to get to know one another.  The end of the film shows the book of Lizzy's poems featured in a bookstore, having finally been published by Scotty."

Walking in a section of the borough that contains very large, ancient, magnificent mansions about to be torn down, he finds a yard sale of antique furniture from a mansion about to be demolished, and is fascinated by an antique roll-top desk from the 1800s, which he purchases. After getting the desk home, he opens a drawer and finds original stationery from the previous century, along with several old stamps from that period.  He also finds a love letter from a woman named Helen Elizabeth Worley, who lived in the Brooklyn of the 1880s, to a man whom she dreams about, although she is about to be engaged to a man she doesn't love. Enchanted with the letter, he feels compelled to answer Helen, by writing to her using the old stationery, pen and ink, and putting an 1869 stamp on the letter (from his collection) and mailing it at the old \"Wister\" post office, which has been around  since the 19th century in Brooklyn, unchanged by time. He returns home and opens the second drawer, to find to his shock, that Helen has received his letter, and she wishes to know who he is and why he has written to her.  He writes her another letter, describing who he is, and the fact that he lived in the year 1959 and although they have fallen in love with each other, to meet is impossible because of the years between them.  Expecting to receive a final, long love letter from her, he is surprised to find in the bottom drawer, only her picture and the inscription \"I will never forget\". After doing research on her whereabouts, he finally finds her grave in a local cemetery, and on her tombstone is engraved, \"I never forgot\".  Miss Worley had died in 1934."

He is a steadfast family man married to his high school sweetheart Grace, and together they raise two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie. Sam's brother Tommy is a convicted felon who is released from prison a few days before Sam deploys to Afghanistan in October 2007. At a family dinner with Tommy and Sam's parents Hank and Elsie, Maggie reveals to Tommy that Grace dislikes him, and Hank insults Tommy for his time in prison and lack of success compared to Sam. During Sam's tour, his Blackhawk helicopter is shot down while conducting an operation in the Helmand Province, apparently killing all of the Marines aboard. However, Sam and one of the Marines in his command, Joe Willis, have survived and are taken prisoner in a mountain village by Taliban fighters. Assumed to have been killed in action, Sam and Joe are declared dead by the US military. At Sam's funeral, Tommy notices Hank drinking and stops him from driving home with Elsie and the girls in the car. Hank again berates Tommy for his past mistakes and tells him that Sam was a better son. The two argue about which one of them is more to blame for Sam's death. With Sam gone, Tommy attempts to redeem himself in the eyes of his family and convinces some of his friends to help with a kitchen remodel for Grace. As months pass, Hank and Tommy mend their relationship as Tommy matures and continues to help Grace. Grace slowly sheds her previous resentment towards her brother-in-law, aided by his growing paternal connection with Isabelle and Maggie. Grace and Tommy continue to bond over their mutual mourning, culminating in a passionate fireside kiss. They immediately regret it and do not take their attraction any further, though Tommy continues to win the favor of his nieces. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are tortured by their captor and instructed to make videotaped dismissals of the military and their mission, though only Joe cracks. The captors eventually deem him useless and force Sam at gunpoint to beat Joe to death with a lead pipe, which they also record. Sometime later, Sam is rescued by American forces in an attack on the Taliban base holding him, during the rescue, soldiers find the tape of Sam killing Joe and decide to destroy it. Once he returns home, Sam drifts through a cold, paranoid daze and shows signs of severe post-traumatic stress disorder due to the traumatic events he witnessed and committed in Afghanistan. Refusing to explain to his family what happened while he was there, Sam also lies to Joe's widow and claims he does not know how Joe died. His paranoia also leads him to believe Grace cheated on him with Tommy in his absence. During Maggie's 6th birthday party at Hank and Elsie's home, a resentful and jealous Isabelle falsely claims that Tommy and Grace are having an affair and that Grace would rather sleep with Tommy than Sam. After the family returns home, Sam becomes enraged, destroying the newly remodeled kitchen with a crowbar and aiming a Beretta 92 pistol at Tommy, who tries to calm his brother's violent breakdown. The police arrive and enter a standoff in which Sam fires the gun into the air and then holds it to his head, contemplating suicide. He reluctantly surrenders after several pleas from Tommy and Grace. After the police arrest Sam, he is admitted to a mental hospital. Grace visits him and tells him that if he does not tell her what is tormenting him, he will lose her forever. Faced with this decision, Sam finally opens up about the source of his pain, confiding in her that he killed Joe. As Sam and Grace embrace, Sam, in narration, wonders if he will be able to continue living a normal life."

Cynthia Rhodes reportedly served as a dance double for d'Abo. Flying was first screened at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. According to director Paul Lynch, the film had a very strong showing at the festival due to its release in the wake of similar and highly successful films such as Flashdance and Footloose. As a result, leading production company Golden Harvest turned down bids from numerous distributors in favor of releasing the film itself. Flying was released theatrically in its native Canada on 12 September 1986. According to Lynch, Golden Harvest lacked resources as a distributor, so the film's theatrical release was very limited. Sometime after the Canadian theatrical release, Flying was released on video in the United States by Cinema Group Home Video and in Canada by Cineplex Odeon. In the Philippines, the film was released as Love at the Edge on 10 December 1992, with advertisements that capitalized off of Reeves' Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey and Point Break fame. Since Golden Harvest was a Hong Kong company, it never copyrighted Flying, so the film has been released on VHS and DVD from several different distributors and under several different titles."

His neighbors gather to welcome him back for the weekend; the children ask him for extra baseballs or an old glove.

With the small bonus he earned when he signed with the academy some time ago, he has started to build his family a new house\u2014one that has a bigger kitchen for his mom and a separate room for his grandmother. After learning a devastating knuckle curve, Sugar is invited to spring training by the fictional Kansas City Knights. He is assigned to their Single A affiliate in Iowa, the Swing. He is housed by the Higgins family, who take in Swing players every year. Jorge (Rufino), a veteran player and the only other Dominican on the team, also tries to help Miguel learn the ropes. However, despite the Higgins' welcoming efforts and Jorge's guidance, the challenge of Miguel's acceptance into the community is exposed in small ways every day, from his struggle to communicate in the English language to an accident of casual bigotry at a local bar. Miguel's domination on the mound masks his underlying sense of isolation, until he injures himself during a routine play at first. While Miguel is on the disabled list, Jorge, his one familiar connection to home in this strange new place, is cut from the team, never fully regaining his ability following an off-season knee surgery. The new vulnerability of Miguel's injury, coupled with the loneliness of losing his closest friend, force Miguel to begin examining the world around him and his place within it. Pressure mounts when Salvador, a young pitching phenomenon who used to play with Miguel, is brought up from the Dominican Republic to join the team. Miguel's play falters, and the increased isolation begins to take its toll on him. As his dream begins to fall apart, Miguel decides to leave baseball to follow another kind of American Dream. His odyssey finally brings him to New York City, where at first he struggles to find community and make a new home for himself, like so many before him.

Now, he gets transferred to a hill station named Attakatti, near Pollachi. Natesan feels happy as he believes that this will provide him time to spend with Sala. Although Sala feels sad leaving all her relatives, she also goes with Natesan to the hill station. Over there in the hill station, Sala feels lonely and gets bored, and she longs for the life that she had in Karaikudi. Their house is located in a remote place with no friends and neighbors. Natesan also gets busy with work and has very little time to spend with his wife. Slowly, Sala gets psychologically disturbed due to loneliness, and she behaves as if the house is filled with so many people. Also, she breaks the fan, lights, etc. purposefully in their home so that the nearby electrician, Karuppu (Ganja Karuppu), can come to fix them, and at least she gets a chance to speak to someone. She also starts recording all the sounds around her such as birds chirping, etc. and listens to the recordings when alone. One day, she records a neighbour's child's laughter sound following which the child faints. Sala is scared, but the child is saved. Dr. Ramalingam (Jayaram) sees Sala and understands that she is suffering from a disorder and warns Natesan, but he does not take it seriously. One day, Sala consumes too much of sleeping pills to come out of her depression, but Natesan spots her lying in bed and rushes her to the hospital. Sala is saved. Ramalingam explains the disorder to Natesan and mentions that the best cure for her would be to lead a happy life surrounded by relatives. Natesan agrees and moves back to Karaikudi. The movie ends showing Natesan and Sala leading a happy life again."

        "content": "Professional wrestler Robin Ramzinski, better known by his ring name Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson, rose to fame in the 1980s. Now past his prime, Randy wrestles on weekends for independent promotions in New Jersey while working part-time at a supermarket under Wayne, a demeaning manager who mocks Randy's wrestling background. As a regular at a strip club, Randy befriends a stripper named Cassidy who, like Randy, is past her prime. After winning a local match, Randy agrees to a proposed 20th-anniversary rematch with his most notable opponent, \"The Ayatollah\", which Randy hopes could return him to stardom. Randy intensifies his training, which includes steroid injections. After wrestling in a hardcore match, Randy suffers a heart attack backstage and undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery. His doctor informs him that he nearly died and has to stop taking steroids. To make things even worse, the doctor warns Randy not to wrestle anymore, as his heart can no longer handle the stress brought on by it. Reluctantly, Randy decides to retire and begins working a full-time shift at the supermarket's deli counter. At Cassidy's suggestion, Randy visits his estranged daughter Stephanie, whom he had abandoned when she was a child, but she rebuffs him. While helping Randy buy a gift for Stephanie, Cassidy reveals that she has a son. Randy makes romantic advances toward her, which she rejects on the grounds of her job. Later, Randy gives the gift to his daughter and apologizes for abandoning her. The two bond over a visit to a beachfront boardwalk (where he took her as a child) and agree to meet for dinner on the coming Saturday. Randy goes to Cassidy's strip club to thank her, but she once more rejects him, resulting in a heated exchange. Upset, Randy goes to see a wrestling match and finds solace in his wrestling friends. While at a bar with them, he gets drunk, snorts cocaine, has sex with a woman in the women's restroom, then wakes up in her bedroom the next morning. Exhausted, he sleeps the entire next day and misses his dinner with Stephanie. He goes to her house to apologize, but she angrily tells him she never wants to see him again. At the deli counter, a patron recognizes Randy as the wrestler, though he denies it. The customer persists, which agitates Randy, who then cuts his own hand on the slicer and promptly quits on the spot, going into a rampage in the store while hurling abuse at Wayne and the customers. Spurred by the fan's recognition of him and with nothing left, Randy decides to return to wrestling and reschedules the rematch with The Ayatollah. He reconciles with Cassidy, though she begs him not to wrestle because of his heart condition and pleads with him to cancel the match and give the outside world a second chance. However, Randy disregards her advice, explaining to her that he belongs in the ring with his fans and fellow wrestlers who (unlike the rest of society) love and respect him. As he wrestles, Randy begins to feel chest pain and becomes unsteady. The Ayatollah notices this and urges him to initiate the pin. Randy refuses, however, and climbs the top rope for his signature finishing move, a diving headbutt called the \"Ram Jam\". He looks over and sees Cassidy has left. As the crowd cheers his name, and with tears in his eyes, finally realizing that the only people who truly loved him were in fact his beloved fans.  He grants their request and leaps from the top rope, to victory."

Cast is right on target, with Saphir, Crespo and Hassan all playing straight in different ways, yet all ultimately quite believable.\" Critic Elvis Mitchell like the direction Diego Lerman gave the film and wrote, \"Mr. Lerman, an Argentine, gives this story a spareness and is at his best when there is little or no dialogue...The stoic volatility of the opening 10 minutes matures into another movie altogether, one in which a tenderness develops among the threesome as they understand one another.

While driving in his car with his wife and two daughters, he almost runs into a man walking into a cemetery. Tom's vision of the man causes him to have a flashback to a similar incident in his childhood. In 1955, Jean Holman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), is a single mother caring for her two sons, 11-year old Tom (Joseph Mazzello) and 5-year old Gunny (Seth Mumy). Jean's husband is a soldier who was reported missing in action during the Korean War and is presumed dead.  Tom, who deeply misses his father, feels left out of father-son activities (baseball and camping) in the community. Jean is concerned at Gunny's repeated complaints of stomach pains and his medical condition has gone undiagnosed. Further,  While driving one day with Tom and Gunny, Jean accidentally runs into a drifter named Jack McCloud (Patrick Swayze), breaking his leg. Feeling sorry for him, Jean invites Jack and his female dog Betty Jane to stay at her home until his leg has healed. After some initial difficulties in adapting to this new lifestyle, Jack soon finds himself loved by the family, who all want him to stay. Jack starts teaching baseball to Tom and the two of them develop a strong bond. Meanwhile, Gunny believes that there is more to Jack and Betty Jane than meets the eye, and he is determined to find out what. Gunny soon finds out Betty Jane is a genie, not merely a dog. Meanwhile, Jack's bond with the family gets closer and closer, and Tom comes to see Jack as a surrogate father.  At the same time, Tom's baseball coach, Coach Schramka (Jay O. Sanders) recognizes Jack as a former famous baseball player, who disappeared years ago during Second World War. Jack denies it.  Phil sees Jack as a threat, a potential rival for the affections of Jean. Tom too comes to reject Jack after Jack decides to move away when he is healed, leaving Tom to feel himself abandoned by a father a second time. Jean also feels sad with Jack's decision but admits the impossibility of staying with Jack. After Jack says goodbye to Tom, Tom flees on his bike to a nearby hill. Suddenly, Tom changes his mind and heads back to the highway to find Jack getting into a truck before Tom can reach him. On the 4th of July Party, the titular wishes are being fulfilled.  Gunny realizes his wish to fly in the middle of the fireworks, unseen by the public congregated in the park. Tom's wish is fulfilled when his long-lost father is discovered alive, and he returns home after being freed from his imprisonment by the People's Republic of China. Back to present day, adult Tom, enters the cemetery. Tom meets Jack again. He talks with Jack briefly, discovering that Jack's real wish wasn't that Tom's father would come back home, but that Tom would be happy with the family he had. Afterwards, Jack disappears, and a renewed Tom holds his wife close.  Meanwhile, the camera focuses on a tomb with a headstone that reveals that Jack McCloud died on August 6, 1944."

        "content": "In August 1941, Nazi Germany's  are sweeping through Eastern Europe systematically killing European Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local  under orders from the German occupiers. The brothers flee to the Naliboki forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. The brothers encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest and take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the  chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered. The Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies. After a winter of sickness, starvation, attempted mutiny and constant hiding, the camp learns that the Germans are about to attack them in force. The Soviets refuse to help and they evacuate the camp as  Stukas bomb them. A delaying force stays behind, led by Asael, to slow down the German infantry. The defense does not last long; only Asael and a camp member named Sofiya survive to rejoin the rest of the group, who, at the edge of the forest, are confronted with a seemingly impassable marsh. They cross the marsh with only one casualty but are immediately attacked by a German platoon supported by a Panzer III tank. Just as all seems lost, the Germans are assaulted from the rear by a partisan force led by Zus, who has deserted the Soviets to rejoin the group. In the epilogue, it is revealed that the survivors lived in the forest for another two years, building a hospital, a nursery, a school, growing to a total of 1,200 Jews. Original photographs of the participants are shown, including Tuvia in his uniform and their fates are described: Asael was conscripted into the Red Army and was killed in action, never getting to see the child he fathered; Tuvia, Zus and Aron survived the war and emigrated to the United States to form a trucking firm in New York City. The epilogue also states that the Bielski brothers never sought recognition for what they did and that the descendants of the people they saved now number in the tens of thousands."

During the hazing, Bush successfully recalls the names and nicknames of many of the fraternity members, and states that his family's political legacy is one in which he has no interest. After Bush is jailed in New Jersey for rowdiness following a football game, his father, George H. W. Bush states that he will help him, but for the last time. Following his graduation from Yale, Bush takes a job at an oil patch back in Texas, but he quits after a few weeks. In 1971, \"Junior\" reveals his real aspirations in a father-son talk: working in professional baseball. Bush is accepted into Harvard Business School with the help of his father.  After a night of heavy drinking, Bush crashes his car into his family estate and challenges his father to a fistfight. His younger brother, Jeb, stops the fight. In 1977, Bush announces he will run for Congress to represent Texas's 19th district. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, who says that Bush is not a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with the highest number of votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history. In 1986, Bush becomes a born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his relationship with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself, but that he has not yet done anything with his life. Bush becomes a front office executive of the Texas Rangers baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the Gulf War. Although Allied forces win the war within 100 hours, the elder Bush decides not to invade Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein. After his father loses the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton, Bush blames the loss on his decision not to depose Saddam. In 1994, Bush runs for Governor of Texas. Despite his parents' objection to him entering the race, he wins, becoming the 46th governor of Texas on January 17, 1995. In 2000, he makes a successful bid to become President. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Bush labels Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as the \"axis of evil\". In 2002, Bush searches for evidence that Saddam was creating nuclear weapons, and has the army prepared. All of Bush's White House staff supports him except Secretary of State Colin Powell, who states that invading Iraq would destabilize the country. Powell is generally overruled by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who insist that the war would secure the United States' status as sole global superpower while spreading democracy throughout the Middle East. In March 2003, the U.S. invades Iraq and the war appears to be a success, and Bush gives his \"Mission Accomplished\" speech on an aircraft carrier. When it becomes clear that there are no weapons of mass destruction within Iraq, Bush learns that the responsibility for finding them had been relegated far down the chain of command. Bush discovers that Saddam gambled his regime and his life on the assumption that Bush was bluffing. Bush is asked in a White House press conference what mistakes he made as President, a question that leaves him flustered and speechless. That night, Bush has a nightmare in which his father accuses him of ruining his family's legacy, which the elder Bush claims was intended for Jeb. Bush dreams of himself  playing center field at a baseball game. Bush attempts to catch a pop fly, but it disappears."

Stone remarked, \"Christian's a very methodical actor and he has to have the makeup thing work for him.\" (Bale later went on to portray Dick Cheney in 2018's similarly-themed Vice.) Brolin, cast at the \"last minute\", spent months working on Bush's distinctive vocal style, calling hotels in Texas and talking to the people at the front desk, listening to their accents. The actor also watched videos of Bush walking. Brolin said, \"It changes over the years, how he walks in his 30s, how he walks in foreign lands, before 9/11 and afterward.

Dreyfuss and Stone did not get along well during filming, and Dreyfuss was harshly critical of the director during the film's press junket, noting Stone had attacked him right before the tour began. Dreyfuss also told film critic Nathan Rabin in an interview that he did empathize with the former Vice President, calling him \"true to himself\", and saying that the real villain of W. was the American public, because it never responded with outrage to the Bush Administration's actions."

Gaines and Belgrave do not believe Gloria's death to be suicide based on information from Gaines' girlfriend, Nicole, a call girl.   But they cannot close the case.

        "content": "Opening on a sunny high school, birds chrip, flags fly, and school mascots fight. A blonde woman arrives to end Andrew (the mascot)'s fight. The woman is Becky Freeley, the school's guidance counselor. Becky cheerfully intones that she knows exactly how difficult high school can be. She meets with kids like Russell\u00a0\u2013 who's failing remedial PE and may or may not have head lice. But she claims to love the kids, and that they love her back. She strolls past a group of African Americans, cluelessly spouting, \"What's the haps, peeps?\" She later swipes a Danish from a chunky girl, saying that it may fill the hole in her mouth, but \"not the hole in her soul.\" Chris \"Bruce\" Parnell, the school's vice principal scuttles up to Becky. He is insulted because Becky's been made chair of the Homecoming dance.  When Bruce is in charge, dances are held at 10:00 A.M. on Wednesdays. Bruce is pretty sure that if she doesn't crack down, the school dance is going to turn into a scene from 28 Days Later. As he tries to convince her to hire security, Becky comes to a dead stop. She spots Tim, a male teacher who helps an old lady pick up dropped books, and it is shown Becky loves Tim. Becky shakes herself and tells Bruce that she's got chaperones. Namely, Tim. Becky figures that the next logical step is for Tim to ask her to be his date to the dance. The competition doesn't stand a chance, especially since it consists of Miss Kinney (a woman with a lesbian attire) Miss Fukui (grim-looking Trunchbull type) and the Lunch Lady (all jowls in a stylish ensemble of Halloween sweater and hairnet). Bruce smirks that he'll be waiting in the wings for Becky's dance to fail. Becky remembers how when she was in high school, she wasn't as beautiful as she is now. She had fanny packs, headgear, frizzy hair, and chest-high acid-washed jeans. Becky admits she wasn't exactly popular, but she had many interests and friends. She hung out with a kid in a wheelchair who \"felt sorry for her and thought she might put out.\" Becky thinks the principal offered her this job because of her qualifications. However, it's shown he really hired her because of her new looks. However, Becky's former classmate, Lisa Germain, is also teaching at the school as an English teacher. Lisa, like Becky (if not, more) is stunning, and happened to be the most popular girl in Becky's graduating class. Lisa only remembers Becky as \"that girl who vomited during the safe sex assembly.\" It's shown the two are not on good terms, starting a rivalry. Becky talks to Shane, a student insecure about the dance. Becky recalls her own homecoming, which was a disaster as her date never showed up. Shane wants advice about asking a girl to the dance. He doesn't want to make a fool of himself. It is now shown Becky's awkwardness extends into her counseling sessions. Becky begins breakdancing around her office to the tune of \"Push It\". When she's done, she asks if the \"advice\" was helpful. Shane demurs, saying that this woman is older than anyone he's ever dated. As he speaks, he's shyly fingering the name plaque on her desk. So of course, Becky thinks he's talking about her. The bell rings, sparing him the embarrassment of her turning him down. However, he really is crushing on someone else. In the teacher's lounge, Becky embarrasses herself in front of Tim. Tim is worried about being taken seriously as a teacher. He replaced the old Spanish teacher, who was fired after his hard drive was seized by the FBI. Tim, who used to be the Auto Shop teacher, took the job because he wanted to be more than a grease monkey. Plus, there was nobody else (they offered the job to the janitor, but he didn't want anybody poking around on his hard drive). Now Tim's just one Spanish lesson ahead of the very students he's teaching. Becky tells him that a student has a crush on her, but it wouldn't be right for her to go to the dance with him. Going with another faculty member, though, would be alright. Lisa Germain flirtatiously introduces herself to Tim, embarrasses Becky by talking about her orthodontia issues in high school, then strikes up a way-too-easy conversation with Becky's man. In her office, Becky's furious when the principle arrives, and asks her to be his date. Fortunately, Becky's saved by the arrival of a student. Later, the preparations for the dance are almost complete, but Tim hasn't asked her. She'd advise a female student in this situation to ask the him herself, but she'd never do that, because she thinks it would make her look desperate. The next morning, Tim casually rolls into the staff parking lot. Becky, following him, offers to share homemade enchiladas for lunch and talk about the dance. He agrees, but just then Lisa drives into the lot in a classic convertible. Tim admires the car, which promptly breaks down. The scene changes to the nurse fixing Becky's show after she helped Tim push Lisa's disabled palm. Bruce arrives to insist that she use his security detail for the dance, and Becky relents. It's shown in high school that Bruce was the one bullies would bully. Becky's shrieking Tim's name banshee-style down the school hallway at lunchtime. He bails on their enchilada date because he has to study for a parent teacher conference. Becky's eating the enchiladas on her own when Shane comes in. She tells him that certain feelings may develop in therapeutic situations. A confused Shane clarifies that he wants to ask out a girl named Allison, who's a senior. He also reveals a friend of his asked Lisa out to the dance, but found out Lisa was going with Tim. A flashback shows it may be because of Todd Collins all over again\u00a0\u2013 Lisa's high school boyfriend, whom Becky liked. Later, Tim apologizes for missing lunch. Turns out that Lisa's the one who asked him to the dance.  He doesn't look particularly excited about it. Becky sighs that she'll see him at the dance, and even manages to make a wistful little joke about somebody having a baby in the bathroom. Becky gets dropped off by her mom, who has a date and needs to borrow the car. Rather than going inside, Becky decides to crawl GI Jane-style through the bushes to peer through the gym windows and spy on Lisa and Tim. Everything's peachy until she looks over, and discovers it's Russell, the boy with head lice. Becky finally gives him decent advice: everyone has to grow up at their own pace. Russell thanks her, then asks, if he can touch her breast, to which she calmly replies \"No sweetie\". With leaves from the bushes sticking out of her hair, Becky says some people think she doesn't have time for a life of her own. But now that her dad has run off, her mom needs her. Becky gets offered a ride home by the nerdish girl whose outfit matches hers. But just then she sees Lisa and Tim coming out of the gym. Becky runs away, trips, and falls spectacularly down behind a parked car. There, she crouches and hides as Lisa and Tim talk nearby. Lisa cries about how hard it is for her to be single, but Tim says she's not alone\u00a0\u2013 he and Becky are single, too.  Lisa laughs that Becky's desperation is kind of pathetic. Tim proves that he's a truly awesome guy by saying he knows she can be awkward at times, but that's why he's so impressed. Becky's always so positive. The next day, Bruce is his usual snappish self about Becky's absence at the dance. She tells him she was there, helping out Russell. She dreamily looks out the window and, seeing Tim walking up to the school, sighs that she loves her job. It's like her car. Her whole life she wanted that car, and now she can't believe she's so lucky. Right about then, a taxi backs into said car in the parking lot. Becky takes a sip of tea, trying to suppress the nervous twitch I think she may be developing."

Quinn places a box on the table, revealing a huge diamond, and says,   \"I stole it.\" The reporter, suddenly enthralled, assumes that Quinn has been in prison for the theft all this time. The story then flashes back to 1960, when Quinn was still employed as a manager at London Diamond Corporation. She is passed over for a promotion for the sixth time despite being intellectually superior to her male co-workers. Quinn discovers she is due to be fired from the janitor, Mr. Hobbs. He offers her a place in a plot: stealing enough diamonds to make them rich, but not enough to be noticed. Knowing she is considered old by her coworkers and has few other professional prospects, she agrees. At a social event at the Company President's mansion, she finds the vault combination codes. On shakes terms, Quinn and Mr. Hobbs hatch a plan, exploiting a weakness in the new camera security system. However, Mr. Hobbs manages to lift every single diamond from the vault, almost two tons worth, and by way of a proxy, holds them for a ransom of 100 million pounds. The head of the insurance syndicate from King's Row is forced to pay the ransom, leaving him financially ruined. Quinn, having never agreed to this, now finds herself trapped. The company hires a private investigator, Mr. Finch, to keep the matter from going public. Suspicious from the start, Finch keeps a close eye on Mr. Hobbs and Quinn. Quinn seeks to avoid capture and jail by giving the diamonds back but Mr. Hobbs refuses to negotiate. Having no idea where he has hidden them, she conceals their scheme while assisting Finch with the investigation. The situation escalates when the diamonds are not returned, the incident is leaked to the Press. The president of London Diamond Corporation has a heart attack due to the stress. Feeling cornered while out for a drink with Finch, Quinn runs to the bathroom and cries uncontrollably. After losing her diamond earring down the drain, she gets an idea as to how the heist could have been pulled and where the diamonds could be. After Finch excuses himself, she goes down into the sewers under the company and finds Mr. Hobbs guarding a passage. He pulls a gun on her, but she finds a huge pile of diamonds at her feet. Mr. Hobbs confesses he has no interest in the diamonds or the money and wants to ruin the head of the insurance syndicate whose deliberate delay in covering his wife's medical expenses resulted in her death many years before. Once the deadline for the ransom has passed, resulting in the insurance head's suicide, Mr. Hobbs leaves. Quinn finds the rest of the diamonds and calls Finch claiming she followed a hunch. While there is questionable proof she was involved in the incident, Finch is unwilling to press charges against Quinn. The company recovers the stolen property and implies to the press the theft was just a rumour. The story returns to the present. Quinn tells the reporter she resigned and shortly after received a letter from a bank in Switzerland. Mr. Hobbs apologized for involving her, needing a disgruntled employee for access to the diamond vault, and as compensation gave her the ransom money. Quinn details how she spent the rest of her life donating all the unspent money to many different organizations and people in need. She has returned to London after a long absence only to tell the story and leave the diamond she found in the sewer, calling it the last reminder of the woman she was."

        "content": "After Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) gives Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) a warning about his job performance, Jim tries to land his biggest client ever (Phil Reeves). He takes the potential client golfing, bringing along co-workers Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner). When Jim tries to talk business, the client reveals that he is not interested in switching paper suppliers. But after much persistence and negotiation, Jim lands the account. Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) set up a booth at a local job fair to find a student for Dunder Mifflin\u2019s summer internship but while other companies are prepared and have provided materials and products for their booth, Michael only brought a single white piece of Dunder-Mifflin paper. The fair proves unsuccessful, as Michael drives away the only interested student, Justin (Trevor Einhorn) because Justin is not cool enough for him. After everyone else either ignores the booth or tells Michael off, Michael tries to recruit Justin as their intern, only for Justin to call Michael out for treating him badly and walk away. Michael then makes such a commotion that the teacher (Lori Murphy Saux) calls security and has him removed from the fair. After, Pam ventures to a booth advertising graphic design, where she discovers that she has yet to learn many graphic design programs. The man working at the booth recommends she goes to either Philadelphia or New York City to learn about the graphic design technology. Meanwhile, Michael has left Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) in charge of the office, but none of the employees obey his wishes. When most of the employees leave in the middle of the day, Dwight is left alone except for ex-girlfriend Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), causing the two to interact awkwardly for the rest of the day.  When Jim and Pam meet up again in the office, they share two long, passionate kisses having accomplished both of their goals (Jim making the sale and Pam finding out the next step for her future in graphic design)."

        "content": "This episode was the third episode of the series directed by Tucker Gates. Gates had previously directed the third season episodes \"Branch Closing\" and \"Women's Appreciation\". \"Job Fair\" was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg. In order to create the blisters that Andy had on his hands during the episode, the make-up crew had to use Ben Nye sunburn colors, RCMA scar making material, and acetone. The process took twenty to thirty minutes, in which the sunburn colors were applied first and the scar making material was applied last. Angela Kinsey was pregnant during shooting. Her character wasn't pregnant, so items (such as a copy machine) were placed between her stomach and the camera to hide her pregnancy. Writer Lee Eisenberg recalled that during editing \"I asked if we had any wider shots. Both Gene (Stupnitsky) and Dave Rogers (the editor) reminded me that we were shooting around Angela's enormous belly\". Kinsey later gave birth on May 3, five days before the episode premiered."

The film focuses on the relationship that develops between Willie Esterhuyse and Thabo Mbeki. The secret talks were brokered by Michael Young, a British businessman who worked for Consolidated Gold Fields, a firm with considerable interests in South Africa. The talks took place in Mells Park House, a country house near Frome in Somerset. The house was then owned by Consolidated Gold Fields. Consolidated Gold Fields was a company with interests in South Africa which is the subject of sanctions by other nations. In one scene, Young and Rudolf Agnew, chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, leave their offices in London and are mobbed by anti-apartheid protesters who batter and chase their car, unaware that the two men are sponsoring the very talks that are leading to the end of the system they oppose. In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on 24 April 2009, Michael Young mentioned how he had been asked by Thabo Mbeki to write the final chapter of the 2003 book by Robert Harvey on the Fall of Apartheid, the chapter titled \"Endgame\", on which this film is based."

        "content": "Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is planning a going-away party for Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) before he leaves for Costa Rica. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is extremely happy that Toby is leaving, but when Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) balks at his unreasonable party demands, Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) accepts the duty of planning the party. She does fantastically, ordering carnival rides and hiring a band. Michael's hatred of Toby has been transferred to the new human resources representative, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and he and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly falls in love with her. Taking advice from Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. During the interview, Pam helps Toby finally get revenge against Michael by making him give up his favorite watch to Toby after discovering he planned on giving him a rock for a going away gift. Dwight, however, continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) reveals that she is spending the summer studying graphic design at Pratt Institute in New York City, which she got accepted at. Meanwhile, Jim calls Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) about a huge sale that he has recently made. Patronizing as ever, Ryan instructs him to enter the sale on the company's website before abruptly hanging up. Jim takes this as another sign that Ryan is trying to push him out of the company, and leaves Ryan a voice mail proclaiming that he will fight Ryan's attempts to fire him. Shortly afterward, Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) and Jim find a video on YouTube of Ryan being arrested for fraud in the full presence of his peers who are all recording his arrest on their cell phones and interrupt Toby's exit interview to show Michael, Toby, Pam, and Holly. In an interview, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) reveals that Ryan's website was floundering, so he double-counted office sales as website sales, fraudulently inflating the firm's figures. Although Michael is deeply concerned for Ryan, Jim is pleased and leaves Ryan a second voice mail mockingly telling Ryan to disregard the last because he had his \"hands tied.\" Michael discovers that Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) has artificially inseminated herself from a sperm bank when Kevin runs into her at the grocery store. She explains that she did this while she was dating Michael, but still wants him to be involved in the pregnancy. He initially is indecisive, but eventually calls and agrees to attend Lamaze class with her. Jim contributes several hundred dollars to the party-planning fund in order to buy fireworks, later revealing that he has decided to propose to Pam, going back to their \"first date\". Pam notices the purchase and guesses his intentions; however, at the party, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) ruins the moment by proposing to Angela, who bitterly accepts. Pam is visibly disappointed that Jim didn't propose to her. Michael has security escort Toby out of the office as a parting insult. Dwight is crushed that his ex-girlfriend is marrying someone else. In the last scene of the episode, Phyllis returns to the office, pleased at the success of her party, where she and the camera crew walk in on Angela and Dwight having sex on Angela's desk."

        "title": "Goodbye, Toby_Production",
        "content": "\"Goodbye, Toby\" was written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta. Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson. It took Lieberstein and Celotta four or five days to write this episode. Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was inspired by the days that he was an administrative assistant for Countrywide Home Loans. Farrell recalled watching the company try new online initiatives and seeing them all be unsuccessful. \"Goodbye, Toby\" was the seventh episode of the series directed by Paul Feig. Feig had previously directed \"Office Olympics\", \"Halloween\", \"Performance Review\", \"Email Surveillance\", \"Survivor Man\" and \"Dinner Party\". Feig was tasked with shooting many of the shots that would hide Angela Kinsey's pregnant stomach. To do this, he \"looked for places around the office that could conceal her belly\". Notably, the ending of the episode was shot in such a way that the audience could see that Dwight and Angela were having sex, but that Kinsey's stomach would not be seen. The talking head interview wherein Michael compares Holly to a baker came after what the writers call \"blitzes\", in which all the writers write a talking head on a specific topic, such as \"Michael's feelings to Holly\". Then they all read all of them out loud and see which one gets the biggest reaction. The YouTube video of Ryan being arrested was set on a private account. After \"Goodbye, Toby\" aired, the video was released to the public. When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character. After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes. The script also included an un-filmed scene in which Jan reveals to Michael that her sperm donor was Andy Roddick. \"Goodbye, Toby\" introduced Holly Flax, played by Amy Ryan, who would go on to become Michael's main love interest. In fact, her return to the series in the seventh season was used by the writers as a way to write Steve Carell out of the series after his contract ended. Ryan gained prominence with her role as Beadie Russell on the HBO series The Wire. The writers of The Office, who were fans of the series, then approached Ryan about appearing in their show. Ryan, feeling that a comedy series would \"keep [her] a couple steps ahead of people [and] surprise people\" agreed. Holly's character was developed by the writers awhile before the episode was scripted. However, once Ryan began acting on set, Lieberstein explained that \"we started to see this really silly side that Amy brought to the character, and [we] found almost like a junior Michael in her. And we all saw it and knew what we had.\" After the filming of \"Goodbye, Toby\", the writers were hoping that Ryan would return for the fifth season; the crew had not made a deal with her to film more episodes, but Lieberstein noted that \"we knew that she would stay around, or we hoped.\" The episode also guest starred Melora Hardin, and Robert R. Shafer. The members of Darryl's band are the actual members of actor Craig Robinson's band: Chris Rob played bass, Asa Watkins played drums, and David Sampson played guitar. The Season Four DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael comparing Toby to the flu, Holly asking Pam if Kevin just ate before jumping in the bounce castle, Jim not sure whether Ryan is going to downsize him, Jim and Pam browsing for apartments online, the revelation that Kevin's band, Scrantonicity played 30 full Police songs during Phyllis's wedding, Kelly watching Ryan's YouTube arrest video over and over again at Jim's desk, Jim asking about the website, and Troy (Noel Potek)\u2014Ryan's drug dealer\u2014showing up in Scranton. In one deleted scene, in which Toby gives a \"farewell\" speech that is interrupted by Michael, Toby pleads with the Dunder Mifflin staff to continue his fight to have the office checked for Radon; this scene foreshadows the Season 6 episode \"The Chump\", in which Toby sets numerous Radon test kits around the office."

Despite putting up with the noise for years, including the formative years of his daughter, he finally breaks into a car to shut off its alarm, and is arrested by police. Owen and his family try living in the countryside for a weekend, but it only replaces one set of noise problems with another. Despite attempting to legally deal with the constant barrage of noise, he makes no progress, and continues to resort to vandalism, resulting in higher and higher court penalties and straining his relationship with his wife, who finally asks him to leave. While living on his own, Owen continues to destroy alarms, and progressively damages cars based on the number of violations. During this, he meets and begins a relationship with Ekaterina, a Russian student. She confronts him with the fact that he is \"The Rectifier\", a vigilante personality, complete with monikered stickers, that Owen has adopted. After falling in with him, Ekaterina convinces Owen to start a ballot initiative. While initially slow, the measure garners explosive popularity. Despite this, it is shut down by Mayor Schneer, who disdains the Rectifier and believes supporting the measure would encourage vigilantism. After being shut down through a loophole that prevents the ballot measure from appearing, Owen outfits a car with numerous alarms and much louder horns. He then parks in front of city hall and sets off his alarms, citing the various laws that so frustrated Owen initially when city hall security demands he turn them off. After enraging a nearby tenant, Judge Kornreich, his vehicle is attacked and the judge is mistakenly arrested as The Rectifier. Kornreich sues Owen for pain and suffering damages, and Owen goes to court. During his cross-examination of Kornreich, Owen intentionally alludes that his actions could be considered assault and battery, establishing a legal precedent. Owen is found guilty, though Kornreich obviously intends to be lenient on him. Having won a legal victory, Owen reunites with his wife. Walking out of the courthouse, an activist approaches Owen about blowing up a billboard TV that has been causing accidents and is an eyesore of the cityscape. A dual ending is provided, one in which Owen flees with the activist, and one where he politely declines to accompany her and gets into a cab with his wife."

        "content": "The idea of Sons came directly from the two sons of the Li family, Li Ji and Li Wei. According to Zhang, the two sons literally knocked on his door and immediately claimed that they were both the \"baddest family on the block\" and that their father, who had been committed to a mental institute, was also \"awesome.\" Fascinated by this seemingly contradictory account of the Li family, Zhang agreed to make a film based on their story. In contrast to the sons, the parents of Li Ji and Li Wei were not in favor of making a film, and never fully accepted the idea of their lives being put down on film. Shooting Sons required Zhang to simply film the Li family as they interacted with each other. In the process, Zhang became very comfortable with the family, to the extent that they would forget that cameras were around. Zhang relates one instance where the family's argument got so out of hand that Zhang had to intervene before the \"actors\" injured each other."

        "content": "In 1961 London, Jenny Mellor is a bright and beautiful 16-year-old schoolgirl who wishes to attend Oxford University. Her studies are controlled by her strict, overbearing father, Jack. After youth orchestra rehearsals, Jenny waits at a bus stop on the street in the rain when she meets David Goldman, a seductive older Jewish man driving a Bristol 405. Telling her that he is a music lover and that he is worried about her cello getting wet, David convinces Jenny to put her cello in his car while she walks alongside. As the rain becomes stronger, Jenny asks David if she can sit inside his car. The two continue talking about music and, before being dropped off, Jenny confesses that she will be able to do whatever she wants when she reaches university, such as going to art galleries and watching French films, wishing for a life of culture and luxury. The following week, David leaves flowers on Jenny's front porch, wishing her luck at her youth orchestra's concert. Later, she sees him outside the cafe she and her friends are in and approaches him. After a little small talk, David asks Jenny if she is free to go see a concert and have supper with him and his friends. She happily agrees and thanks him. On the night of the concert, Jack disapproves of Jenny going while her much more lenient mother, Marjorie, tells him otherwise. David comes by to pick Jenny up and to talk to her parents, where he easily charms his way into convincing Jack that he take Jenny home later than her intended curfew. They arrive at the concert where Jenny meets David's friends, Danny and Helen. Afterward, they go to dinner at a fancy restaurant, where they invite Jenny to an art auction. David picks up Jenny at school and they go to the auction, winning a bid for a painting by Edward Burne-Jones and going to Danny's place afterwards. They talk about Oxford and they all agree to go and visit together the following weekend. Jenny hears a commotion late one night and sees David drinking with her parents. He then uses the opportunity to ask them if he can take Jenny to Oxford, saying that he used to study there and would like to visit his old teacher, Clive Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. Her parents are reluctant at first, but agree, seeing it as a good opportunity. At Oxford, Jenny discovers that David is a con man who makes money through a variety of shady practices. She is initially shocked but silences her misgivings as she succumbs to David's charm. Back at her home, Jenny and David have their first kiss. Jenny then shows a signed copy of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to her parents, which David actually signed. Impressed by his connections and charisma, Jack and Marjorie approve of their romantic relationship. On the night of Jenny's 17th birthday, David arrives with presents and tells her parents that he intends to take her to Paris as a special birthday gift. Her father angrily disapproves, but later agrees after David talks to him. In Paris, the two dance, take photos, and Jenny eventually loses her virginity to David. Back in London, Jenny gives her favorite teacher, Miss Stubbs, Chanel perfume as a gift from her trip. Miss Stubbs refuses the gift, telling Jenny that she knows where it came from and is both concerned and disapproving of her relationship with David. They argue and have a falling-out. Later that night, David proposes marriage. Jenny accepts the proposal and, after an argument with the headmistress, decides to drop out of school and not apply to university. While getting petrol on their way to dinner with her parents, Jenny rummages through the car's glove compartment for a cigarette and discovers, through letters, that David is already married. Shocked, Jenny tells David to take her and her parents back home. Jenny argues with David, telling him she gave up her education to be with him. David says he will get a divorce and agrees that he will go and tell her parents the truth with her. She then goes inside her house, her father asking what happened. Jenny tells her parents that David is mustering up the courage before going inside to confront them. However, he drives off and is never seen again. Jenny despairs, blaming Danny and Helen for not telling her the truth early on and blaming her parents for letting her throw her life away with an older man. Jenny confronts David's wife, and learns that David has a son and is a serial adulterer. Later that night, Jack apologizes to Jenny, admitting that he messed up and that he believed David could give her the life she wanted. Jack points out that although David wasn't who he said he was, Jenny had also deceived her parents about David's nature by playing along with some of David's lies to her parents. Jenny then goes back to her school, requesting to repeat her last year and take her exams, but is refused re-admission. She then goes to Miss Stubbs, asking for help. She resumes her studies and is accepted at Oxford the following year. In a closing voiceover, Jenny shares a story about dating boys her age and starting over with fresh eyes, despite her experiences with David."

He has also just been fired from his job as a health inspector when he discovers his father Nat (Christopher Walken), a cheap con-man, has a terminal brain tumor and he wants to see Richie. Richie, believing it's another con, grudgingly goes to Atlantic City to see his father who explains he has been living on five dollars a day, going to extremes to do so, such as constantly calling various radio station contests with different aliases to win things, like concert tickets he can then scalp. Nat shows Ritchie an x-ray of his skull, and asks Ritchie to drive him to New Mexico to seek a potential cure. The father and son hit the road driving a Sweet'n Low car free of charge provided they get gas at Chevron stations along the way. Richie calls his girlfriend to tell her about his life and the trip, using one of Nat's many free cell-phones with promotional minutes. After their first stop to eat at an IHOP restaurant for free by Nat convincing them it's his birthday using a fake drivers license (which Nat continues to do at other IHOPs along the way), they stop at a vacant house that is for sale to spend the night, and narrowly avoid being found out by a realtor and some people looking at the home the following morning. The next day over a stolen room service meal from a motel, Richie finds out that Nat got him fired by telling his boss of an earlier jail sentence, which is later revealed that Richie took the fall for to keep Nat from going to jail for one of his crimes. This almost makes Richie abandon the trip. They proceed to drive to various cities, once staying at an open house for a retirement village. They then go to Amarillo, Texas, where they meet up with Richie's old babysitter, Dolores (Sharon Stone), who is now a professional model Nat has a thing for. They then head to New Mexico so that Nat can collect a small sum of money from an old rival, Kruger (Peter Coyote), whom Nat lent money to start a used car dealership many years back, and whom Richie's mother later ran off with when he was young. Kruger, now owner of a hugely successful chain of car dealerships, and a well established member of the community with wife and family, agrees to give Nat a large sum of quiet money so that Nat does not upset Kruger's plans to run for mayor by embarrassing Kruger regarding Ritchie's paternity. Flush with cash, Nat suggests to Richie that the two of them visit Las Vegas to spend some time together, but Richie soon realizes that Nat is not his actual father and Nat convinces him that his story about being sick was a ruse to get him to travel with him to New Mexico. Upset with this news, Richie runs off with the hush money and sneaks into Kruger's campaign kick-off party to confront him. Not satisfied with how Kruger responds, Richie rushes the campaign stage to announce Kruger's paternity and simulates the return of the hush money. After escaping capture by campaign security, Richie returns to the hotel where he meets back up with Nat. After some discussion, Nat collapses and winds up in the hospital, actually very ill. Maggie shows up after Richie calls her to break the news. They sneak Nat out of the hospital, and Nat takes Richie to a beached boat house near the shore of a desert lake, where the two go skinny dipping. Later, Richie and Maggie are shown sitting in a row boat on the lake, scattering Nat's ashes from a makeshift urn consisting of a large Pepsi cup that Nat got for free with a five dollar purchase of gas. The boat begins to sink as they laugh at their circumstance."

While Dora was pregnant with Marco, Carlo, an abusive heroin addict, was thought to have committed suicide at sea after his boat was found adrift. The incident resulted in Dora having a nervous breakdown and being placed in psychiatric care. With Bruno away as a commercial airline pilot, Dora is left all alone with Marco and only her shattered memory of the events of her former husband's death, caused by extensive electroshock treatment she received while institutionalized. Marco experiences various strange occurrences in the home, and is inexplicably drawn to the home's basement. Dora notices bizarre changes in Marco's personality, and is disturbed to find he has shredded her underwear. Unnerved by Marco's behavior and other frightening occurrences, Dora pleads with Bruno that they move out of the house, but he ignores her. While Bruno is on a flight, Dora finds a bundle of roses with a note addressed to her from Carlo. Suspecting Marco wrote it as a twisted joke, she confronts him, and slaps him in the face when he denies writing it. Dora brings Marco to her psychologist friend, Aldo Spidini, for examination. Aldo suggests that Dora's trauma from her marriage to Carlo may be triggering her to project feelings of spite or anger on Marco, though she confesses that she feels that Marco is being possessed by his deceased father. One afternoon, Dora finds the piano playing by itself, and witnesses drawings in Marco's room begin levitating, but is unable to find Marco. She eventually comes upon him in the den, and he asks her why she killed his father. This triggers a repressed memory, in which Dora recounts how she stabbed Carlo to death after he forcibly injected her with heroin and LSD. Distraught over the recollection, Dora is assured by Bruno that Carlo killed himself, and that her memory is only a delusion, but she remains steadfast that Carlo is haunting the home and possessing Marco. Dora awakens in the middle of the night from a nightmare to banging noises emanating from the basement. She investigates the noises, and finds Bruno smashing down a brick wall. Realizing Carlo's corpse has been hidden behind the wall, Dora is told by Bruno that she called him for help after murdering Carlo seven years ago. Wanting to save her from prison, Bruno hid Carlo's body in the house and released his boat to sea, staging his disappearance as a possible suicide. Bruno explains that they had to return to the home so that Carlo's remains wouldn't have been discovered, which would have happened had they sold it; he then tells her once he has transferred the remains elsewhere, they can leave. In an abrupt but frenetic blind rage, Dora swings a pickaxe at Bruno, impaling him in the chest and subsequently stuffs his corpse in the open wall along with Carlo's. Dora runs upstairs to search for Marco, but finds a ghoulish apparition of Carlo lying in his bed. Then in the hallway, Marco subsequently appears and starts running towards her, but suddenly transforms into Carlo as he embraces her causing Dora to scream with terror. Dora tries to flee from the house but encounters violent poltergeist activity that prevents her from doing so. She returns to the basement, where she inexplicably slashes her own throat with a boxcutter while hallucinating. Outside, Marco sits at a table in the backyard of the house, having tea with his father's invisible ghost."

        "content": "Following a series of failed ventures or incomplete works such as Rabid Dogs and Baby Kong, Mario Bava's son Lamberto Bava continued to push his father into making new film work, which led to the creation of Shock. The original script for Shock was written by Dardano Sacchetti and Francesco Barbieri in the early 1970s following their work on A Bay of Blood. The script's original title was Al 33  di via Orologio fa sempre freddo (\"It's always cold at 33 Clock Street\"), and was loosely based on the novel The Shadow Guest by Hillary Waugh. In 1973, Bava did pre-production work for this script with Mimsy Farmer doing a screen test for the leading part. This project was later shelved. Lamberto Bava would later return to the script and worked on it with Rabid Dogs co-writer Alessandro Parenzo, who was credited in the film as Paolo Brigenti. Lamberto stated that he and Sacchetti wanted to make a \"modern\" horror film, and were inspired by the works of Stephen King. The film went into production in 1977 and was shot over a period of five weeks. Mario let Lamberto direct some scenes in the film based on Mario's storyboards. Lamberto's official credit for directing is \"Collaboration to the direction.\" The musical score in the film was composed by the group Libra, with Carlo Pennisi on guitar, Alessandro Centofanti on keyboards, Dino Cappa on bass, and Walter Martino on drums. It was the group's last recording before breaking up later that year."

        "content": "\"Three of a Kind\" is the twentieth episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network on May 2, 1999 in the United States. The episode was written by Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, and directed by Bryan Spicer. The episode is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \"Three of a Kind\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.2, being watched by 12.9 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with some noting that the episode served as a stop-gap. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, The Lone Gunmen run into the enigmatic Susanne Modeski. After deceiving Scully into joining them, the trio soon find out that Susanne's fianc\u00e9 is planning to use her new brainwashing drug for political assassinations. \"Three of a Kind\" functions as a sequel of sorts to the fifth season episode \"Unusual Suspects\", concluding the story of The Lone Gunmen and Susanne Modeski, the woman who led to the creation of the trio. While Mulder played a supporting role in \"Unusual Suspects\", the concept is reversed in \"Three of a Kind\", with Scully helping out The Lone Gunmen."

Unbeknownst to Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) and Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood), Byers is still harboring an attraction to Susanne Modeski, a fellow conspirator who mysteriously disappeared almost ten years ago. Byers hopes that he will meet her at the convention. The Lone Gunmen cleverly trick Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) into coming to Las Vegas using a text to speech program. Their friend Jimmy uses his special technique for gaining access to a secret meeting room where he believes he will learn about new assassination techniques employed by the government. However, Jimmy is discovered and injected with a mystery drug which forces him to kill himself. Meanwhile, Byers discovers that Susanne is alive and well, but has seemingly become a secretive government agent. Scully is performing Jimmy's autopsy when she is attacked by an agent who injects something into her, causing her to collapse. After being confronted by Byers, Susanne reveals that she is pretending to have switched sides so she, along with her fiancee Grant Ellis, can slow progress on the government's harmful initiatives. She works alongside the Gunmen to set up Grant, whom she discovers has been lying to her. Timmy, the late Jimmy's friend, asks Langly to attend a Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly with a drug that effectively controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her, including Morris Fletcher. He takes her back to the suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as \"anoetic histamine\". She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal. Susanne counteracts the weapon's effect on Scully as Langly returns. Langly reports to Timmy the next morning and is given his instructions: enter the meeting room using the provided pass and fire three rounds into Susanne Modeski. Scully attempts to enter the meeting hall but is stopped by security outside. Langly draws a gun and shoots Susanne Modeski three times in the chest during the break. Scully comes in with the guard and has him call for an ambulance. Byers and Frohike arrive as the EMTs and take her away on a stretcher. It is revealed that Susanne realized Langly had been injected and counteracted the drug's effect on him. Together, Scully, Susanne, and the Lone Gunmen orchestrated an elaborate ruse to allow Susanne to escape. Unfortunately the ruse fails, as Timmy Landau tastes the \"blood\" on the floor and realizes it is just corn syrup. Grant Ellis is taken to Susanne Modeski by Scully so she can confront him about why he gave the drug to the government. She is furious as she could have been killed had she not checked Langly the night before. Ellis admits that he only betrayed her because the government threatened his own life. Timmy arrives, guns down Grant Ellis, and takes Susanne to the Lone Gunmen's suite. Timmy prepares to gun down Langly and Frohike, but is injected with the mind control drug by Byers. As it takes hold of him and he collapses, and the Lone Gunmen successfully mind-control him into turning himself in. Byers explains to Susanne Modeski that, for all intents and purposes, she is deceased and that she has a new identity. She asks Byers to go with her to start a new life, but he explains he has to keep up the fight. She kisses him goodbye and hands over a wedding ring meant for Grant Ellis."

        "content": "\"Three of a Kind\" functions as a sequel of sorts to the fifth season episode \"Unusual Suspects\", concluding a minor story-arc featuring The Lone Gunmen and Susanne Modeski, the woman who led to the creation of the trio. At the time of filming for \"Three of a Kind\", David Duchovny, who portrays Fox Mulder, was unavailable for filming because he was preparing his directing debut, \"The Unnatural\". (Only David Duchovny's voice appears in the episode, during a scene in which The Lone Gunmen electronically synthesize it to convince Scully to travel to Las Vegas.) To compensate for this loss, co-executive producers Vince Gilligan and John Shiban decided to write an episode based around The Lone Gunmen. The writers wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines, mostly notably the disappearance of Susanne Modeski, who had last appeared in season five's \"The Unusual Suspects\". Gilligan explained, \"I'd been thinking a lot about what happened to Susanne Modeski\u2014what happened to her after she drove off with X in that mysterious car at the end of 'Unusual Suspects'\". Gilligan and Shiban soon formulated a plot that revolved around the Lone Gunmen in Las Vegas, \"Las Vegas just seemed a really good place to put these guys\", according to Gilligan. He explained: \"First of all, because the idea of them running through a casino is instantly hilarious. But the other thing [...] is that Las Vegas is in some ways the most watched city in the world\". The entire sub-plot featuring Susanne Modeski caused a minor continuity error that had to be retconned. Bruce Harwood, the actor who portrayed Byers, originally wore a wedding ring when he first portrayed the character, noting, \"I'd worn my wedding ring [during the first part of the series] so I imagined a married life for Byers\". During the filming of \"Unusual Suspects\"\u2014an episode that would largely feature Byers feeling a romantic connection to Susanne\u2014Harwood removed his wedding ring, deducing that in 1989, when the episode took place, Byers had not been married yet. However, \"Three of a Kind\"\u2014which takes place in 1999\u2014features Byers once again romantically drawn to Susanne. Harwood explained, \"And then [the producers] brought back the character Suzanne  Modeski back in season six, and that was supposed to be in the present. So I had to redo my back story; I said Byers had been divorced\"."

The two sisters long to break free from their tedious life and get experiences from the outside world, to prepare for their careers as writers. They have the intention of giving part of their income from the governess positions to their talented brother Branwell, so that he can go to London and study art, to become a great temperamental painter. One night when Bran is getting drunk at a local tavern, a man named Arthur Nicholls, his father's new curate, arrives. The drunken Bran insists that Arthur accompany him to the vicarage. At first Arthur refuses, believing that it is too late in the evening. When he realizes how drunk Bran has become, he accompanies him to see that he gets home safe and sound. Emily, who answers the door, mistakes Arthur for one of Bran's drunken friends and treats him with contempt. The next day Bran leaves for London again, and Arthur reappears at the house. He is greeted by the unwelcoming Mr. Bront\u00eb, and soon Emily realizes her mistake and she and Arthur become good friends. They go on walks together, and one day Emily shows Arthur a lonely house on a hill, the one that inspired her writing her novel, Wuthering Heights. Time passes and a disillusioned Bran returns home from London. He blames all his sisters for his failure as a painter. Soon after Charlotte and Anne also return home, and at a ball at the neighboring Thornton house, Arthur is struck by Charlotte's beauty and falls in love with her. When Charlotte realizes that Emily is interested in Arthur, she becomes interested in him as well. Later, a drunken Bran disrupts the dance, and Arthur leaves the dance and takes him home. Arthur discovers that Charlotte wants to take Emily with her to Brussels to further their educations. Since he is in love with Charlotte he decides to sponsor the trip. He secretly buys a painting from Bran, and with the money from the sale the sisters are able to go to Europe. Emily hopes that Arthur will ask her to stay behind, but he has fallen in love with Charlotte and will not comply. The girls start their education at the school of Monsieur and Madame Heger, located in Brussels. Before long Charlotte admits to Emily that she has received unwelcome attentions while she was a governess and that after she returned home, Arthur kissed her. Emily is heartbroken by the news. That night, Emily dreams about the moors and a threatening black horseman. Not so long after that, Monsieur Heger takes Charlotte privately to an exhibition and kisses her. When she returns to the Hegers' house, Emily is already packing, having received a letter from Anne saying that Bran is ill. Both Charlotte and Emily immediately rush back to England, and once they are back, they both start writing their novels. Bran reads them both and then he tells Emily that they are both in love with the same man. Eventually the sisters learn that Arthur bought the painting that financed their trip to Europe, and Emily insists that they should repay him. One day Emily can\u2019t find Bran so she goes out in the rain looking for him. She finds him, and shortly after that he collapses and dies. Emily\u2019s book Wuthering Heights and Charlotte's book Jane Eyre are both published under male pseudonyms. Despite the fact that Charlotte's sells better, the famous author William Makepeace Thackeray believes that Emily's is the greater of the two. Thackeray meets Charlotte and introduces her to London society. She convinces him to take her to the poverty-stricken East End, where Arthur now works. Arthur admits to Charlotte that he loves her, but because Emily loved him, he felt he could not stay in Yorkshire. Charlotte gets a message that Emily is taken seriously ill, and she hurries home to Yorkshire. She arrives just in time to say goodbye before her sister dies from her illness. After Emily\u2019s demise Arthur returns to woo Charlotte."

In order to get the money to leave, Ricky agrees to help local gangster Jack Ellerman rob the cigarette factory, and also gets Jim, a lorry driver hoping to buy an expensive transport licence, to join the plot. Ricky finds himself attracted to Catherine \"Cat\" Donovan (Rita Tushingham), who has been dating another member of Jack's gang, Charlie Batey. Although Cat agrees to date and even make love with Ricky, she is fiercely independent and refuses to take orders from him or stop seeing Charlie, pointing out that she and Ricky are not engaged so she is free to do as she likes. Ricky's father Matt, a dockworker, also wants to leave his insecure job and strike out on his own, and eventually quits and becomes a busker with a Houdini-like escape routine. Matt hates Jack Ellerman, who has been more financially successful than himself and was also his rival for Lil's affections many years ago. When Matt finds Jack and his gang at the Flints' house meeting with Ricky and Jim, Matt's anger on top of the stress of busking causes Matt to suffer a fatal stroke. On the night of the planned robbery, Jim decides at the last minute that he cannot go through with it and risk his family's future. Ricky takes Jim's lorry without his knowledge and fills in for Jim, as well as doing his own part of disabling the factory alarm. However, when Jack orders Ricky to stand guard with a lead pipe, Ricky finds himself unable to hit a police officer who approaches and disrupts the robbery, thus leaving it to Charlie to knock out the officer. Charlie later takes revenge on Ricky by setting fire to Jim's lorry. Ricky is badly burned attempting to put out the fire and recovers in hospital, during which time Cat visits him but also continues seeing Charlie. Meanwhile, slum clearance forces Lil to reluctantly move out of her home of 30 years into a new flat in another area.

Two local detectives, following up a simple burglary of an estate agent's office, discover the body and take on the investigation of the death. The dead woman cannot be identified but they initially think she is called Jean Sherman. A suitcase with the initials JS is left at the scene. The main suspect is an unidentified man who has used the false identity of John Campbell to rent the house in which the woman was found. The detectives methodically develop and follow up leads to identify both people, mostly in Brighton, but also further afield in Lewes and Greenwich. DI Fellows tracks down Jean Sherman and tricks her into giving him a name and address in order to get her handwriting, which proves her own name and address was written by her and found on the victim. Flashback scenes in her story specifically exclude the viewer from seeing the man John Campbell. Miss Sherman admits a one night stand with Campbell. One lead appears to identify the dead woman, but their follow-up reveals that the name is that of a woman who was at the house but is still living. They track down and arrest a suspect described by several persons as the man who occupied the house, but the case takes an unexpected turn when he admits that he was there but denies any involvement. After the dead woman is positively identified the veteran inspector leading the case develops a \"wild idea\" about the identity of another suspect, then orders a standard procedure that confirms his theory in a non-standard fashion. This suspect admits knowledge of the death but his contention that it was accidental appears to be unshakeable until the detectives realise that he has tripped himself up in a crucial detail."

The kidnappers, led by Fok Tak-nang, return to Grace's house, where they kill her maid, and start searching the place.  Grace is then taken to an abandoned house, where she manages to repair a destroyed telephone. With the phone, she manages to contact Bob, a single father and debt collector. Bob has promised his son, Kit-kit, and his sister, Jeannie, that he will meet them at an airport, before Kit-kit boards a flight to Australia. While talking to Grace on his cellular phone, Bob agrees to help Grace and hands his phone to patrol officer Fai, who believes that the distressing phone call is a prank, due to Bob's reckless driving. Grace is interrupted from the call when Fok and his men enter the room, having abducted her brother's friend, Joe. Fok forces Grace to contact her brother, Roy. After listening to Roy's answering machine, Fok kills Joe and leaves with his men, now planning to go after Grace's daughter, Tinker. Grace persuades Bob to head to the school and find her daughter before Fok's men do.  When Bob arrives, he is distracted by the school's headmaster, and minutes before the school's class dismissal, he finds Tinker too late, when she is abducted by Fok's men. Bob goes after the abductors, but winds up losing sight of them in the struggle. After crashing through a truck, Bob later finds a handgun left in his car by a fellow debt collector. Realizing that his phone has a low battery, Bob heads to a phone store to buy a cell phone charger. After losing his patience with the flirty service clerk, he holds the store at gunpoint and pays for the charger.  After Bob is caught on camera at both the school and the phone store, Fai heads to Grace Wong's residence.  He is still convinced that the kidnapping situation is a prank, having talked to Michelle, a woman impersonating Grace. Fok then decides to go after Grace's brother, Roy, who is in a hospital. Fai decides to call Grace's house, after realizing the real Grace Wong is a Mandarin-language speaker, while the impersonator he met speaks Cantonese. At the hospital, Bob manages to distract Grace's abductors, who are revealed by police to be Interpol agents. The agents, however, succeed in kidnapping Roy and take him to a hill where he has hidden a camcorder. Bob intervenes, grabbing a hold of the camera and fleeing from the agents; unfortunately, he loses connection with Grace. Fai heads to Grace's house, where he confronts and kills Michelle, realizing she was also an Interpol agent working for Fok. As Grace tries to contact Bob, she is caught by one Fok's henchmen. Grace kills the henchman and manages to find her daughter. However, while planning to escape, Grace and Tinker are caught by Fok. Bob looks at the evidence on the camcorder. The footage, captured by Roy, reveals Fok brutally executing several American drug dealers and stealing their contraband, exposing them all as dirty cops. Bob calls Fok, and tells them to meet him at the airport in an exchange for the evidence and the hostages, while attempting to keep his promise to his son. At the airport, Bob's plans to meet his sister and son are foiled as Fok conveniently stands between them and Bob's hiding place. After telling Fok to go towards the parking lot, he demands that Grace, Roy and Tinker be released. They flee to a patrol car that is also in the lot. Unfortunately, Bob is caught by Fok and his men, and fights against them until Fai catches up to them. Fok and his men are arrested by Detective Cheung and his Serious Crimes Unit. After Bob hands the videotaped evidence over to Detective Cheung, Fok and Tong, one of Fok's henchman, appear, and Cheung reveals that he was working with Fok. Fok deletes the footage on the videotape, and a violent confrontation ensues in a loading dock in the airport where Fai and Bob take on Fok, Cheung and the corrupt Interpol agents. Cheung is shot to death by Fai after attacking the patrol officer with a forklift truck. Bob confronts Fok on a scaffolding. After Bob reveals he still has videotaped evidence on his cell phone and threatens to send it to the police, Fok kicks Bob off the scaffolding. A net manages to save Bob's fall, but sends Fok falling to his death. While this was going on, a member of Fok's team rekidnaps Grace and her family and prepares to kill them, but Grace manages to defend her family long enough for the police to arrive. When Bob returns, Fai talks to him, feeling the glory he once had as a police officer, and wishing that they never meet again after their ordeal.  Bob then meets Grace for the first time in person. Grace thanks him, and Bob concludes their meeting by saying, \"If you're gonna call for help, no thanks! If you want dinner, then I'll consider.\" Bob is then reunited with his son, who is happy that his father kept his promise."

When Frank is found murdered the following day, the victim of a poisoning meant to look like an overdose, Goren deduces that his nemesis Nicole Wallace killed his brother. Soon afterward, Goren's mentor, Dr. Declan Gage, is also found to have been poisoned (but alive); subsequently, Bobby Goren and Eames are led on an interstate scavenger hunt, which leads them to Wallace's former stepdaughter, Gwen Chapel, in Arizona \u2014 who is now dying of cancer, which is believed to be the factor that triggered Wallace's recent actions \u2014 and ends at a hotel where they find a box with Goren's nephew Donny's name on it, containing a fresh human heart. Although Goren believes that Wallace murdered Donny to torment him, M.E. Rodgers confirms that it is in fact Wallace's heart in the box. Goren refuses to believe this, stating that Wallace has \"nine lives\". Gage suggests to Goren that Wallace had a partner who acted on her wishes, and that they were trying to frame Goren for her murder and Frank\u2019s. The captain orders a secret investigation of Goren (in case he is the actual perpetrator), which Eames only agrees to as a means to exonerate Goren.  Later evidence turns up that Frank Goren had a life insurance policy naming William Brady (Goren's undercover alias) as his beneficiary, supporting Gage's theory. At this time, Goren reveals that he has confirmed that serial killer Mark Ford Brady was his biological father. In a twist ending, it is revealed that Dr. Gage engineered this entire chain of events as an elaborate plan to \"free\" Goren from all of the negative people in Goren's troubled past\u2014people who had created the metaphorical demons that have increasingly tortured Goren throughout his life. Goren realizes this after he notices someone has tried to \"cut and part the pieces of (his) life together\" throughout the case. He learns that Gage wrote a book on female serial killers (such as his daughter Jo, who, as it turns out, was in a coma after biting off her tongue, just before her father wanted to meet with her, an event which triggered Declan\u00b4s actions) to attract Wallace's attention.  Knowing that she would try to seduce him, Gage spurned her advances to trick her into trusting him. Gage suggested to her that he also hates Bobby, to manipulate her into killing Frank. Knowing that Wallace's next move would be to kill him, Gage killed Wallace, cut out her heart, mailed some flowers in her name (aside from the ones she herself mailed to Goren), and faked his own poisoning to set the scavenger hunt in motion. Gage thought that Frank was \"going down anyway\", and that such people in Bobby's life \u2014 including Gage himself \u2014 were \"dead weight\" that would inevitably cause Bobby to completely self-destruct (since Goren felt too responsible for them to voluntarily shut them out of his life).  In Gage's twisted view, he did this to give \"the son he never had\" (but always wanted) a \"clean slate\": a fair chance at having a healthy, happy life, free of emotional baggage. Gage assures Goren that his nephew Donny is unharmed and still missing, as killing him would never have served his goal of \"helping\" Goren. Gage also tells Goren that Wallace's final words were \"Tell Bobby he's the only man I ever loved\"."

Bhaskaran hides the money before getting arrested, and the place is known only to his lawyer Vedimuthu (Vadivelu). Aishwarya pretends to be in love with Vedimuthu to find where the money is hidden. Meanwhile, to find a safe cover, Shiva and Kathir plan to imitate Saravanan, the grandson of a rich elderly couple: Rajasekar (Vijayakumar) and his wife Parvathi (Srividya). They have not seen their grandchild since his birth. Shiva and Kathir end up feigning to be Kadhir's body and Shiva's voice to make up for Saravanan in front of the blind couple. Ganesh (Delhi Ganesh), who knows Kathir before, makes several attempts to expose the truth to the couple, but all fail, due to Shiva and Kadhir's luck. All of a sudden, Anjali (Ankitha) arrives pretending to be Saravanan's lover. She calls on all the relatives of Rajasekar and Parvathi. The relatives arrive in Shiva's absence. Finding no way out, Kathir pretends to have fainted, and he is admitted to the hospital. Shiva comes to his rescue, and says that he is Dr. Karthikeyan, a friend of Saravanan from America. Amidst their drama, Kathir tries to steal the Lord Muruga statue, for which he plays a trick to injure Parvathi, which keeps all others out of the house for sometime. Shiva engages in a fight with Kathir when he tries to leave with the statue that he had stolen. Rajasekar accuses his relatives for his wife's accident and asks all of his relatives to leave at once. Shiva and Kathir get separated and part ways. A drunk Ganesh finally manages to reveal the truth to Rajasekar about Saravan's death in an accident following which Anjali reveals the truth to him that she is actually Saravanan's secretary and had come to explain about Saravanan's death in an accident in America. She also explains that Siva and Kathir were acting/posing as Saravanan & that she took part in the drama not wanting to ruin their happiness. After revealing all this, she gives them money and asks them to get out of the house. Shiva, realizing his mistake, refuses to take the money and asks Kathir not to take the money. Kathir leaves Shiva in anger, taking the money with him. Shiva returns to Rajasekar and confesses all of his mistakes. Rajasekar asks them to continue the drama for the sake of his wife, who loves her grandson more than her life. Parvathy comes and calls Saravanan but gets no replies. She finally gets hold of the arms of Kathir, who has returned in remorse. Hence, the movie happily ends with the marriage of Shiva and Anjali, who by now have fallen in love with each other."

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 30, 2008. In the episode, Homer becomes suspicious of Bart's new Muslim friend, Bashir, and decides to invite his family for dinner. When Homer offends them, he goes to their home to apologize but discovers what he believes to be a terrorist plot to blow up the Springfield Mall. In the episode's subplot, Lisa gets a MyPod (a parody of iPod) and racks up a large bill. The episode was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Steven Dean Moore with Shohreh Aghdashloo of 24 guest-starring as Bashir's mother, Mina. It is the first episode of The Simpsons to have Islam portrayed in a large role. It was the most watched show on Fox on its original airing, and received fairly positive reviews from television critics. Its commentary on Islamophobia in the United States proved to be controversial, however. The episode's theme was praised by the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations and the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and Aghdashloo was given an award by the latter organization for her role."

Fleeing from the Mapple customers, he runs into a Muslim boy from Jordan named Bashir and befriends him. Homer is impressed by Bashir's manners, but Lenny, Carl and Moe convince him that all Muslims are terrorists. He invites Bashir's family over to dinner in an attempt to expose them, but openly offends them, causing them to leave. Later that evening, while going to their home to apologize, Homer catches a glimpse of Bashir's father working with TNT in his garage. He goes home and has a nightmare featuring the Genie of Aladdin, who transforms the \"decadent, Western society\" into a stereotypical Islamic republic. Shaken by the dream, Homer eavesdrops on Bashir's father speaking about his work in building demolition, but misinterprets it and believes he is a suicide bomber. As soon as Bashir's father departs for work, Homer convinces the mother to invite him so he can apologize. He hacks into the family's laptop and discovers a diagram of demolition plans for the Springfield Mall. Homer rushes to the mall to warn the shoppers and sees Bart standing near a detonator with Bashir and his father; he attempts to save the day by throwing the dynamite in the river. It actually turns out that the old mall was slated for destruction. Realizing his mistake, Homer apologizes, and the Simpson family throws a \"Pardon My Intolerance\" party for Bashir's family. In a subplot, Lisa obtains a MyPod from Krusty the Clown at the Mapple Store. She becomes obsessed with the device and racks up a US$1,200 bill. She goes to Mapple's undersea headquarters and begs Steve Mobbs to consider a reduced payment plan. Mobbs offers Lisa a job at Mapple to help with her bill. Much to her chagrin, the job is standing on a street corner dressed as a MyPod, handing out Mapple pamphlets and telling people to \"Think Differently\"."

Guy Bennett (Rupert Everett) and Tommy Judd (Colin Firth) are pupils and, because they are both outsiders in their own ways, friends (Bennett is gay while Judd is a Marxist). One day, a teacher walks in on Martineau (Philip Dupuy) and a boy from another house engaged in mutual masturbation. Martineau subsequently hangs himself, as teachers and the senior pupils try their hardest to keep the scandal away from parents and the outside world. The gay scandal, however, gives the army-obsessed house Captain Fowler (Tristan Oliver) a welcome reason to scheme against Bennett. Fowler dislikes him and Judd and wants to stop Bennett from becoming a \"God\" \u2013 a school title for the two top prefects. Fowler is able to intercept a love note from Bennett to James Harcourt (Cary Elwes). Bennett agrees to be punished with a caning so as not to compromise Harcourt; whereas on earlier occasions, he had avoided punishment by blackmailing the other \"Lords\" with the threat that he would reveal their own experiences with him. Meanwhile, Judd is reluctant to become a prefect, since he feels that he cannot endorse a \"system of oppression\" such as this. He makes a memorable, bitter speech about how the boys oppressed by the system grow up to be the fathers who maintain it. Eventually, however, he agrees to become a prefect in order to prevent the hateful Fowler from becoming Head of House. This never comes about because Donald Devenish (Rupert Wainwright) agrees to stay at school and become a prefect if he is nominated to become a God instead of Bennett. Devastated at the loss of his cherished dream of becoming a God, Bennett comes to realise that the British class system strongly relies on outward appearance and that to be openly gay is a severe hindrance to his intended career as a diplomat. The film's epilogue reports that he defected to Russia later in his life, after having been a spy for the Soviet Union. Judd died fighting in the Spanish Civil War."

The film centers on Foster as he treks on foot across the city of Los Angeles, trying to reach the house of his estranged ex-wife in time for his daughter's birthday. Along the way, a series of encounters, both trivial and provocative, causes him to react with increasing violence and make sardonic observations on life, poverty, the economy, and commercialism.

        "content": "William Foster is stuck in traffic on the hottest day recorded in the city's history. After his air conditioning fails, he abandons his car and begins walking home across Los Angeles, carrying his briefcase. At a convenience store, the Korean owner refuses to give change for a telephone call without a purchase. Foster begins ranting about the high prices; the owner grabs a baseball bat and demands Foster leave. Foster takes the bat and destroys much of the merchandise before leaving. Shortly thereafter, while resting on a hill, he is accosted by two Latino gang members, who threaten him with a knife and demand his briefcase. Foster fends them off with the bat and takes their knife. The two gang members, now in a car with two friends, cruise the streets and find Foster at a public payphone. They open fire, hitting several bystanders but not Foster. The driver loses control and crashes. Foster picks up a gun, shoots the one surviving gang member in the leg, and then leaves with their bag of weapons. Foster encounters a panhandler and gives him the briefcase (which only contains his lunch). At a fast-food restaurant, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but finds they have just switched to the lunch menu less than a minute ago. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a gun and accidentally fires it into the ceiling. After trying to reassure the frightened employees and customers, he orders lunch, but is annoyed when the burger looks nothing like the one shown on the menu. He leaves, tries to call from a phone booth, then shoots the booth to pieces after being hassled by someone who was waiting to use the phone. After Foster calls \"home\" again and states his intention to attend his daughter Adele's birthday party, his ex-wife Beth notifies the police because she has a restraining order, as she feared he might become violent. Sergeant Prendergast, on his last day before early retirement, and routinely a subject of scorn and ridicule by his colleagues, insists on investigating the crimes. Interviews with the witnesses at each scene lead Prendergast to realize that the same person may be responsible. Foster's \"D-FENS\" vanity license plate proves to be an important lead because Prendergast remembers being in the same traffic jam as Foster earlier that day. Prendergast and his partner, Detective Torres, visit Foster's mother, who is surprised to learn that Foster lost his job. They realize Foster is heading toward his former family's home in Venice, California, and rush to intercept him. Foster passes a bank where a black man is protesting after being rejected for a loan application. The man exchanges a glance with Foster and says, \"don't forget me\" as he is escorted away by police. Foster stops at a military surplus store to buy a new pair of shoes. The owner, a white supremacist, diverts Torres's attention when she comes in to ask questions. After she leaves, he offers Foster a rocket launcher, congratulates him for shooting \"a bunch of niggers\" at the Whammy Burger, and claims affinity with him. Foster refutes him in disgust and tries to leave, but the man draws a gun, attempting to handcuff Foster and turn him over to the police; Foster stabs him with the gang member's knife and shoots him dead. He changes into army fatigues and boots and leaves with the rocket launcher. Foster encounters a road repair crew, who are not working and just lazing about while the furious commuters protest, and accuses them of doing unnecessary repairs to justify their budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher, but struggles to use it, until a boy standing by explains how it works, having learned from TV. Foster accidentally fires the launcher, blowing up the construction site. He crosses through a private golf course, frightening an elderly golfer into a heart attack. He also briefly holds a family hostage at a plastic surgeon's house while dodging the police, where he shows signs of a mental breakdown. By the time he reaches Beth's house, she has already fled with Adele. He realizes that they may have gone to nearby Venice Pier, but Prendergast and Torres arrive before he can go after them. Foster shoots Torres, injuring her, and flees with Prendergast in pursuit. At the pier, Foster encounters his ex-wife and daughter. Adele is happy to see him, but Beth is frightened. Prendergast arrives and acknowledges Foster's complaints about being ill-treated by society (revealing his own grief over his child dying from SIDS), but does not accept that as an excuse for his criminal rampage. With Foster distracted, Beth kicks the gun away as Prendergast draws his revolver, insisting that Foster give himself up. Foster then proposes a showdown with Prendergast (claiming Adele would get his insurance money if he dies) and draws another gun; Prendergast shoots him, only to find Foster was armed with a water pistol. Foster falls dead from the pier into the water. Prendergast, finally asserting himself, opts to hold off on his retirement afterward. The movie ends with tape recordings of Foster, Beth, and Adele playing on the TV inside their house."

        "content": "On the eve of their visit to France, the members of the Hand & Flower pub darts team gather for a drink. The day trip has been organised by one of the team, Percy, who is a travel agent. For some of the team, it is their first ever trip abroad, while for others it is the first time they have returned to France since their service in World War I or World War II. Charley is looking forward to meeting some French mademoiselles, but Fred, the pub's married landlord, says there'll be none of that sort of thing. Stan has a plan to buy watches in France and smuggle them back into Britain, avoiding customs duty. Jim is going through a rocky patch with his fianc\u00e9e, whom he suspects considers him to be boring and staid. The following day, the group meet at London Victoria station and catch the boat train to Folkestone Harbour station for the ferry across the English Channel to Boulogne-sur-Mer. Once they have landed in France, despite the insistence of Fred that they stick together, Jim departs to visit the area where he had been involved in heavy fighting during 1944 when British troops had arrived to liberate France. In the local florists, the shop owners refuse to take his money for flowers for his friend's grave. After taking them to the cemetery where his comrade is buried, he visits a local farm and meets Martine, with whom he spent time eight years before when she was eleven. Now an attractive young woman, she recognises him and invites him to have lunch with her family who also remember him. They immediately strike up a chemistry, which his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e in England lacks. However, Martine is engaged to a local lawyer who is expecting to land a prestigious partnership in Paris. Back in town, the rest of the group enjoy lunch in a cafe and then separate to tour around the town. Stan goes and picks up his black market watches, while \"Shorty\", stewing over those who use his resented nickname, gets drunk and joins the French Foreign Legion, in spite of Charley's efforts to stop him. Fred is enticed by a young woman into a bar and she persuades him to buy champagne for them and dance with her. He is embarrassed when Charley finds him in there. Percy, the travel agent, becomes violently homesick and desperate for a cup of tea. Reassembling, the group attempt but fail to retrieve Shorty from service in the Foreign Legion, and then drift towards the docks and the ship for the return trip, wondering what has happened to Jim who has been missing all day. Stan sees a policeman calling to him, so, thinking he knows about the watches, throws them into the water; but he only wants to return Stan's passport which he had left at the customs check. Jim has fallen in love with Martine, but they argue over whether they can be together, and he heads for the docks, while Martine goes to rejoin her fianc\u00e9e. But once there, she tells him she does not love him and cannot marry him, and then drives hurriedly towards the docks. Meanwhile, on a blind date with a friend, Jim's fianc\u00e9e in London has met and struck up a relationship with an American serviceman. Arriving as his ship is leaving, Martine shouts her true feelings for Jim, and they agree to meet again when he returns to France, soon."

        "content": "In the final moments of the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, a weakened French battalion awaits a last assault by communist Vi\u1ec7t Minh troops. The battalion commander, Basque Lt. Col. Pierre-No\u00ebl Rasp\u00e9guy (Anthony Quinn), has called central headquarters for reinforcements. Headquarters sends only a single plane load of French paratroopers, under the command of Major de Clairefons. Despite Rasp\u00e9guy's attempts to provide covering fire, the paratroopers are slaughtered as they land. Major de Clairefons is killed when his parachute drags him into a minefield. Rasp\u00e9guy is enraged that General Melies (Jean Servais) sent only one plane, and further believes that Melies intends to make him responsible for the entire debacle at Dien Bien Phu. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh overrun the French, with the survivors captured and imprisoned. Among Rasp\u00e9guy's friends are military historian Captain Phillipe Esclavier (Alain Delon), Indochina-born Captain Boisfeures (Maurice Ronet), surgeon Captain Dia (Gordon Heath) and Lt. Ben Mahidi (George Segal), an Algerian-born paratrooper who turns down a Vi\u1ec7t Minh leader's (Burt Kwouk) offer for preferential treatment because he is an Arab. Rasp\u00e9guy's leadership keeps the men together in their captivity. When released after a treaty between the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and France, Rasp\u00e9guy leads his men in demolishing a delousing station that they see as a humiliation. Upon his return home to Algeria, Ben Mahidi is disgusted at the treatment of his people, especially when his teenaged brother is machine gunned by the police for painting graffiti in support of independence from France. He deserts from the army to join the rebels of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN), becoming a guerrilla leader. Upon his own return from Indochina, Lt. Col. Rasp\u00e9guy starts a relationship with Countess Nathalie de Clairefons (Mich\u00e8le Morgan), widow of the Major who died while trying to reinforce Rasp\u00e9guy's battalion. The Countess' military contacts result in Rasp\u00e9guy being given command of the new 10th Regiment of Parachutistes Coloniaux, serving under General Melies in the Algerian war. The General briefs him that the command is his last chance in the military: if his Regiment fails, Rasp\u00e9guy's career is finished. Rasp\u00e9guy recruits his comrades-in-arms from Indochina and trains his battalion with harsh methods, such as using live ammunition on an assault course to encourage speed and initiative. Soon after beginning counter-insurgency operations in both urban and rural environments, Esclavier falls in love with Mahidi's sister Aicha (Claudia Cardinale), who is loyal to the FLN and uses her friendship with Esclavier to smuggle explosive detonators. The previously naive Esclavier begins to have a new view of his nation's conduct as the FLN rebels and French parachutists try to outdo each other in breaking the rules of war. Rasp\u00e9guy eventually turns on his old comrades who have become too sympathetic to the FLN. Referred to as General (but still wearing Lt. Col. ranks), Rasp\u00e9guy's last scene shows him receiving a medal while his Regiment is presented with a unit citation. Outside the compound where this is happening Esclavier, who has left the army in disgust, laughs when he sees a child painting a pro-independence slogan on the wall."

Benny's performances on a popular Saturday night radio program result in Fletcher Henderson volunteering to do some arrangements for him. On the west coast, the radio show's early start has made Benny's music a sensation with a younger generation. He puts together a quartet featuring Gene Krupa on drums, Teddy Wilson on piano and Lionel Hampton on vibraphone.

Goodman was by then so accomplished that he could no longer reproduce the sound of an amateur clarinetist. The film's star, Steve Allen, was himself a pianist but had never played clarinet, and the squeaky attempts of a beginner were the only sounds Allen could make on a clarinet. Thus the clarinet heard during the film's first scenes was played by Steve Allen. Many of Goodman's contemporaries made appearances in this film. However, while Ziggy Elman appeared on screen recreating his trumpet solo on \"And the Angels Sing\", he was unable to record his portion for the soundtrack; Mannie Klein actually performed it, off-camera. Similarly, Red Mack's performance in the film is actually played by Alvin Alcorn. Fletcher Henderson is portrayed by Sammy Davis, Sr., father of Sammy Davis, Jr. Talent scout John Hammond was dissatisfied with the way he and the rest of the Hammond family, including his sister Alice, were portrayed in the movie. He objected and the next version of the script saw his character completely removed, with all of his actions given over to another character, Willard Alexander, Goodman's manager. Hammond objected even more strenuously, pointing out that, among many other things, Willard Alexander did not host the party in the Hammond mansion where Goodman first played Mozart publicly, nor did he introduce Alice to Benny. In the end, Hammond reluctantly agreed to leave his portrayal in the film, though he sued for $50,000 for being portrayed in what he thought was an unflattering manner."

After Bobby flips the coin, they both run off Brooklyn Bridge in opposite directions. From that moment on two separate storylines are followed. One storyline takes place in Brooklyn, where Bobby and Kate decide to go visit Kate's family. On the way they pick up a stray dog, whose owner they try to locate. Kate's family has its share of family drama, with an uncle who is institutionalized and suffers from memory loss, a brother who died five years earlier, and a sister who is taking a year off before going to college, much to her mother's dismay. The other storyline takes place in Manhattan (beginning in Chinatown), where Bobby and Kate find a cellphone belonging to a criminal who values it at $500,000. They try to set up an exchange, but after narrowly escaping pursuit from a killer, Bobby throws the cellphone onto a passing boat. Both storylines end the next day on a bridge, with the lines \"What do you want to do now? / What do we do now? I don't know. I guess we just keep going\". The storylines are also set apart by colors of vehicles and Bobby and Kate's clothing. In the Manhattan/Chinatown storyline, they both wear easily recognizable yellow, a dress for her and a T-shirt for him, they took a yellow cab, while in the Brooklyn storyline, they are dressed in more subtle shades of green and Kate is driving her green car.

The film skips forward to a point after the war when Captain Holland's brother, Charles Holland , is guided into the desert by Ali (Donald Pleasence) in search of his brother. They were drawn by a promissory note that had been given by Captain Holland to the Bedouin for their help and eventually taken to the British embassy for payment. Sir Charles sets off to discover the fate of his brother and eventually reaches the Bedouin camp. He is entertained by the camp's chief, Sheik Salem ben Yussef (Andr\u00e9 Morrel) and sees a young blonde boy in the camp. Later, the Sheik becomes angry at Sir Charles's line of questioning about his brother, the boy, and note and asks them to leave. Before they leave, Mabrouka gives Ali a sock containing Captain Holland's diary which he gives Sir Charles. The film skips back in time to recount the story within the diary. Captain Holland, having been tended by Mabrouka, recovers. He learns that Mabrouka is the sheik's daughter and is betrothed to Sheik Faris (Michael Craig) from another tribe. When a German reconnaissance vehicle arrives at the camp, Captain Holland hides in some Roman ruins. The senior German officer then finds Holland's service revolver in a tent. Mabrouka and Captain Holland become romantically involved to the obvious annoyance of Sheik Faris. He colludes with the Germans who return to the ruins where Holland and Sheik Yussef kill them and Faris. The romance between Captain Holland and Mabrouka deepens and they marry. Learning of the British victory at El Alamein, Captain Holland seeks to return to the British lines but finds that his wife is pregnant. A group led by the Sheik and Captain Holland travel toward the British lines but come across a column of retreating Italian vehicles. Captain Holland sustains a fatal injury rescuing the Sheik. The film returns to the present day with the Sheik handing Sir Charles a letter with his brother's will bequeathing his estate to his son. Sir Charles discusses this with his nephew but the boy decides to remain with the tribe and burns the letter."

WowWee entered a partnership with Arad Productions, run by producer Avi Arad, who was interested in Robosapien since the toy debuted. Time reported the planned film as part of a growing trend to make films based on toys, citing the 2007 releases Transformers and Bratz: The Movie. Arad took an active role in developing the lead character for the film. He worked very closely with Art Director Shane Nakamura and the design team at WowWee. In August 2008, feature film rights were officially sold by WowWee to producer duo Arad and Steven Paul, the latter producing films under Crystal Sky Pictures. The film was revealed to be titled Robosapien: Rebooted, and in the negotiation, WowWee reserved the worldwide right to market toys related to the film and to receive a portion of returns for other merchandise related to the film. Sean McNamara was hired to direct the film. Filming took place in New Orleans in 2008 from March 24-April 25. The city was chosen because Arad became familiar with it when he attended National Association of Television Program Executives conventions there in the 1980s and 1990s.  He also chose the city to take advantage of tax breaks and its scenery; the story was also rewritten so it would recognizably take place in New Orleans. In September 2010, Arc Productions (formerly Starz Animation) joined the project with Crystal Sky and Arad Productions."

Immediately trying to find a replacement, she spots an elderly man (Richard Attenborough) who was berating the inebriated Santa before the parade. When Dorey begs him to take over, he introduces himself as Kris Kringle. Kris does so well during the parade that he is immediately hired to be Cole's main Santa for the holiday period. All the children in New York begin to believe that he is the real Santa, with the exception of Dorey's six-year-old daughter Susan (Mara Wilson). Dorey's boyfriend, attorney Bryan Bedford (Dylan McDermott), does his best to convince Susan to believe. While being babysat one night by Kris, Susan shares with him her Christmas wish, she would like a dad, a house (used every year for the Cole's catalogue photoshoot) and a baby brother. Kris asks if she would begin to believe in Santa if she got all those things. Susan agrees that she would. Kris is credited with bringing in increasingly more sales to Cole's than previous years. One night, he is arrested for assaulting a man on the street, later revealed to be the original drunk Santa, Tony Falacchi. Falacchi had taken revenge by means of setting up Kris to be arrested, with the help of members of staff from a rival department store of Cole's, Shopper's Express. With the help of Bryan, Dorey takes Kris's case to court, and drums up support for him from the public. It soon becomes clear that to get Kris acquitted and freed, Bryan must somehow prove that not only does Santa exist, but that Kris is the real one. It is a seemingly impossible task until Bryan comes up with a plan that requires some help from Susan. Just as the judge (Robert Prosky) is about to make his decision \u2013 and it seems he was going to rule against Kris \u2013 Susan walks up to the judge with a Christmas card containing a $1 bill. On the back, the words In God We Trust are circled. The judge realizes that, since the US Department of Treasury can put its official faith in God on US currency with no hard evidence, then the people of New York can believe in Santa Claus in the same way. Left with no choice, the elated judge dismisses the case and declares that Santa is real, existing in the person of Kris Kringle. Following the court case, Dorey and Bryan are maneuvered by Kris into realizing their true feelings for each other, and are married in a very small ceremony right after the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. On Christmas morning, Susan wakes to the news of the marriage (via the bright reflections of Dorey's engagement ring on the Christmas tree) and is elated to see that she has part one of her Christmas wish, Bryan as her new step-dad. Together, Susan, Dorey and Bryan drive out to the catalogue house and upon arrival, find that Kris has arranged for them to purchase the house, which they can now afford due to the size of the Christmas bonus Dorey has received as a result of Kris's work at Cole's. Susan, now having got two out of three of her wishes, excitedly runs upstairs in the house to look at her bedroom. Dorey and Bryan are about to kiss when Dorey ask her what the last part of her Christmas wish was, and she triumphantly announces that it was a baby brother. Dorey and Bryan both look at each other, shocked, before glancing down at Dorey's tummy and sharing a kiss. The film ends with the belief that Susan has now received all she asked for in her wish. It is mentioned that Kris has gone overseas."

For Halloween II, Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Strode and Myers, and the idea that they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. He wanted to portray how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film. Halloween II was officially released on August 28, 2009 in North America, and was met with a negative reception from critics. On October 30, 2009 it was re-released in North America to coincide with the Halloween holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million. The film would go on to earn $33.4 million in North America, and $6 million in foreign countries giving the film a worldwide total of $39.4 million. Rob Zombie declined to return to film another sequel. A sequel, Halloween 3D, was cancelled in 2012. Halloween II is the final Halloween film to be distributed by Dimension Films. It was followed by Halloween in 2018, a direct sequel to the original 1978 film produced by Blumhouse Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures."

        "content": "During his time in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, a young Michael Myers is visited by his mother Deborah who gives him a white horse statuette as a gift. Fifteen years later, Laurie Strode is wandering around in shock after having shot an adult Michael. Sheriff Lee Brackett finds Laurie and takes her to the hospital. Meanwhile, the paramedics pick up Annie Brackett and Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis, who survived being attacked by Michael, and also take them to the hospital. Michael's body is taken in another ambulance. When the driver has a traffic accident, Michael awakens and escapes, killing a paramedic injured in the accident. One year later, Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael has been missing and is presumed dead. While Laurie deals with her trauma, Dr. Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Elsewhere, Michael, who is still alive and living as a drifter, has been having visions of his mother's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instruct him to reunite with Laurie. Michael arrives at a farm and kills the owners before he sets off for Haddonfield. As Michael travels to Haddonfield, Laurie begins having hallucinations that mirrored Michael's past. Her hallucinations also begin to include her acting out Michael's murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour to promote his new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a Halloween party with her co-workers, Mya and Harley, to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears at the party and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie. When Laurie and Mya return to the house, they find Annie, who dies in Laurie's arms. Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Sheriff Brackett arrives home and finds his daughter dead. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed. Laurie awakens to her hallucinations with Deborah, seen by both her and Michael, who asks for her to call her \"mommy\". The police discover Michael's location and surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside to try to reason with Michael but when he tries to resuscitate Laurie from her hallucinations, Michael grabs Loomis and stabs him to death before being shot through the cabin window by Brackett and impaled on a rake. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over to Michael and stabs him to death with his own knife. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out wearing Michael's mask. Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning as Deborah's ghost approaches with the horse."

        "content": "In 2008, at the 30 Years of Terror Convention, Halloween producer Malek Akkad confirmed that a sequel to Rob Zombie's 2007 film was in the works. Despite French filmmakers Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo being in negotiations to direct the sequel in November 2008, Rob Zombie took on the duty and was also writer. In an interview, Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first Halloween made him not want to come back for a sequel, but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea. The writer/director explained that with the sequel he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any \"John Carpenter-ness\", as he \"felt free to do whatever\". Producer Malek Akkad said the original intention, when they believed Zombie was not returning, was to create a \"normal sequel\". Akkad and his Trancus producing company hired various writers to come up with drafts for a new film, but none worked. Akkad and the Weinstein brothers then turned to Bustillo and Muary, whose film Inside had recently been bought for distribution by the Weinstein Company. According to Akkad, the producers really wanted Zombie to return, as Akkad felt that there was something \"lost in the translation\" when the French filmmakers took over the project. After his work on the 2007 remake, Zombie had earned the trust of Akkad, who told him to ignore any rules they had set for him on the previous film. Akkad said that he wanted Zombie to move the franchise away from some of its established rules."

Unable to afford the cost of replacing the equipment, Brakhage instead opted to buy cheaper 8mm film equipment, which at the time was being marketed to amateurs to use for home movies. The Songs were Brakhage's first works in the medium. Altogether, there are 31 parts to the cycle, all but one of which is numbered in some way. Brakhage would occasionally combine two parts to make one film, making for a total of 25 films, including both parts of Song 27, which were released separately. Though most of the Songs are only a few minutes, some are as long as half an hour and the 23rd part, titled 23rd Psalm Branch, runs 69 minutes. Projected as a series, the cycle runs about 289 minutes. Starting in 1979, Brakhage released reprinted and revised versions of some of the Songs films, including a 16mm version of 23rd Psalm Branch in two parts. This version runs a total of 78 minutes. In 1987, Brakhage released a 20-minute version of My Mtn. Song 27, the first half of the cycle's 27th part."

In the course of his investigation of an underground resistance movement, he uncovers a conspiracy that leads to the heart of the new world order. Stone throws in his lot with this group of rebel Christians, which includes journalist Helen Hannah played by actress Leigh Lewis, a computer engineer working for One Nation Earth (Tony Nappo), and a beautiful blind cynic (Carol Alt).

        "content": "Thorold Stone a counterterrorist agent, is watching home video tapes of his wife and daughter, both of whom have vanished in the Rapture. The next morning, Stone and his partner, David Nidd, track down and arrest a mysterious terrorist group known as The Haters. Stone orders that the group be taken to the nearest headquarters of O.N.E. - One Nation Earth, the world government opposed by The Haters. While being carted away, a woman named Selma Davis confronts Stone and slips him a disc she claims will reveal the truth about his wife's disappearance. As they leave the hideout, Stone and Nidd notice a disturbance in a nearby building. When they check it out, they are confronted by Len Parker, the manager of WNN (World News Network). Parker punishes the agents for disobeying orders by shooting them both, and leaves them for dead - displaying supernatural powers when he walks through the wall; yet, Stone mysteriously wakes up to find he is still alive. In another cell of the Christian Underground, Helen Hannah informs her group that their initial plan with the disc has failed, and O.N.E's exact goals remain obscure. A member named Cindy worries that the public will fail to rise up against O.N.E, since crowds cheered the execution of Hannah's boyfriend, Bronson Pearl, on national television. The group is also mystified by a pair of Virtual Reality headsets they have received by mail. Meanwhile, at the O.N.E. Headquarters, various alleged Haters are being thrown into cells, half of which were denounced by their own families and sent for reeducation. Parker's agents inform him that Stone is alive and in possession of the disc. Furious, Parker orders a complete manhunt for Stone. He then vents his feelings by torturing Selma Davis. Stone, on the run, turns to his friend Willie Spino (a computer expert) for help. He is able to persuade Spino that O.N.E. is not the benign organization it is widely believed to be, and that the so-called Haters know valuable information. Spino manages to hack into O.N.E.'s security system, but this alerts O.N.E. to their location. Desperate, Spino suggests they flee to his stepsister's house; said stepsister in question is revealed to be Helen Hannah, and her house is also her cell's hideout. Spino discovers that the disc contains a powerful computer virus. The group quickly realize its use - O.N.E. has been sending VR headsets to everybody on Earth, to be activated on the upcoming 'Day of Wonders. On this day, the user will come face to face with the virtual Macalousso and will be forced to make one of two choices: Accept the mark of the beast or \"allegiance\" and accept Macalousso as God and he\u2019ll fulfill your \u201cheart\u2019s desires\u201d or reject him and his mark and suffer the death penalty, where the victim will most likely face the guillotine.   This fulfills the prophecy in the Bible of Revelation 20:4 \"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\" However, Stone is skeptical about the Christian Underground - he confronts Hannah about God's cruelty in taking millions hostage; however, the former acknowledges O.N.E. as the greater evil and agrees to help upload the virus. Spino is able to sneak Stone into Headquarters by passing him off as a guard. At midnight, the Day of Wonders begins. Cindy, tempted by curiosity, tries on the headset - and encounters Franco Macalousso, the Leader of O.N.E in person who presents himself as the Messiah, freeing Cindy from her blindness. Fooled, Cindy accepts the Mark of the Beast. She then persuades Spino, with whom she has begun a relationship, to take the Mark. Possessed, Spino and Cindy attempt to kill Hannah, who manages to flee. Hannah then infiltrates the Headquarters with the help of a secret ally - Ron Spalding, a converted guard. Stone tries on the headset, so that the virus may enter O.N.E's virtual reality. Encountering Macalousso, Stone is almost fooled when he sees illusions of his wife and daughter. He suddenly has an epiphany and realises that Macalousso is the Antichrist. Furious at being rejected, Macalousso prepares to decapitate Stone on a guillotine - but Hannah and Spalding disable the computer running the headset just in time. Parker, Spino, and Cindy arrive with a group of agents. Parker takes Helen, Spalding and Stone into a room where they join Davis, her daughter, and a young boy. Parker gives the Christians one last chance to renounce God, but meets refusal. As Parker leaves the room, Stone tells Selma that he's sorry and she forgives him. They all start to sing \"Amazing Grace\". Outside, the agents pull down a switch, revealing the room to be a giant furnace; yet, Parker is startled when they don't burn - God is protecting them. Parker decides to go into the furnace and kill them himself but when he opens the door, the fire immolates him and invades the entire building. The O.N.E. Headquarters burn down due to the rampaging furnace, killing many people, including Cindy - but leaving the Christians unharmed. The O.N.E. is temporarily weakened by the sabotage of Virtual Reality and the destruction of their Headquarters. An angered Macalousso swears to continue the fight: \"They will not prevail against us!\" The film ends with Stone looking at a picture of his family. He knows they are safe."

Takeru's older brother Minoru (Teruyuki Kagawa) quickly intervenes and soothes their father with drinks and sympathetic comments. Takeru and Minoru later have a conversation, which reveals Takeru's thinly veiled contempt towards Minoru for not having the strength to leave their dead-end hometown, but Minoru tells him he doesn't understand how things are and besides, he's fine with the way things are. Takeru later learns that his brother has taken over their family business, a run-down garage, and that his ex-girlfriend, Chieko (Y\u014dko Maki), now works there as a gas attendant. Chieko and Takeru later meet for drinks, and proceed to have a one-night stand. In the morning after, she hesitantly suggests she would be happy to follow him to Tokyo when he leaves, but he pretends he doesn't hear her. Minoru realises something has happened between his younger brother and Chieko, and suggests they all should go for a walk along the Hasami River in the mountains where Takeru could take photographs. Chieko, believing this would buy more time with Takeru, immediately agrees. Wanting to get away from their town's mundaneness, Takeru agrees. During the trip, Takeru distances himself from Chieko by walking ahead of her and Minoru. Whilst on a forested mountain, he takes photographs and through his viewfinder, sees Minoru and Chieko talking on a suspension bridge over a gorge. He looks away to take photographs of flowers. On the bridge, Minoru tries to catch Chieko when she stumbles, but she recoils from his touch as she shouts at him to get away from her. They stare at each other for a few tense seconds. Minoru asks if she's leaving him for Takeru. Chieko replies that she has no interest in him, and never will. Takeru glances back to the bridge and sees Minoru alone on the bridge, looking down to the gorge below, and realises Chieko has fallen from the bridge. The police locates Chieko's body in the gorge and arrests Minoru for murder. His father rejects the charge, insisting Minoru isn't the type to kill, but Takeru isn't so sure. As the case proceeds during a courtroom trial, Takeru begins to doubt his testimony when he realises hidden resentment and deeply buried anger between Minoru and himself, which may have affected what he witnessed on the bridge that afternoon."

        "content": "(, \"S\u00fcss the Jew\") is a 1940 Nazi German historical drama and propaganda film produced by Terra Film at the behest of Joseph Goebbels. It is considered one of the most antisemitic films of all time. The film was directed by Veit Harlan, who wrote the screenplay with Eberhard Wolfgang M\u00f6ller and Ludwig Metzger. The leading roles were played by Ferdinand Marian and Harlan's wife Kristina S\u00f6derbaum; Werner Krauss and Heinrich George played key supporting roles. The film has been characterized as \"one of the most notorious and successful pieces of antisemitic film propaganda produced in Nazi Germany.\" It was a great success in Germany, and was seen by 20 million people. Although its budget of 2 million Reichsmarks was considered high for films of that era, the box office receipts of 6.5 million Reichsmarks made it a financial success. Heinrich Himmler urged members of the SS and police to see it. After the war, some of the leading cast members were brought to trial as part of the denazification process. They generally defended their participation in the film on the grounds that they had only done so under duress. Despite significant evidence to support their arguments, Susan Tegel, author of Nazis and the Cinema, characterizes their postwar attempts to distance themselves from the film as \"crass and self-serving\"; she argues that their motives for accepting the roles seem to have been more driven by opportunistic ambition than by antisemitism. Harlan was the only major movie director of the Third Reich to stand trial for crimes against humanity. After three trials, he was given a light sentence because he convinced the courts that the antisemitic content of the film had been dictated by Goebbels and that Harlan had worked to moderate the antisemitism. Eventually, Harlan was reinstated as a citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany and made nine more films. He remained a controversial figure and the target of protests. Together with Die Rothschilds and Der ewige Jude, both released in 1940, the film remains one of the most frequently discussed examples of the use of film to further the Nazi antisemitic agenda. In the 2000s, two documentary films and a drama were released that explore the history and impact of the film."

As a financial advisor for Duke Karl Alexander, he also gained a prominent position at the court and held the reins of the finances in his duchy. He established a duchy monopoly on the trade of salt, leather, tobacco, and liquor and founded a bank and porcelain factory. In the process, he made multiple enemies who claimed, among other things, that he was involved with local gambling houses. When Karl Alexander died suddenly, Oppenheimer was arrested and accused of fraud, embezzlement, treason, lecherous relations with the court ladies, accepting bribes, and trying to reestablish Catholicism. The Jewish community tried unsuccessfully to ransom him. After a heavily publicized trial during which no proofs of his guilt were produced, he was sentenced to death. When his jailers demanded that he convert to Christianity, he refused. He was taken to the gallows on 4 February 1738, and given a final chance to convert to Christianity, which he refused to do."

        "content": "Although the story of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph S\u00fc\u00df Oppenheimer constituted a relatively obscure episode in German history, it became the subject of a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud S\u00fc\u00df (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrawn. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of S\u00fc\u00df to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly struck by the fact that S\u00fc\u00df could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety. Ashley Dukes and Paul Kornfeld wrote dramatic adaptations of the Feuchtwanger novel. A German-born American director, Lothar Mendes, directed a British film adaptation of the novel in 1934.  This film (entitled Power in the U.S.) starred Conrad Veidt, and was an early effort to expose Nazi anti-semitism. It prompted the Nazi propaganda ministry to make their own version of the film, which starred the distinguished German star Werner Krauss, who had played the title role in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."

Scrawled in lipstick on a nearby mirror are the words \"You made me do this.\" One year later, the most exclusive and cruel sorority on campus, headed by Stephanie (Holly Madison), is in the final days of rush. For their final task, the three remaining pledges are required to tell the scariest story they know. The first pledge, Tonya (Jessica Noboa), tells a true story she heard from a friend. In the story, Lily (Rebekah Kochan), is a beautiful blonde that lives with her boyfriend Tommy (Ryan Freeman) and his ex-girlfriend, Sarah, from England. Tommy works at a coffee shop, and finds a doll in a dumpster one day, which he brings home to Lily. At first, Lily thinks that Sarah has done something to the doll to mess with her. The doll kills Sarah first, stabbing her to death, then electrocutes Lily. The story ends with Tonya saying Tommy was convicted for the murders and was put away for life. The girls think that the story is good and take a shot. The second story, told by Phoebe (Stephanie Sanborn), is about a former A-list actress, Eva DeMarco (Bridget Marquardt), who wants to be back on top. So she accepts a role from an elusive filmmaker (John D'Aquino) in a desolate region in Romania. However, the film crew has a deadly secret. Eva is drugged and has a dream where she's in a jail cell and killed by an angel with black wings (Christine Nguyen). When she wakes up, she goes to a dinner party for the shoot of the movie, where she discovers that all of the crew members are dead, and that they make snuff films. Eva is killed and becomes the newest member of the group. Again, the sorority girls like Phoebe's story and take another shot. Finally, it is Haley's (Jean-Louise O'Sullivan) turn. She tells a story about a group of three girls, based on Stephanie, Amber, and Roxy. The story begins at the girls' home; the girls are about to go see a movie while their cable is being fixed. The girls come back home after one of them forgot to buy tickets in advance. Another girl suggests making prank calls. They call a man and tell him that he has won seven free pizzas. During the call, the man goes to answer the door and is killed. The girls overhear the man being killed and hesitantly call the police. The girls don't trust the cop who shows up, since he is by himself. After a killing spree occurs, only Anna and the cop remain. Anna kills the cop out of terror, thinking he is the killer. After shooting him five times, she walks into the hallway, where the real killer is waiting. She is promptly killed. After all of the girls tell their stories, it is time for the sorority sisters to make their decision. First, Stephanie reveals the two newest members selected for their sorority are two other girls, Stacie and Rachel, who were inducted in a private rush separate from the official rush that Tonya, Phoebe, and Haley just underwent. Stephanie derides the three pledges for thinking that they could become members of the sorority. But then the sorority sisters start feeling the ill effects of the poisoned cookies provided by Haley. Haley, who turns out to be Brianna's half-sister, became a pledge solely to get close enough to the sorority (that she blames for Brianna's suicide) to kill them. She walks away from the sorority house, accompanied by her mother."

This is interspersed with documentary footage of real cricket games. Sam desperately wants his son Reggie to be there at The Oval to witness his last match, but Reggie has a developing passion for poetry and instead of attending the game has a \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 chance of meeting a leading poet, Alexander Whitehead. But when Reggie meets Whitehead, it turns out he is a huge fan of cricket.  Whitehead takes Reggie along to the match, in time to see Sam's innings, and persuades Reggie that there is more to cricket than he had previously thought. In Sam's final appearance he is dismissed leg before wicket. As he walks back to the pavilion the other players line his route and the spectators give him a standing ovation."

        "content": "In Sicily in 1486, a mob of villagers torture and crucify five nuns, suspected of witchcraft, in a chamber beneath their convent. At a seance in Toronto in 1990, Liza (Meg Register) has a vision of the crucified nuns and falls screaming onto the floor. Several months later. Liza and Professor Evans (Brett Halsey), a respected archaeologist and her former professor, lead a survey team to Ancient Greek ruins on a site near the small town of Santa Rosalia, Sicily. The locals, including Porter (Al Cliver) and Turi (Lino Salemme) tell them to avoid the beautiful but ominous ruins of a monastery that overlooks the dig. Although Professor Evans reminds her that she should avoid any involvement with the supernatural after the seance in Toronto,  Liza is fascinated by the morbid rumors about what had happened in the monastery. Ignoring Turi's angry rebuke, Liza enters the monastery crypt. Convinced that there is another chamber behind a wall, she uses a pick-axe to break into the cavern containing the charred remains of the five nuns. But when Liza tells Professor Evans what she has found, he angrily tells her to forget she saw anything. Soon, supernatural murders begin to take place. Porter is killed on his boat by a harpoon gun-wielding spectral nun. Two members of the archaeological team, Sean (Grady Thomas Clarkson) and Kevin (Pascal Druant), are lured into the ruins by enticing female voices and then killed when they fall through a weak floorboard and land into a pit of metal spikes. Eventually, Inspector Carter (Lucio Fulci) from Interpol arrives to investigate the deaths. Meanwhile, Liza pursues her investigation into the monastery She meets with a strange-looking woman (Carla Cassola) who tells her about what happened at the ruins centuries ago. The nuns practiced witchcraft and held orgies there as well. Local youths wound be invited there for sex, then murdered as they reached orgasm. The nuns would drink their blood in a satanic frenzy. If any one of the crazed nuns would become pregnant, they would carry their unwanted babies to full term, then throw the newborns onto a fire. After Liza leaves, the old woman is clawed to death by her pet cats. Professor Evans puts suspicion on Turi the butcher, who has openly threatened violence against the archaeologists. But that evening, Turi is killed in the freezer of his meat shop. Inspector Carter finds a piece of torn clothing clutched in Turi's right hand which apparently belonged to his killer. Now under suspicion himself for Turi's murder, Professor Evans decides the dig will be abandoned, but Liza, acting more and more strangely, refuses to leave. The next morning, the enraged townspeople attack the haunted ruins, Professor Evans tries to get his team clear. But he realizes that Liza and Robby, the young son of two team members, are missing. Robby has been kidnapped by a white-robed, faceless nun. He manages to escape but, just outside of the camp, sees his father ripped in two by a hidden trap. Professor Evans pursues Liza, who is dressed in a white robe and possessed by the spirits of the evil nuns, into the ruins. She stabs him in the stomach and then disappears like a ghost. The mob of townspeople charge into the hidden chamber. Liza reappears, foaming at the mouth on one of the crosses. The mob sets her and all the skeletal remains of the nuns afire. The wounded Professor Evans staggers into the cavern, pushing the mob members out of his way, to see Liza materialize at the foot of the burning crosses, no longer possessed but dead."

        "content": "In Ghazni Province, Afghanistan, a U.S. Army Special Forces team consisting of team leader Chief Warrant Officer  Wally Hamer, Master-Sergeant Kenny Tanner, and Sergeants Vince Degetau,  Joe Trinoski, Tim Cole, and Pete Sadler meets CIA Agent Benjamin Keynes, who indicates that their mission is to find a very important Afghan cleric by the name of Mohammed Aban. Hamer, briefs the men to be ready. After being inserted, the team finds a local guide, Abdul, in a village in Southern Afghanistan, where Aban is from. Together, they go to the mountains, where the cleric has a reputation for hiding. As they go further into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing multiple gunmen, but when they check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling to move up the mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, seems to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly stops (something that shouldn't be physically possible). Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like Persian or Arabic, but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski's body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski's body strewn out across rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain's surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man's robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth-century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan's mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself, but when Cole looks through his night vision goggles, he sees a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. Degeteau develops horrible stomach pains. As he tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is filled with sand, as are the containers of everyone else. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that wasn't there previously. Tensions further increase when the team encounters a bright light at night. As Tanner and Cole try to flank the light, believing it to be a ruse by the Taliban, they're immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that is beyond human conception and has deadly consequences; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff. As the team progresses further and tensions among the men increase, the remaining soldiers confront Keynes and demand the truth. Keynes shows them a recording from his thermal imaging camera and informs them about the real motive. The thermal video shows a triangular object in the desert. Being nearly invisible to the naked eye, it lifts off the ground after three (supposed) men, including Mohammed Aban, walk to it and vanishes right in front of Keynes' eyes. It was this object that killed the men. The CIA has been monitoring this phenomenon since 1980 and sent Keynes and the special forces team there to further investigate it. The whole time, Keynes has been recording with his special thermal camera and sending the images to Langley via an advanced laser aimed at CIA satellites. Keynes theorizes that this object originates from an ancient Indian mythology called 'Vimanas', a sort of UFO-related phenomenon that occurred when Alexander the Great rode through this area of land as he was conquering, and the bright lights and the ghostly gunmen are associated with it. He also explains that the team is an 'expendable' for the investigation and they will not be rescued, which causes a brief scuffle with the agitated team leader, who disappears the next morning. Running out of ammunition, water and food, the team wanders further into the desert where they finally encounter the vimanas at what appears to be the location that the British regiment was destroyed. Sadler, overwhelmed with fear, opens fire upon the seemingly invisible vimanas only to be vaporized. Keynes flees with Degetau and abandons him later, as he is too sick to continue, and later hears his screams before being obliterated by the objects. Exhausted and traumatized, Keynes searches for water. He encounters an oasis and drinks water from it only to discover the body of Hamer laying next to the water. Unable to grasp the horror, he passes out. When he wakes up in the night, he hears the distant sound of a helicopter and fires his flare gun. Simultaneously, several flares fire up from the valley. The bright light he encountered earlier re-appears and two beings from it approach him. As it touches his forehead, he sees visions and hallucinations of various objects and landscapes from his previous encounters, causing him to go into a trance. In the final scene he is shown floating several inches above a bed with a talisman he took from Aban's home in his hand, inside a hospital room, where doctors and a military colonel are watching him through a glass window. In a trance, he finally whispers, \"It will save us all...\" In the final credits, interviews of Keynes' wife are shown in which she says that the family has not yet been informed about him and concludes him to be missing."

After seeing some of Tian's work (notably 1982's Red Elephant, which Tian had co-directed), Yan sent his screenplay to the director, who at the time was working with Ling Zifeng as an assistant director on the older man's film, The Border Town. Tian liked the story and particularly its humanistic portrayal of the years in which Tian himself had grown up, but he was immediately turned off by the film's second half, which glorified the Communist Party of China. Taking on the project, Tian changed parts of Yan's screenplay, including the ending. These changes, however, were seen by the film's producers as a negative portrayal of the People's Republic's earliest years. As a result, Tian's inserted scenes were cut leading the director to feel that much of his vision was ultimately compromised. In contrast to his earlier works, September also marked Tian Zhuangzhuang's first official run-in with Chinese censors, although Chinese television had refused to air his short film, Our Corner which he co-directed while still in the Beijing Film Academy."

The teleplay of the episode was written by series creator Chris Carter, from a story by former series star David Duchovny, Carter, and executive producer Frank Spotnitz; the entry was directed by Duchovny. \"William\" helps to explore the series' overarching mythology. The episode received a Nielsen household rating of 5.8, being watched by 6.1 million households and 9.3 million viewers upon its initial broadcast. It received mixed reviews from television critics, many of whom were unhappy with the episode's conclusion. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett finds a strange, disfigured man (Chris Owens) in the X-Files office and, on his whim, they test his DNA. They learn that the man shares DNA with Fox Mulder (Duchovny), and may possibly even be him. The answers become even more surprising when Scully's son, baby William, is put on the line. \"William\" marked the return of David Duchovny to the series, after his departure following the eighth season finale \"Existence\". The genesis for the episode was a storyline Duchovny had developed during the series' eighth season; he originally pitched an idea featuring a mysteriously disfigured person introducing himself to Scully and admitting that he possessed a connection to Mulder. Chris Owens, whose character Jeffrey Spender had previously been killed off in the sixth season episode \"One Son\", was asked to return to the series for the episode."

The episode then jumps back a week. Scully takes William out of her car while an unknown man (Chris Owens) watches them. Later, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) is attacked in the X-Files office by the same man. After a struggle, Doggett subdues him. His face is revealed to be horribly scarred. Later, Scully speaks with the man. He claims he received his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that he was sent to the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway. Scully is told by the scarred man that William is part alien and that she is being used to raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the hospital and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group. Scully muses over Spender's words and decides that the only way to truly protect William is to give him up for adoption so that he may have a better life. The episode then jumps to the Van De Kamps, who tuck in their new son. William looks at his mobile but he can no longer move it telekinetically, an event which happened in \"Nothing Important Happened Today\"."

In fact, Duchovny makes a cameo appearance in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. The genesis for the episode was a storyline Duchovny had developed during the series' eighth season. He had originally pitched an idea featuring a mysteriously disfigured person introducing himself to Scully and admitting that he has a connection to Mulder. Reportedly, the idea for Scully to give William up for adoption was mandated by Carter and Spotnitz. Duchovny, Anderson, and executive producer John Shiban were not happy with this turn of events, due to them being parents and feeling that the action was not realistic. In the end, they \"grudgingly consented\". Three years after Spender had been written out of the series\u2014in the sixth season episode \"One Son\"\u2014and actor Chris Owens had moved to Toronto, Ontario, in Canada, Owens received an unexpected phone call from David Duchovny, who said that The X-Files production crew was filming the series' finale as well as another episode late in the season, and that he wanted to bring Spender back for these two episodes. Duchovny reassured Owens that Spender's survival would be explained away via the plot device of an alien injection but mentioned that the experience would not be fun for Owens, as he would be \"under all that shit\"; Owens did not realize what Duchovny meant until he got to the studio and personally saw the makeup for Spender's disfigured appearance, a sight that shocked Owens."

The episode received a Nielsen rating of 7.1 and was viewed by 11.7 million viewers. Overall, the episode received largely negative reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)\u2014following the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)\u2014who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Doggett and Scully encounter a dead man who is still living\u2014only somewhat changed. What they discover is a man made of metal, enacting vengeance on those he believes created him. \"Salvage\" was loosely based on Tetsuo: The Iron Man, a 1989 Japanese cyberpunk film by cult-film director Shinya Tsukamoto. Written by Jeffrey Bell before Robert Patrick was cast as agent Doggett, the film coincidentally echoes the plot of the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which Patrick starred in. Indeed, the episode contains an explicit reference to Patrick's role, written in homage. The episode contained several elaborate special effects sequences, most notably in the teaser, wherein a man stops a car with his body."

Curtis, grievously injured, looks up at the man and says, \u201cRay?\u201d The man\u2019s arm slams through the windshield as Curtis screams. Agents Scully and Doggett investigate the crash. Scully suggests a man stopped the car but Doggett points out that it would have required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario\u2019s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man\u2019s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario\u2019s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Then Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe that Ray could be involved in Curtis\u2019s death. Later, Ray Pearce eats at a halfway house as volunteer, Larina Jackson, bothers him. She tries to reach out to help him but he is completely uninterested in talking with her.

Ray\u2019s detached arm begins to rebuild itself with metal. Harry is transfixed by this sight as Ray kills him.

Scully discusses Ray Pearce with Doggett. Scully wonders: if Pearce has become a 'metal man' \"how can he be stopped?\" Pearce later arrives at Chamber Technologies. Dr. Pugovel, one of the scientists working there, lures him into a containment chamber and then Doggett, Scully, and SWAT team members surround it. He eventually tears his way out of the back of the chamber. Nora waits for Ray in the halfway house. Ray explains that he didn\u2019t come home because he isn\u2019t himself anymore. Ray turns angrily to her and says, \"They've got to pay for this. They've all got to pay.\" Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, inside of which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had requested that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident. When Nora arrives home, Ray shows up demanding the name of the person responsible. She tells him that the man responsible is Owen Harris. Ray finds Harris, along with his family, and nearly kills him. However, he realizes that Harris was an accountant who accidentally sent the barrel to the salvage yard. Seeing that he was ultimately innocent, Ray spares him and goes off to die. Scully believes that this act represented the last of Ray\u2019s humanity. At the very end of the episode, a car is dropped into a compactor at a salvage yard and crushed. As the camera fades out, Ray's eye is seen, still alive as the car is crushed."

        "content": "\"Salvage\" was written by X-Files staff writer Jeffrey Bell and was \"loosely\" based on Tetsuo: The Iron Man, a 1989 Japanese cyberpunk film by cult-film director Shinya Tsukamoto. The idea to write an episode about a man whose body is made completely out of \"dense metal alloys\" was developed by Bell before actor Robert Patrick joined the show. Robert Patrick had previously played the role of a liquid-metal T-1000 android assassin in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In fact, Patrick had been cast as Agent Doggett by the executives in a hope that his role in the movie would appeal to the 18\u201334 male demographic, upon which advertising prices are based. Fox had anticipated a 10 percent increase in viewership with the addition of Patrick. Indeed, the episode contains an explicit reference to Patrick's role, written in homage: after hearing Scully's theory, Doggett replies, \"What\u2019re you saying? Ray Pearce has become some kind of metal man? 'Cause that only happens in the movies, Agent Scully.\" With the filming and airing of \"Salvage\", Robert Patrick began to feel \"comfortable in his new role\". He later recalled that \"we started seeing our [ratings] numbers. Our numbers were good, and everyone was happy.\" Several of the characters and locations were named or based after real individuals and places. The three scientists: Chamber, Clifton, and Pugovel, were named after friends of Bell's, who were engineers. Much of the action was based in Muncie, Indiana. Bell picked this location because it was the hometown of his grandparents."

        "content": "Two months have passed since a strain of mad cow disease mutated into \"mad person disease\" that became \"mad zombie disease\", which overran the entire United States (with the infection presumably spreading to the rest of the world), turning many Americans into vicious zombies. Survivors of the zombie epidemic have learned that growing attached to other survivors is not advisable because they could die at any moment, so many have taken to using their city of origin as nicknames. Lonely college student Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is making his way from his college dorm in Austin, Texas, to Columbus, Ohio, to see whether his parents are still alive. He encounters Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), another survivor, who is particularly aggressive when killing zombies. Though he does not appear to be friendly, Tallahassee reluctantly allows Columbus to travel with him. Tallahassee mentions he misses his puppy, \"Buck\" that was killed by zombies, as well as his addiction to Twinkies, which he actively tries to find. The pair meets Wichita (Emma Stone) and her younger sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters turn out to be con artists and trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons by pretending that Little Rock is infected by the disease, then stealing their Escalade. The two men find a yellow Hummer H2 loaded with weapons and go after the sisters. However, the girls spring another trap for them and take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus intervenes saying that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them. The sisters reveal that they are going to the Pacific Playland amusement park in Los Angeles, an area supposedly free of zombies. After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely killed, Columbus decides to accompany the others to California. Along the trip, Columbus persists in trying to impress and woo Wichita. When the group reaches Hollywood, Tallahassee directs them to the mansion of Bill Murray. Tallahassee and Wichita meet Murray himself, uninfected but disguised as a zombie so he can walk safely around town. Murray is killed when Columbus shoots him, mistaking him for a real zombie during a practical joke while watching Ghostbusters with Little Rock. Columbus realizes during a game of Monopoly that \"Buck\" was not Tallahassee's puppy, but his young son, who had become infected and died as a result. Wichita and Columbus become increasingly attracted to each other, and Tallahassee bonds with Little Rock, with whom he was previously feuding. Despite Wichita's attraction to Columbus, she fears attachment and leaves with Little Rock for Pacific Playland the next morning. Columbus decides to go after Wichita and convinces Tallahassee to join him. At Pacific Playland, the sisters activate all the rides and lights so they can enjoy the park, only to unwittingly draw the attention of a multitude of zombies in the surrounding area. A chase ensues, and just as the sisters are trapped on a drop tower ride, Tallahassee and Columbus arrive. Tallahassee lures the zombies away, creating a distraction for Columbus to get to the tower ride; both using the attractions to their advantage. Tallahassee eventually locks himself in a game booth, shooting zombies as they arrive. Columbus successfully evades and shoots through several zombies to reach the tower and help the girls down, but not before changing one of his rules for survival to conquer his fear of clowns while facing off against a clown zombie. As a show of gratitude, Wichita kisses Columbus and reveals her real name: Krista. As the group leaves Pacific Playland, Columbus realizes that without relating to other people, one might as well be a zombie and that he now has what he has always wanted\u2014a family."

The 182nd overall episode of the series, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 11, 2009. In the episode, Kenny and his new girlfriend are encouraged by the Jonas Brothers to wear purity rings, which is secretly a marketing tactic by Disney to sell sex to young girls. The episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA-L in the United States. It was the first South Park episode to premiere in 16:9 and high definition. Parker and Stone were not very familiar with the Jonas Brothers before they wrote \"The Ring\", which was inspired by the recent release of Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. The two argued over whether to open the season with this episode or an episode focusing on the economic recession (\"Margaritaville\"), but eventually decided they needed more time to craft a script for the latter. \"The Ring\" portrays Disney as a corporation using the ruse of family-friendly morals to disguise their primary motive of profit, particularly through the portrayal of Mickey Mouse as a foul-mouthed, greedy, and physically violent company president. The episode received generally positive reviews, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was seen by 3.41 million viewers the week it was broadcast. The publicist for the Jonas Brothers specifically forbade reporters from asking the band about the episode; although Nick Jonas said they did not watch it, he did say it was an honor to be included in the show. \"The Ring\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010."

Butters hears a rumor that Tammy is a slut because she gave another male student a \"B.J.\" in a T.G.I. Friday's parking lot. Hoping to spare Kenny's feelings, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman decide to warn him, but are bewildered when Kenny reacts excitedly and happily. Kenny invites Tammy to go with him to T.G.I. Friday's after school, whereupon she confesses and confirms the rumor. Ignoring his delight, she explains that she did it only because she became aroused after watching the Jonas Brothers perform. Consequently, Kenny, hoping she will give him a \"B.J.\" as well, takes Tammy to a Jonas Brothers concert at the Pepsi Center. His friends are disgusted by his intent; Cartman claims that \"the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman.\" After the concert, Tammy and several other girls are invited backstage, assuming the Jonas Brothers want to have sex with them. Instead, they convince the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, and tell them to get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because \"That is just the way we roll\" (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny subsequently becomes dull and ceases spending time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity rings by their fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed boss, Mickey Mouse, who verbally berates them when they complain that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey even brutally assaults Joe Jonas after he and his brothers threaten to refuse performing due to Mickey's demands for them to wear and promote their purity rings, explaining that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while falsely promoting innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver, but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage. When the boys regain consciousness, they are backstage at the Televised Jonas Brothers' 3D concert spectacular at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens them with a chainsaw, refusing to believe they are not working for another company. As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions, this time insulting the Jonas Brothers' fans and Christians, Kyle stealthily turns on one of the microphones and Cartman raises the curtain, broadcasting Mickey's rant to both the concert-goers and the national television audience. When Mickey realizes that the curtains are raised and everyone heard him, the crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in a huff. An enraged Mickey inflates and begins blowing fire and destroying most of Denver. Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings, and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday's, greatly exciting Kenny. The show immediately cuts to Kenny's funeral, where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a blowjob from Tammy and died as a result. As the episode closes, Cartman restates how the American woman has \"the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet\"."

It was first broadcast on March 11, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central, and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom. It was the first episode of South Park'''s thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high-definition (HD). Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession, which they had been planning to do for some time. Stone argued they should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. An episode about the economy entitled \"Margaritaville\" was shown later in the season. By March 8, three days before the episode premiered, the script was only half-finished and the animation was not yet complete, in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last-minute deadlines; Stone said of the practice, \"We don't do a live show, but we kind of harness some of that energy. We kind of need that to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'\" The Jonas Brothers characters were voiced by Parker and Stone, with Parker providing the voices for Kevin and Nick, and Stone voicing Joe, although the two switched characters on some lines. Parker also provides the voice of Mickey Mouse in \"The Ring\". Parker and Stone were inspired to make the episode by the Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience film, which was released the previous month. Because they were unfamiliar with the band, they spent a large amount of time watching Jonas Brothers concert clips online, which they found unoriginal and not very enjoyable. Parker said one of the Comedy Central employees told them that after she took her young daughter to see the concert film, the girl said, \"Mommy, my giney tickles\". Parker thought the story was hilarious and worked the exact line into the episode."

The Comanche have placed a protective spear in the ground to contain the evil, along with a rabbit foot talisman for good luck. A young boy pulls the spear from the ground while pocketing the talisman. He starts to play with the spear. A Comanche catches the boy, and startled, he runs away with the rabbit's foot. The Native American places the spear back, realizing too late that the rabbits foot is now gone. After that, white men come and start drilling for oil. Skip to current time, a divorced father, Mance Cashen, moves to the area with his new wife and baby. His son from his first marriage, Willy, is visiting. Willy notices something peculiar in the house and tries to warn his father and step-mother. They do not believe him. Willy is attacked while on a tire swing over a small water hole. The creature grabs his foot and Willy struggles, eventually getting away. He eventually befriends the local drunk, T. C. van Houten, the same man who rented the house to Mance and his wife. A nice old man with some bad memories who knows something about the evil near the oil well and was in a situation similar to Willy's. In the meantime a Comanche Indian chief, Chief Sam John, comes to warn Mance of the evil and the need to keep it contained. Sam John informs Mance the evil was originally intended to stop the white man, but it is indiscriminate in whom it kills instead. Mance will have none of it. Willy eventually takes a spear he finds on his property to Sam John and tries to find out what is going on. Sam John convinces Willy to promise to stay out of the cellar and come get him if anything happens. Sam John is later dragged into the cellar by the monster. Willy, of course, has plans of his own and sets booby traps in the basement. He plans to trap it in sight so he can prove he is not lying. As he lays the traps the creature gives him a scare and Willy runs away. T. C. dies shortly after by the evil. Willy decides to be more bold and makes another trip to the basement in order to stop the monster. This time armed with a flame thrower, electrical cables, and a lucky rabbit\u2019s foot. The monster interrupts him and Willy must run away again. Willy takes Mance's ex-boss's son, Tommy Boatwright, with him to the water hole in order to set up bait for the monster. Tommy falls in and the monster eats him. The police suspect foul play from Mance on account of him being fired. While looking for his son, under the impression he has merely run away, Tommy's father, Kyle goes into the cellar of the Cashen's house, but is caught in a bear trap that was meant for the creature and the creature itself kills Kyle. Having enough of Willy's 'lying', Mance locks Willy in the kitchen with the cellar door nailed open to scare him into reality only to find out Willy was telling the truth. Willy electrocutes the monster, saving his dad. But the monster is only stunned. Mance disappears and Willy, his step-mom, and the baby escape to the car. Mance escapes through the tunnels to the water hole. Willy grabs some dynamite and rigs it up to a toy car to kill the monster, but the explosives aren't working. Mance decides to once again go back to the cellar and hook up the explosives, barely escaping with his life. Mance and Willy blow the monster up together while escaping."

        "content": "\"The Coon\" is the second episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series South Park. The 183rd episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 18, 2009. In the episode, Cartman poses as a comic book superhero vigilante named \"The Coon\", who grows increasingly jealous of the popularity and success of a rival superhero named \"Mysterion\". The episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It was originally conceived as an episode about the economic recession, but those elements were later adapted into the future episode, \"Margaritaville\". \"The Coon\" generated a great deal of speculation about the true identity of Mysterion. Parker and Stone originally said there was no specific answer to the question. However, his identity is finally revealed in the fourteenth season episode \"Mysterion Rises\". The episode parodied several dark-toned comic book films that had been recently released at the time, including The Spirit, Watchmen and The Dark Knight. It received generally positive reviews and, according to Nielsen Media Research, was seen by 3.27 million households the week it aired. Comedian Bruce Vilanch, who is mocked in the episode, sent a thank you card to Parker and Stone after the episode aired. \"The Coon\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010. \"The Coon\" was also released on DVD in The Little Box of Butters on September 28, 2010. \"The Coon\" was re-released once more on DVD and Blu-ray as a \"bonus episode\" with the complete fourteenth season."

        "content": "Donning a disguise modeled after a raccoon, Cartman becomes a vigilante dubbed \"The Coon\", who attempts to wipe out crime in South Park. Though Cartman tries to raise awareness about The Coon through word of mouth, nobody pays much attention to the Coon's efforts. When he reports \"crimes\" (such as mistaking a man innocently trying to kiss his date for a rapist) to the police department, he is threatened with jail time and snubbed off. During class, Cartman tries to hype up an appearance from the Coon, saying he will be on the roof of a Walgreens later that evening. Cartman (as the Coon) shows up to the spot to find another child superhero named \"Mysterion\", who is far more successful in garnering appreciation as a crime stopping icon from the police and South Park citizens who want to know just \"Who is Mysterion?\" Cartman is angered by his lack of popularity and the attention Mysterion is receiving. Coon decides to rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as familiar to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten the destruction of a hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no action, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed. Despite the threat of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the television viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives that he is the superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him."

When Quagmire goes to Vermont to buy him a birthday present, they decide to shave James as prank, but it backfires when Peter accidentally kills him. He and Brian decide to hide his body, but are pulled over by the police who, after ignoring Peter's blood stains and beer, arrest Brian when they find him in possession of cannabis. He is bailed out by the family and put on probation for drug use. He attempts to use Stewie's urine when Joe arrives to perform a drug test, only to be caught by Lois, who chastises him for going to such lengths and tells him that he has to change if he intends on doing so. However, Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog. He and Stewie perform an enthusiastic musical number, and soon after the entire town rallies behind them in their cause. Mayor West passes a law to legalize the drug, and everyone (except for Lois, her father, and the kids) starts smoking it; the town has improved as a result, with milestones such as an increase in productivity and a decrease in crime. However, Lois' father, Carter, begins to lose money in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points out that their methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more. Unfortunately for Brian, when his novel is released, it is universally panned by literary critics and does not sell a single copy. Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis (and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is still looking for James and offers a reward of $50. Peter nonchalantly takes the reward, admits that he killed him and slams his door before Quagmire has a chance to react."

The two engage in a few heists together, such as one involving a supermarket and a friendly dog and a Fourth of July robbery of an amusement park during a fireworks show. Ernie is content to live in a tract home on the fringe of the city, but Mike can't resist using his newfound money for material items, and his firing from the mechanic shop only serves to drive a wedge between the two. Ernie maintains a steady, paying relationship with a prostitute, Delphine (Lorraine Toussaint), who fixes Mike up with her apprentice, Carrie (Sheila Kelley). Their relationship does not last long, however, as Mike's desire for her to not need to use her body for money lead her to leave him. The film also features a pair of retired crooks, Ernie's card-playing pals, Johnny (Albert Salmi) and Shoes (Harry Carey), and a pair of adversarial lawyers (Maury Chaykin and Stephen Tobolowsky). Mike's newfound wealth perks the suspicions of the authorities, and he has to try to not turn in Ernie in order to get a lighter sentence. Instead, he admits to his crimes alongside ones that Ernie did, which garners him a nine-year sentence but keeps his friendship with Ernie intact."

John Sayles normally directed his own scripts but did not do this one because he did not feel he had the sense of humor to bring it off. Forsyth too, normally directed his own scripts, but took on Breaking In in an attempt to make contact with a larger mainstream audience: I can't get away with making $6- or $7-million movies (e.g., \"Local Hero\" and \"Housekeeping\") with the kind of audience that my past movies have reached. I've just got to find an audience-or retreat. And I'm quite happy to retreat, I'm happy to go back to Scotland and make smaller movies\"-e.g., \"Gregory's Girl.\" \"But at the same time, `Breaking In' seemed a comfortable experiment for me.

The van has Korean writing on it which translates to \"Hallelujah Church of Scranton.\" This routine, in addition to their regular duties at the Michael Scott Paper Company, takes such a toll on the group that they decide to look into hiring a delivery person. They are told by their accountant that because of their low prices and fixed-cost pricing model, they not only cannot afford a delivery person, but will be completely bankrupt in another month. Pam reveals to her coworkers that she has committed a great deal of money to her upcoming wedding and has had no response to the weekend part-time job applications she's submitted. Ryan responds by confessing that he actually went to Fort Lauderdale instead of Thailand. At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) announces that the Scranton branch, previously the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton to see what can be done to stem the losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) also be present because he had been Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting, Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees into Michael's office. David decides the cheapest option is for Dunder Mifflin to buy out the Michael Scott Paper Company. Jim has learned the company's financial situation from Pam but feigns uncertainty when asked if Michael is likely to be interested in a buyout. At David and Charles's orders, Jim brings the idea of a buyout to Michael, reassuring Michael that Dunder Mifflin is unaware of his company's financial situation. Dwight learns from a past client that Michael has been begging customers for more money and informs Charles, but Jim manipulates their conversation so that Charles refuses to listen, having been embarrassed by Dwight's earlier ideas. Michael, Pam and Ryan come in to discuss the terms of the buyout. After Michael rejects an initial offer of $12,000 to buy the company, David suggests that he is bluffing, saying he knows that his company's prices are too low to be sustainable. Michael keeps his cool and rebuts that Dunder Mifflin's best branch is \"bleeding\" and David could be replaced during an upcoming major stockholder meeting as a result. David gives a second offer of $60,000, which is strongly considered, but Michael rejects this offer at the last second and demands the company give him his old job back and hire Ryan and Pam as salespeople. David is reluctant to hire three people with full benefits, especially given Ryan's disastrous history with the company, and likens it to \"a multimillion-dollar buyout\". Michael refuses to back down, and David reluctantly agrees to his demands. As Charles leaves Scranton, returning to corporate, Michael does not allow him to have any final words, mirroring Charles's earlier treatment of Michael when he quit."

        "content": "An unnamed widow lives alone with her only son, selling medicinal herbs in a small town in southern South Korea while conducting unlicensed acupuncture treatments for the town's women on the side. Her son, Yoon Do-joon, is shy, but prone to attacking anyone who mocks his intellectual disability. She dotes on him and scolds him for hanging out with Jin-tae, a local thug. When Do-joon is nearly hit by a car, he and Jin-tae vandalize the car and attack the driver and passengers as revenge. Jin-tae blames Do-joon for the damage done to the car, and Do-joon is sued. His mother struggles with the burden of the debt. On his way home from a bar late at night, Do-joon sees a high school girl named Moon Ah-jung walking alone and follows her to an abandoned building. The next morning, she is discovered dead on the rooftop, shocking the town and pressuring the incompetent police to find the killer. Only circumstantial evidence places Do-joon near the scene of the crime, but the police arrest the boy anyway. He is tricked into signing a confession and faces a long prison sentence. His mother, believing him innocent, tries to prove he is not the murderer. However, she is unsuccessful, as the lawyer she hires is self-absorbed and unhelpful and the community unanimously blames Do-joon for the crime. The mother suspects Jin-tae of committing the murder and breaks into his house to look for evidence. She takes a golf club, which she believes has blood on it, but when she turns it over to the police and Jin-tae is confronted about it, it becomes clear that the \"blood\" is just smeared lipstick. Despite her accusation, Jin-tae agrees to help the mother solve the casefor a fee. The mother fires her lawyer and questions the people in town about Ah-jung. They tell her the girl was sexually promiscuous and in a relationship with a boy known as Jong-pal, who had escaped a sanatorium. Do-joon attacks another prisoner who calls him \"retard\". On one of his mother's prison visits, Do-joon recalls a memory of her attempt to kill him and then herself when he was five by lacing their drinks with a pesticide. She tries to apologize, saying she wanted to free them both from hardship. She offers to remove his pain by using her unique knowledge of an acupuncture point that erases bad memories, but he tells her he never wants to see her again. The mother learns from a camera-shop worker that Ah-jung had frequent nosebleeds and had pictures on her cellphone that she wanted to have printed. Ah-jung's friend is attacked by two young men who are looking for the phone, but the mother rescues her and then pays Jin-tae to interrogate the men, who claim that Ah-jung accepted rice in exchange for sex (and was nicknamed \"the rice cake girl\"). They say she used her phone to secretly take pictures of her partners, thus making it a potential tool for blackmailing. The mother tracks down the phone, which is hidden at Ah-jung's grandmother's house. Do-joon remembers seeing an elderly man in the abandoned building on the night of Ah-jung's death and identifies him in one of the pictures on Ah-jung's phone. The mother recognizes the man as a junk collector she once bought an umbrella from and goes to his home to find out what he saw, on the pretense of offering him charity medical services. The junk collector reveals that he has been troubled since he saw Do-joon kill Ah-jung. He witnessed the two have a short conversation, during which Ah-jung called Do-joon a \"retard\", and Do-joon then threw a large rock into the shadows in which Ah-jung was standing, hitting her in the head and inadvertently killing her. Do-joon then dragged her to the rooftop. The mother is unable to accept the truth. She frantically tells the junk collector that he is wrong and the case is going to be reopened and Do-joon will be released, which prompts him to pick up the phone to finally report what he had seen to the police. Fearing for her son, the mother bludgeons the junk collector with a wrench and sets fire to his house. Later, the police tell the mother that they have found the \"real\" killer: Jong-pal, who is being presumed guilty after Ah-jung's blood was found on his shirt. The police assume it got there during the murder, but the mother knows Jong-pal's story, that the blood is the result of Ah-jung's nose bleeding during consensual sex, is true. Feeling guilty, she visits Jong-pal, who is even more intellectually disabled than her son, and cries for him when she hears he does not have a mother to fight for him, knowing he is going to jail for a crime he did not commit. Do-joon is freed from prison and Jin-tae picks him up. They pass the junk collector's burned-down house on the way home and stop to pick through the rubble. During dinner, Do-joon muses to his mother that Jong-pal probably dragged Ah-jung up to the roof so that someone would see she was hurt and help her. As the mother is about to depart from a bus station on a \"Thank-You Parents\" tour, Do-joon returns her acupuncture kit, which he found in the remains of the junk collector's house, and tells her to be more careful. She tearfully walks away, jarred by his discovery. On the bus, she sits in shock before placing one of the acupuncture needles in the point that erases bad memories. She stands up and dances with the other passengers."

His father (Walter Pidgeon), a retired colonel, is glad to have his son back despite grieving over the death of his other son, Pete. Pete's widow, Aggie Hall (Anne Francis), confides to her friend Caroline (Cloris Leachman) it is difficult to be around her brother-in-law without painful reminders of her lost husband. A welcome-home party is held for Capt. Hall, surprising Colonel Dudley Smith (Fay Roope), a friend of Ed, Sr. He finds out that Capt. Hall's father is unaware that his son is about to be tried in a court-martial for collaboration with the enemy. Hall's father asks his son if the charges are true, and receives a stark, simple, reply: \"yes, I did\". Ed Sr. cruelly challenges his son: \"Why didn't you just die?\" Major Sam Moulton (Wendell Corey) prosecutes the case. He calls eyewitnesses who testify that at the POW camp in the winter of 1951, Hall made speeches and signed documents on the enemy's behalf. A fellow prisoner and much-decorated officer, Capt. John Miller (Lee Marvin), reveals scars received from enemy inflicted torture, but claims he never conceded to his captors anything but his name, rank and serial number. In unguarded comments on the stand Miller calls Hall a coward. Capt. Hall has his sister-in-law's support, but his father initially refuses even to attend the trial. Hall is disconsolate and wishes to plead guilty. But his lawyer, Lt. Col. Frank Wasnick (Edmond O'Brien), persuades him to take the witness stand and explain his actions. In stark detail, Capt. Hall discloses the torture he underwent. This includes how he was ordered to bury other soldiers, dead or alive; how he carried a wounded man for four days so he wouldn't collapse and be placed in a grave; solitary confinement for months at a time, denied light and company and forced to live in his own excrement. Facing repeated demands to read propaganda statements, Hall relented but wrote one himself, using language that attempted to mock the enemy's purpose. Hall experienced a breaking point when the enemy delivered a letter from his father, revealing his brother Pete's death. Hall's father, who finally attends the trial, is devastated by his son's testimony about his breaking point. He forgives his son, but the official judgment is less kind. Hall is found guilty of treason and the film closes with Hall's contrition on the witness stand."

The screenplay of The Cycle is adapted from the novel \"Junkyard\" of the series \"Grave and Cradle\". Mehrjui achieves a perfect social realism in The Cycle. A large part of this success is, like The Cow, from Sa'edi's writing. Sa'edi cooperated with Mehrjui and the crew during review and even production. Entezami, who portrays Sameri, comments: \"After all, the procedure was like before while you were working with Mehrjui, and the same for the specifics of the character Sameri and his ethical and behavioral attributes; but this time Dr. Sa'edi was present too and every time I worked on a novel by him, it was that way. I always talked to Dr. Sa'edi and used his help.\" The changes that the film has relative to the novel are mostly due to artistic necessities or because of the more restricted censorship in cinema than in books. Javad Tusi writes at the footer of an article about Mehrjui's \"Shirak\" film: \"Sa'edi emphasizes on the fall of the character Ali in the novel Junkyard by stating the cooperation of Ali with SAVAK agents for exposing and arresting the protesting physician of the hospital; but Mehrjui shows the retrograde process of the character Ali in The Cycle by his indifference towards his father's death due to the impossibility of explicitly stating the former during the time.\"  About that, Omid Roshan-Zamir writes: \"Mehrjui has chosen the same realistic style of Sa'edi's in adaptation of this novel and shows the events without redundancy, with a designated method. Due to the circumstances during the time of the production of the film, the part of Ali being a snitch is put aside and instead, the story of a young doctor, who tries to establish a blood laboratory in order to neutralize the blood dealer who sells infected blood to hospitals, is added.\""

Shortly after getting promoted as Regional Manager of Max Finance, Parag Dixit is arrested in Bandra for firing at police and for possession of narcotics. His associate Keshav is grievously injured and is hospitalized in critical condition. Parag's widowed mother, Alka, and Air Hostess girlfriend, Manasi Pandit, retain Advocate Harish Bhatiya (Sandeep Mehta) to represent him at a preliminary bail hearing, but the Judge denies bail. Housed in an overcrowded barrack, having barely any room to move, Parag meets with a variety of people - both convicted and awaiting trial - including: Abdul Ghani (Rahul Singh) - a person waiting for bail after he accidentally killed a man troubling his wife Kabir Malik (Arya Babbar) - a convict and henchman of Bababhai Galib Suratwala, Nawab (Manoj Bajpayee) - a prisoner who now works in the jail Joe D'souza (Ali Quli Mirza) - a person accused of a hit and run accident Bababhai - a Don who stays in a special room and conducts criminal activities by bribing police Parag is tortured mentally by the jail, but he eventually learns to adjust to his new situation. Parag again appears in court after a charge-sheet is filed. Due to the offences' seriousness and the fear of tampering with evidence and witnesses, he is denied bail. Months later, Keshav dies while Parag still awaits trial. In jail, several storylines intertwine. Parag befriends Nawab, who is sympathetic to him. Ghani's wife leaves him, and he agrees to become Bababhai's henchman and is released on bail. Although, he finds out his wife has married another man and proceeds to take his own life. Galib escapes from jail by bribing the police. Joe gets bail and celebrates by donating some of his items which anger Parag, who subsequently beats him up. Parag is transferred to solitary confinement as punishment. After ten days, he is released on request of Nawab. He is sleep-deprived, but he is allowed to go to the hospital to meet his mother and Mansi with the help of Kabir. Nawab is angry at him and requests him to stay away from the gangsters as they demand a lot in return. He narrates the story of how his little brother, under the influence of a gangster, was involved in a murder case, and Nawab was forced to kill him as well as the gangster. Two years later, during Parag's final trial, he is convicted under the Drug Act and is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 10 years, out of which two years he has already served. He, therefore, still has eight years left to serve in prison. Embittered by the abuse and without any faith in the overburdened system, Parag contemplates suicide. Parag asks Kabir to ask Bababhai to help him get out of jail. He agrees to do anything in return. Kabir agrees. A routine transfer of jail is happening; Parag is transferred to Nasik jail and Kabir to Kolhapur. During the transfer, a corrupt police officer places Parag in Kabir's transport. Nawab senses it but stays quiet. During the Nasik jail trip, Kabir and his gang cause an accident and escape, but Parag stays back. Nawab is informed about the events by Jailor Arvind Joshi (Chetan Pandit) and is happy. In Kolhapur jail, Parag tries to regain hope about his life and circumstances. Six months later, Mansi hires a new lawyer (Atul Kulkarni), and Parag appears for retrial in the high court. The new lawyer presents new evidence and points out the flaws committed by the trial court. Parag is acquitted. He and Mansi visit the jail to meet Nawab."

These are three leading citizens who have formed a syndicate to buy and develop his house: the lawyer Lavoisier, the doctor Morasseau, and the butcher Filiol. As he and his mother refuse all offers from this unpleasant trio, the two are subject to continual harassment. One day when Filiol is particularly obnoxious, Louis that night puts sugar in the tank of his car. A resulting accident kills the butcher and brings to town the police detective Lavardin.

The lawyer Lavoisier has a mistress, Anna, who is friendly with the doctor Morasseau's wife, Delphine, but in quick succession both women vanish. After another accident, an unrecognisably charred corpse is recovered from Delphine's car. Deducing that it is in fact that of Anna, Lavardin has to work out where Delphine is and why she has disappeared.

Slaughter gets arrested and charged with first-degree murder, but Treasury Department official Price (Cameron Mitchell) offers to drop all charges if he agrees to go to an unnamed South American country to capture the escaped mobster, who apparently has a super-computer that helps him run his crime empire. Upon arriving, Slaughter meets up with two fellow agents, Harry (Don Gordon) and Kim (Marlene Clark), having previously known Kim. The mobster responsible for the murder of Slaughter's father is Dominic Hoffo (Rip Torn), right-hand man of kingpin Felice (Norman Alfe). Hoffo, a blatant racist and sociopath, instantly hates Slaughter, especially when his comare Ann (Stella Stevens), a professional working for the organization, makes it clear she's delighted to have been ordered by Felice to present herself to Slaughter as a peace offering. Slaughter, having no intention of backing down from his vendetta, accepts Ann's offer with pleasure, and her loyalties quickly transfer to him. Numerous fights and gun battles ensue, with the hot-headed Hoffo eventually killing the more reasonable Felice and assuming command, beating Ann viciously for her disloyalty.

Nina Darnton of The New York Times panned the film as \"an example of a good idea spoiled by a hackneyed, heavy-handed script, awkward directorial pacing, and posed acting. . . The script, while trying to humorously characterize national stereotypes, succeeds only in being insulting.\" Joe Baltake of Philly.com called it \"annoyingly schizophrenic \u2013 thuddingly humorless when it isn't shockingly offensive.\" In a savage review in the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Goldstein argued that an \"awkward\" and \"uneven\" script, \"a paucity of intriguing characters\", and an overwrought soundtrack of quivering violins \"delivers a dreary, clich\u00e9-ridden film with all the wallop of a sheaf of crumbling parchment paper.\" London's Time Out contrasted the \"strong material\" in Paul Kember's original play to this melodramatic, \"caramelized\" screen version: \"Gilbert has created a toffee-apple with the apple removed: bite through the sweet crust of romantic Holy Land locations, handsome Israelis, dashing Arab terrorists and corny jokes, and what remains is sheer emptiness.\" TV Guide was equally dismissive, noting, \"the world of an Israeli kibbutz is reduced to a few simple-minded cinematic clich\u00e9s . . . no different from a boarding school or overnight camp. The only really indigenous thing to be found here is the beautifully photographed Israeli scenery, which borders on travelog material rather than background setting.\""

My next album is called 'A Day In The Life Of Sticky Fingaz'. The whole thing is almost like 'Black Trash', like a story where the whole thing connects but each song makes sense and stands alone by itself. The whole thing is one day... It's not even an album... You'll be able to play it or watch it or do both simultaneously as the songs go. It's almost like a hip-hop Broadway play. It will be a new age in music.\u00bb In 2007, in an interview for The A-List Magazine, the director figuratively described the plot of the film as a story in which \u00ab\"The Godfather\" meets \"Romeo and Juliet\"\u00bb. In the same year, in an interview based on fan questions from the Onyx website's forum, Sticky Fingaz called his film \u00abShakespearean rap opera\u00bb.\u00ab... I'm going to sharply change the game. I have a film in which I am a director and I play a main role, it's called \"A Day In The Life\". It's like a Shakespearean rap opera, I still don't know which genre to assign to it. I will be the first person to show my album in cinemas. Now all the music will be visual. Do you know how cinema has less impact without inserted music? This is the opposite. Music is less effective without visuals. I am going to change this situation.\u00bb In 2008, in an interview for the portal RapReviews, Sticky Fingaz referred to the new film as a movie built on rap: \u00abA Day In The Life\u00a0\u2014 basically it's Black Trash, the Kirk Jones album, on steroids. The whole entire movie is a wrap. There are no regular parts in the movie at all, all the dialogue is in rap.\u00bb"

Before he leaves Seattle, he takes his daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) shopping for shoes, but chastises her when she begins acting out for attention. In Arkansas, sheriff's deputy Bill Sherman (Chris Owens) discovers bite-marks on his son's skin after he returns home from the daycare. When his son refuses to discuss what happened, Sherman is convinced of the rumours about Plott. Black arrives in town, and pretends to be a local parent interested in using the daycare. His visit is interrupted by Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is investigating for Plott's defence. However, the two are forced to work together when one boy, Jason Wells, stops breathing. Despite attempts to revive him, the boy dies. Meanwhile, in Seattle, Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) takes Jordan to the dentist after she spits blood while brushing her teeth.  The dentist tells her such an injury is most commonly caused by blunt force trauma. Catherine dismisses the idea outright, but Jordan mentions Black losing his temper during the shopping trip. An autopsy reveals Wells' death was the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious district attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare. Black and Means discover that they have both been sent to investigate by the Group, realizing that this is some kind of test for them. They both come to believe that Barkabow, from whom Black senses a demonic presence, is responsible for Wells' death, and visit her home. Means speaks to Barkabow's mother while Black interviews the child. As they speak, Barkabow begins screaming and accuses Black of harming her; after he leaves the room she hits herself in the face and breaks her jaw.  This leads Roberts, who learns that Black is under suspicion of harming Jordan, to arrest him for assault.  Means has ultraviolet photographs taken of Barkabow's injuries, deduces that the girl was injured with an angel statue from her room. Means realizes that Black could not have wielded this statue, and Barkabow's mother admits to having heard her daughter hit herself. Black is released, and the Seattle investigation against him is dropped when Catherine defends him.  The Black family and Lara return to Seattle, while Barbakow is adopted by a family of the Millennium Group."

Returning to the train, he escapes an angry conductor by ducking into a compartment occupied by attractive blonde Jackie Winthrop (Carole Lynne), with whom Gander flirts. Another passenger, Teddy (Richard Murdoch), has his eye on Jackie as well, but her companion Richard Winthrop (Peter Murray-Hill) ejects both of them from the compartment. When the train stops at Fal Vale Junction, Cornwall, these four get off to change trains, as do Herbert (Stuart Latham) and his fianc\u00e9e Edna (Betty Jardine), spinster Miss Bourne (Kathleen Harrison), and the tippling Dr. Sterling (Morland Graham). However, the stationmaster, Saul Hodgkin (Herbert Lomas) tells them the last Truro-bound train has gone, and that they cannot remain at the station, as he is locking up for the night. The passengers insist on staying, as it is raining heavily and the nearest village is four miles away. Hodgkin warns them the station is haunted. A branch line once crossed the river on a swing bridge close to the station. One night 43 years ago, then stationmaster Ted Holmes had a fatal heart attack while attempting to close the bridge, causing a train to plunge into the river. Ever since, a phantom train has been heard periodically on the abandoned track. It is said to kill anyone who looks upon it. With that, he reluctantly leaves them. As the passengers make themselves as comfortable as they can, they hear footsteps outside. Richard opens the door, and Hodgkin collapses into the room. Dr. Sterling pronounces him dead. Later, a terrified young woman in black (Linden Travers) appears. She, Julia, pleads for help, saying that someone is pursuing her. A car spins off the road and crashes into a tree. The driver is unhurt, but his car is damaged. Back in the waiting room, he introduces himself as John Price (Raymond Huntley) and explains that he is searching for his sister Julia, who he says suffers from delusions. Julia protests that he is lying. Price further explains that she thought she had seen the ghost train, and became obsessed with it ever since. The passengers tell him that Hodgkin has died. When Price insists on seeing the body, they discover it has mysteriously vanished. Price leaves to arrange transportation. Then an approaching train is heard. As it thunders past, Julia smashes a window to look at it, then screams and faints. They hear singing from the nearby railway tunnel mouth. Julia claims that Ben Isaacs (D. J. Williams), the sole survivor of the accident, is coming back. Teddy shoots at the \"ghost\", causing it to flee back into the tunnel, leaving behind a bloodstained cloth. Teddy shows the others the cloth and orders the others, at gunpoint, to stay put until the police arrive, but Richard punches him, knocking him out. The passengers carry him to the bus Price has obtained. When Teddy comes to, he is furious with Richard, as now there will be no one to intercept the train on its return journey. When Gander remarks that he had returned the bridge to the open position, Dr. Sterling suddenly orders the bus driver to stop, while his confederate, Price, produces his own gun. Sterling orders the driver to turn back so they can warn the train. Meanwhile, guns are being loaded aboard the \"ghost train\"; a very much alive Hodgkin flags the train off and climbs aboard. Teddy explains that the train is really being used by Nazi Fifth Columnists to secretly transport arms. While Price heads down the embankment with Julia and the driver to try to stop the train, Teddy knocks Sterling out and gains control of the situation. The train plunges into the river."

The script had to be rewritten to accommodate Askey; the actions of Hulbert's part were divided between the comic star and Richard Murdoch. Filming did not proceed immediately; in January 1941 reports said Carol Reed would direct and Edward Black would produce. Eventually the job of directing went to Walter Forde who had made the earlier sound version. Filming began in February 1941. It was an early role for Carole Lynn who had been discovered dancing on the West End. Shooting took place at the Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, with sets designed by the art director Alex Vetchinsky. Some location shots were also taken around Teignmouth and Dawlish Warren in Devon. ReviewsThe Monthly Film Bulletin  described it as \"a classy thriller:.Sight & Sound called it \"funnier and more ghostly than the original\". In the 21st century, TV Guide.com'' noted the film was \"good for a few laughs and a couple of chilling surprises.\""

The work of the artist's assistant seemed to Burtnyk to be the ideal demonstration vehicle for computer animation and within a year he programmed a \"key frame animation\" package to create animated sequences from key frames.

Untying her, he warns that next time her punishment won't be slow and painful. She runs upstairs screaming: \"I can run faster than you!\" over and over. The next afternoon, Carver's wife Lisbeth questions what he did to Naomi. At lunch Carver tells his mentally retarded half brother Peter that the lamb they're eating is Sophia, for whom Peter has an affection. Naomi cheers him up with her toy horse. Lisbeth takes a tray of food upstairs to her father and reads Edgar Allan Poe's \"From Childhood's Hour\" to him. She alerts him that his guardian angels are in the room, shown to be small creatures with big skulls. Naomi tells Lisbeth she wants to get away to college and meet people and do exciting things. Lisbeth tries to dissuade her, telling about Naomi's grandmother who went to see the circus when Lisbeth was a baby and didn't come back. When Lisbeth was a teenager the circus returned and Lisbeth saw her mother in the circus performing acrobatics. Lisbeth finds an iPod under Naomi's pillow, but allows Naomi to keep it so long as her father doesn't know. The next morning Kimi, L.J., and Jensen arrive, Hollywood producers scouting locations. Carver tears up Kimi's business card telling Uncle Peter to escort them out. Naomi gathers up the card, sneaks a cell phone from a delivery boy, and invites the trio to dinner. Having calmed her father over having guests, everyone settles for the meal when they hear something. The family explains it's \"the protectors\". The Romans buried the dead in catacombs and built the castle above to guard against grave robbers. The \"Skull Heads\" are born of witchcraft to protect the dead from violation. Leaving after a tour of the castle, the film crew are revealed to actually be art thieves. The next morning, preparing to torture Naomi, Carver finds Peter trying to have sex with the maid Claudia. He beats Peter out of the room but has Claudia keep her pants down as he unzips himself. That night, Kimi, L.J. and Jensen sneak in and start stealing items. Jensen finds and releases Naomi from the rack. As they're about to escape, they run into Carver and Lisbeth. Arguing over the right decision for Naomi, Lisbeth explains that Naomi is not only Carver and Lisbeth's daughter, but also their niece as Carver and Lisbeth are brother and sister. Naomi is a little retarded because she is inbred and confused over her identity. Suddenly, Lisbeth and Carver are shot by Kimi, who then forces Jensen and Naomi back into the basement. Kimi has Naomi tie Jensen to the rack for betraying his partner, then presses a button causing the rack to run automatically and locks Naomi in a trap. L.J. and Kimi continue grabbing the valuables they had earmarked. The Skull Heads resurrect the bodies of Carver and Lisbeth as zombies and have them go after the thieves. Carver and Lisbeth corner L.J. and Kimi at the castle doors where they start eating off their faces, spraying blood all over the walls. Peter releases Naomi and Jensen. Jensen follows Naomi upstairs to get her grandfather and is shocked to find he has been dead for quite some time. Suddenly, his body rises up and surprises Jensen, revealing one of the Skull Heads controlling his body. Jensen runs back downstairs, grabs Kimi's gun, shoots at Carver and Lisbeth and runs outside, shutting the doors behind him. Just as he thinks he is safe, a screaming Naomi opens the doors, grabs Jensen and pulls him back in, slamming the doors behind her."

He is selected to attend pilot training school at Naval Air Station Pensacola, where Williams is a flying instructor. When Williams finally recognizes Lefty, he befriends him and takes him under his wing.

Panama rescues Lefty from the burning aircraft, suffering burns to his hands. Lefty is \"washed out\" by his squadron commander, Major Rowell (Alan Roscoe). Lefty is taken to the base hospital, where he falls for Navy nurse Elinor Murray (Lila Lee). When the \"Flying Devils\" squadron is sent to quell bandit attacks by the notorious General Lobo in Nicaragua, Panama arranges for Lefty to accompany him as his mechanic. Panama shows Lefty a photograph of Elinor, the love of his life, not knowing Lefty is in love with her too. When Elinor is sent to Nicaragua, she does not understand the guilt-stricken Lefty's cool reception. When the girl-shy Panama asks Lefty to propose to Elinor on his behalf, Elinor confesses her love for him instead, after which Panama accuses Lefty of betrayal. An urgent call for help by a Marine outpost under bandit attack stops any confrontation. Lefty flies as gunner for Steve Roberts, who makes fun of him about shooting in the right direction. During the mission, their aircraft is shot down in a swamp. Unwilling to join in the rescue, Panama reports in sick, but once Elinor convinces him that Lefty never betrayed him, he flies his own solo rescue mission. At the crash site, Roberts dies of his injuries and is cremated by Lefty using their aircraft as a funeral pyre. Panama finds Lefty but is wounded by bandits led by General Lobo, after his landing. Lefty kills the attacking bandits, takes off, and brings the pair back, putting on an impressive flying display over the base that includes safely landing the aircraft after it loses a wheel. Sometime later, Lefty has won his wings and is now an instructor at the school, married to Elinor. When his wife arrives in their new car, Lefty accidentally pulls away in reverse."

Capra specifically asked for him to star as the laconic pilot and with the acquiescence of studio head Harry Cohn, his role in Flight was emblematic of the studio's reliance on the popular and profitable action film. Receiving full cooperation from the Marine Corps, including the use of facilities and personnel at Naval Base San Diego and NAS North Island, provided the authentic settings Capra required. The initial flying sequence depicts the landing and taxi of an FB-1 fighter, with Holt stepping from the cockpit. { The flight training sequences were staged using Consolidated NY-1B trainers based at San Diego. Nine Marine Corps Curtiss OC-2 aircraft from Marine Attack Squadron 231 (VMA-231) were featured in the aerial combat sequences. The squadron, along with VO-10M (Marine Observation Squadron 10), also prominently appeared in Devil Dogs of the Air (1935). A total of 28 aircraft were at Capra's disposal and with the benefit of using actual aircraft, Capra did not have to rely on \"process shots\" or special effects which was the standard of the day, although dangerous crash scenes and a mass night takeoff were staged using studio miniatures. Along with principal aerial photographer, Elmer Dyer, who filmed from a camera-equipped aircraft, Capra flew alongside in a director's aircraft to coordinate the aerial scenes. Jack Holt who was an accomplished pilot, flew in the film but crashed during one scene. Capra pushed for aerial close-ups and in one scene, wanted Holt to stand up in the cockpit but his parachute had deployed, and he remained seated, causing the scene to be abandoned. Noted Marine Corps exhibition pilots Lts. Bill Williams and Jerry Jerome were also involved in the production."

That night, Griffin holds an engagement party there for his brother Dave, but freaks out when he discovers that Stephanie was invited. Dave suggests Griffin come work with him at his car dealership to get Stephanie back, so Griffin considers doing it. The animals hold a meeting that evening as they feel Griffin is the best zookeeper, so they decide to find some way to help him win back Stephanie. Jerome the brown bear suggests they teach Griffin their mating techniques, but Joe the lion protests, reminding them that it's against the animal code to talk to humans. Donald the monkey suggests that they make Griffin look like a hero when Stephanie is at the zoo tomorrow. The next day, Donald lets Joe out, who confronts Stephanie and Dave's fianc\u00e9e Robin. Griffin ruins the animals' plan by failing to jump into the lion enclosure, and instead the vet Kate, captures Joe. When he climbs out of the enclosure, Joe accidentally yells at Griffin in frustration, causing Griffin to believe he has gone mad. That night, all the animals break the code of silence and tell Griffin they will teach him to win back Stephanie. He learns their different mating rituals, ending up humiliating himself at a party in front of the other zookeepers and the guests. Griffin then has a talk with Bernie, a forlorn Western lowland gorilla who has spent years in a deep enclosure after allegedly attacking a zookeeper named Shane. Bernie tells Griffin that Shane fell when he was abusing him, but lied, saying that Bernie attacked him. This caused Bernie to mistrust humans. Griffin discovers that Stephanie is dating another ex-boyfriend, a bully named Gale. Joe's mate Janet tells Griffin that the best way to attract a female is to be seen with another female, so Griffin asks Kate to go with him to Dave and Robin's wedding. In 2012, Griffin successfully grabs Stephanie's attention by first showing off with Kate, then standing up to Gale. Stephanie asks him out to dinner and after they go to a fashion show. Stephanie convinces Griffin to quit his job and he accepts Dave's job offer. This upsets Kate, and also Bernie, who tells him that Griffin quitting proves that he can't trust humans. As he leaves, Griffin warns Shane not to hurt Bernie. Kate decides to leave the zoo and accepts a job in Nairobi. Griffin becomes a star employee at the car dealership, but finds he misses working at the zoo. When Stephanie proposes to him in the midst of his success, he refuses without hesitation, dumping her as he realizes that she doesn't truly love or accept him as an individual and that their relationship was all conditional to her. He then goes to the zoo, apologizing to Bernie who he sees has been beaten by Shane. The animals tell him that Kate is heading to the airport, so Griffin heads out to stop her; stopping at Shane's house first to attack him for hurting Bernie. Then, with Bernie's help, Griffin manages to catch Kate on the bridge and confess his love for her. The two kiss. Six months later, Griffin and Kate get married and are back at the zoo and Bernie is now living in a new enclosure where he gets a great view of the city."

The local police take her to Coos Bay, where she meets the other patients in the ward: artistic Iris (Lyndsy Fonseca), seductive Sarah (Danielle Panabaker), wild Emily (Mamie Gummer), and child-like Zoey (Laura-Leigh). Kristen is taken to a room previously occupied by their friend, Tammy, and  meets therapist, Dr. Stringer (Jared Harris). She reveals that she is unable to recall anything about her past. She is attacked by a horribly deformed figure that had been staring at her earlier, but upon telling the nurse this, she is drugged and put through intense electroshock therapy. Dr. Stringer uses hypnotherapy to unlock Iris's hidden memories. After the session, Iris is killed by transorbital lobotomy by the deformed figure. Kristen finds Iris' sketch of her attacker with the name 'Alice Hudson', a former patient at the hospital. That night, Kristen and Emily attempt to find Iris and escape. However, Kristen is thwarted by Alice, and loses consciousness while Emily is caught. Sarah is killed by Alice. Kristen discovers that all of the girls had killed Alice together because Alice constantly hurt them. Now she is after the girls for revenge. Kristen tries to talk Emily down from attempting suicide but Alice kills her by slitting her throat with a scalpel. Kristen plans to escape again by holding Zoey as a pretend hostage but is drugged and placed in a straitjacket. She escapes it and she and Zoey try to get out. Zoey is killed by Alice off-screen. After a lengthy chase, Kristen seemingly manages to destroy Alice. She finds Alice's file in Dr. Stringer's office, which has each of the girls' names, including Kristen herself. Dr. Stringer, catching her in his office, reveals that Kristen is actually one of many personalities of the real Alice Hudson, who was kidnapped at age eleven, eight years earlier, and left chained for two months in the basement of the same farmhouse Kristen burned down. In order to survive the trauma, she developed multiple personality disorder, creating each one of the girls from the ward as a different personality. Over time, Alice's own personality became so overwhelmed by the others that she became lost. Dr. Stringer attempted experimental techniques to bring Alice's own personality back, resulting in the manifestation of Ghost Alice, who destroyed the individual personalities one by one. Her treatments were working until 'Kristen' appeared, as an attempt of Alice's mind to protect the other personalities so she wouldn't need to face her trauma. At the end of the movie, Alice packs a suitcase with her belonging as she prepares to leave the hospital. When she opens the medicine cabinet above her sink, Kristen lunges out at her."

She often puts down the other girls through her snobbish and snooty disposition.

While hanging out with his friends at a local fish and chip shop, he meets the beautiful blonde Doris, whose dress and manner show that she is from a higher social class than Tony, his family and friends. Doris' father, a prosperous scrap merchant, originally came from Tony's neighbourhood, but due to his shrewd and sometimes dishonest business skills, he made enough money to move his family to a large, detached house in a nicer area. As a result of her father's money, Doris has nice clothes and her own horse, does not have to work, and attends an expensive school. Doris' father wants her to carry on his upward mobility by socialising with well-off young people and attending university, but due to her family background, Doris is uncomfortable with these expectations. She is instead drawn to Tony and the \"kicks\" they enjoy when spending time together, including riding on Tony's motorcycle and having sex. Doris' father disapproves of Tony, thinking Doris can and should do better, and tries to thwart the relationship. Tony soon falls in love with Doris, and tries to convince her to run away with him, but Doris refuses. Instead, she encourages Tony to commit more burglaries and take her along, even after they are nearly caught in the act. The couple eventually burgle a shoe shop, during which Doris increases the risk on purpose by turning on lights and encouraging Tony to remain in the shop instead of leaving quickly. The police arrive and pursue Doris and Tony, who initially escape, but Tony in his haste leaves behind evidence that is traced to him. He is arrested and sent to borstal, ending his relationship with Doris. Upon being released, he learns that he had made Doris pregnant, and that she married another man before having the child. Doris and her husband were then killed when the motorcycle they were riding crashed. Doris' parents adopted her son. Denied contact with the child he fathered, Tony steals a radio in broad daylight on a busy street and is quickly apprehended. The middle-aged Tony continues his pattern of theft by stealing cheese from his employer. He takes the cheese home to his working-class wife and young sons, with whom he has a loving relationship. Tony is caught with stolen cheese when police wrongly suspect him of a major bank robbery and search his bag. The police inform Tony's manager at the cheese factory, who sacks Tony but declines to press any charges. Tony's wife, although slightly frustrated, is supportive of him, although he does not let her know that he has been thinking of Doris all day. Tony reassures his wife that he can probably get a new job with the butcher."

An article later called 1980 \" a year of national horror and shame\" for the Canandian film industry, other efforts including Middle Aged Crazy and Circle for Two. Reportedly $500,000 came from the CFDC. It was one of five films Coburn made over an 18-month period. \"Something happened between the first script and the final re-write,\" he says of Patman. \"In being made clearer, the film lost a lot of its charm and character. But the idea of a guy who works in a psychiatric ward, ultimately choosing to live in the madness there rather than the madness in the outside world, really appealed to me.\" Kate Nelligan was Canadian, though based in New York where she had achieved great stage success. She agreed to return home to make the movie and help the film be classified as Canadian. Nelligan later called the movie a nightmare, saying in 1983 that \"The Canadian film industry is a joke, and we Canadians should be ashamed of it. We passed a silly law to keep out American film professionals, from whom we might have learned something, and to assure that every incompetent film person in Canada could have a job. What we got were horribly incompetent people in top jobs, drunk most of the time, who went to Hollywood and got completely taken in by every agent in town, and in turn screwed every dentist in Canada out of $5,000 in tax-shelter investments. The boom seems to be over now. It was such a monstrous waste of time and money. I can say all that stuff, of course, because I'm Canadian.\""

The Master tells that it is rumoured that a treasure had been buried at the time. Svetelenz, who is convinced that the treasure is hidden in the house, hopes that if he finds it, he will be able to marry Beate. Young goldsmith journeyman Arno comes to the village to work on the ornamentation of the clock just cast by the Master. Soon, he and Beate fall in love. One night, they see Svetelenz looking for the treasure with a dowsing rod. Beate convinces Arno that he should find the treasure in order to marry her. Arno deducts that a treasure dating from the Ottomans time can only be hidden in the foundations and soon finds the place where it seems to be hidden. Svetelenz tells the Master that he has found the treasure and that they should get rid of the goldsmith who also knows about it. After trying unsuccessfully to burn Arno alive with molten metal, they send him out of the house with Beate to fetch wine while they dig out the treasure. When Arno and Beate come back home, they find the master, his wife and Svetelenz celebrating their discovery. Svetelenz offers his share of the treasure to marry Beate, but she replies that she is not for sale. Arno threatens them with a knife to have his share of the treasure but Beate tells him that he should let them have the gold and she leaves the house. After a moment of hesitation, Arno follows her and they walk away together. The Master and his wife take the treasure to their room and Svetelenz starts digging furiously into the main pillar of the house to see whether there is some gold left. His strikes make the house collapse, burying Svetelenz, the Master and his wife with the treasure under the rubble. Arno and Beate walk out of the forest into the light."

The five act symphony survived because its manuscript  was donated to the Deutsches Filminstitut in 1982, shortly before Deutsch died.  In 2002, DeutschlandRadio Berlin collaborated with the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, conducted by Frank Strobel, to produce a record of \"this extremely rare and totally unknown symphonic work\". The recording became the foundation of a \"synchronized restoration\" of the film.  As film music the \"piece is scored for a theater orchestra of the kind typically found in European cinemas of the day\".  It brings to mind the work of Kurt Weill and Stefan Wolpe, and foreshadows Max Steiner's modernist film scores, adopting expressionist atonal twelve tone leitmotifs.

As a way of adding realism to the effect, every change in the horizontal and vertical viewing directions is accompanied by the hydraulic whine of the traversing gun turret. The film is set during the 1982 Lebanon War. There are four Israeli soldiers inside: the driver in the tank's hull, the loader, the gunner and the commander in the turret. For part of the time there is also the body of a dead Israeli soldier (kept there until it is airlifted away), a Syrian POW, a visiting higher officer, and a visiting Phalangist who threatens the POW with torture and a gruesome death. The soldiers are ordered to clear an area of Lebanese personnel. They are instructed to include the use of phosphorus grenades that are forbidden by international treaty. The gunner has never fired the cannon in a combat situation and is hesitant at first. As a result, a fellow Israeli soldier is killed along with an innocent man in a subsequent incident involving equally poor judgment. The soldiers have to cope with the deteriorating state of the tank, heat, smoke, filth, stench, cramped quarters, equipment failure, navigational problems, conflicting information and recurring quarrels."

Apparently they are fine, they work, get married, have children. But inside the memory will remain stabbed in their soul.\" Maoz, when speaking to The Observer stated that he opposes the Israel-related protest call at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival: \"The point of a film like mine is to open a dialogue, to get people talking to each other about important issues. This is something you can't do if films are boycotted. It makes no sense to boycott art. Maybe I wouldn't have won if Jane Fonda was on the jury, but she wasn't.\" (Note that the open letter at the center of the protest against the spotlighting of Tel Aviv did not call for a boycott of the festival or any of its films.) The Guardian described it as a \"controversial choice\", noting that some commentators in Israel have \"raised concerns that the film will deter young men from volunteering for the army.\" It has also been criticised as a \"shooting and crying\" film. The Golden Lion is the highest award given to an Israeli film to date. Maoz says many Israeli figures were against Lebanon even being featured at the Venice International Film Festival. The Venice jury was chaired by Ang Lee, who had won the Golden Lion award in Venice in 2005 with Brokeback Mountain and in 2007 with Lust, Caution. Lebanon competed against 24 other entries. The win in Venice caused a boost in the film's popularity at the Toronto International Film Festival. The New York Times described Lebanon as \"an astonishing piece of cinema\".  Variety magazine said Lebanon is \"the boldest and best\" of recent Israeli films based upon the Lebanon wars."

Dom is a normal young lad who hangs around with his mates, and one night they go to a nightclub, where his friend Tel walks into Bex. After the two share words, Bex headbutts Tel in the face. The morning after, Tel tells Dom that Bex is after them. The two then go to the local pub, the Lord Nelson, where the firm hangs out. There, Dom apologises for the two of them. Bex compliments Dom's courage, saying that he has a lot of guts to walk in and face him. Dom later finds out where Bex works and goes to visit him. They become acquaintances, visiting a sports shop where Bex purchases a pair of Adidas Munchen trainers. He then asks Dom if he wants to play in his football team. Dom accepts. Dom asks his Dad for money to buy the same pair of trainers. Dom arrives late at the football game and is put in goal. After he saves a vital penalty, the rest of the boys begin to take a liking to him, especially Jay, who asks if he is coming to Portsmouth at the weekend. Dom agrees. Trigger, the firm's second-in-command, visits Bex at work, where he tells him that Millwall's firm and Portsmouth's firm are meeting to discuss the up-and-coming matches between the three teams. Bex walks in on the meeting to pitch his idea of the three firms coming together to form a national firm for the UEFA European Football Championship. The pitch fails, with Millwall and Portsmouth's top boys refusing to stand behind Bex in the national firm unless he and his firm can beat theirs in the upcoming meets. Saturday comes and the firm are at the station getting a train to Portsmouth. When they get there they meet the Portsmouth firm at the pub. Police arrive and try to break up the two teams. During the brawl, Dom is punched in the face but stays on his feet and punches back. Bex visits Dom at work and tells him to not make any plans for the weekend. Dom sees Tel who criticises his tracksuit, but Dom tells him that he is part of the West Ham firm now. Dom later meets Jay, and the two go to the sports shop and steal a load of gear. Some of the firm go to Bex's house to talk about the possible national firm. Bex asks Dom if he would like to go to Europe, and Dom agrees. Bex says he has to get blooded first, which means he has to get the firm's symbol engraved on his forearm. Bex pulls out a Stanley knife and starts to engrave on Dom's arm. When the rest of the firm lick their hands and rub off the symbol that is on their arms he realises that it is a joke. Dom goes to the Lord Nelson to meet up with the boys. Soon after arriving, he is harshly ridiculed in front of everyone by a drunken Trigger for wearing the same tracksuit as Bex. Feeling forlorn, Dom leaves the pub and doesn't go the game. Bex then visits him at work the next day and tells him to stand up for himself, and invites him to a night club. Dom also gets invited to Crystal Palace on the weekend, but the firm end up going to Millwall to launch a surprise attack on the Millwall firm instead. Millwall fights back with weapons and largely outnumbers them. As a result, the surprise attack fails and they suffer a humiliating defeat. Bex, along with Dom and some other members of the West Ham firm, go back later and ambush a Millwall fan as he leaves the pub, beating him half to death with lead pipes. They return home only to find that their cars have been smashed up. A calling card has been placed on Bex's car saying \"Congratulations, you have just met the Yeti\" (the Yeti is a nickname for the Millwall firm leader). Some of the firm express that they are not happy with Bex's reckless leadership in refusing to back down over the feud with the Yeti, and are ultimately forced by Bex to leave the firm. When Bex brings a bag full of blunt weapons to the Lord Nelson in preparation for a revenge attack on the Yeti and his firm, Dom expresses his concerns as well. Bex reacts angrily, bullying and threatening Dom and telling him that he has no choice but to stay with the firm. They go from the Lord Nelson to London Bridge station and ambush the rival firm. Dom looks on as Bex overpowers the Yeti and kicks him savagely in the head and body repeatedly as he lies on the floor. As Bex walks away, the Yeti pulls a flick knife out of his sock and stabs Bex in the stomach. Off-screen, Bex eventually succumbs to the wound. That night, the police are seen arriving at Bex's house. His wife answers the door angrily with the baby in her arms. From the police's silence, she knows Bex has been killed and tearfully goes into denial. In the epilogue, Dom puts on the red tracksuit that Bex told him to never wear again, and heads to the Lord Nelson one last time. He looks through the window and sees that the firm are enjoying themselves and do not appear to be mourning Bex, with Trigger now seemingly in charge. Dom sees this as his chance to get out for good. He walks away from the pub and bumps into Tel. They both walk off exchanging jokes and following their old routine before Dom joined the firm."

        "content": "In the 1890s, young Lady Catherine (Joan Crawford) decides to leave her husband, Lord Clive Cheney (Derek Glynne), and her son Arnold in favor of her lover, \"Hughie\" Porteous (Frank Braidwood). Thirty years later, young Elizabeth Cheney (Eleanor Boardman) is facing the same choice between her husband, the now grown Arnold (Creighton Hale), and her lover, Teddy Luton (Malcolm McGregor). Before going off with Teddy, however, Elizabeth wants to know how the love match between Catherine and Hughie has worked out, so she has invited them to the house while Arnold's now-aged father, Lord Clive (Alec B. Francis), is away on a hunting trip. Scenes of Catherine and Hughie driving toward the house, with only the backs of their heads visible, are intercut. The prim and fussy Arnold is nervous about the impending visit, but when Lord Clive returns to the house unexpectedly just before Catherine (Eugenie Besserer) and Hughie (George Fawcett) arrive, the older man does not seem at all upset by their arrival. The former young lovers have not aged well. Catherine is flighty, trying to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of youth, and Hugh is fat and cranky. Although the two bicker and complain during their visit, Elizabeth sees that they still have a strong bond of affection after thirty years together, and she vows to seek happiness with Teddy instead of the dull safety of marriage with Arnold. Arnold (as well as Clive and the house butler) is aware that Elizabeth may elope with Teddy and seeks his father's advice. Clive cautions his son against acting too impetuously. Encountering Elizabeth, Arnold fails to offer a passionate response to her possible departure from his life. When Elizabeth asks Teddy how he would react if another man tried to take her he away, he says that he would blacken one of her eyes and close the other, which convinces her of Teddy's passion as Arnold watches, unseen by the two. Clive talks with Hughie, believing that he has helped to save Arnold's marriage, unaware that Elizabeth and Teddy have driven away in a chauffeured car. The two try to kiss on the bumpy drive without being watched by the driver, who is wearing a cap and driver's goggles.  When the car seems to break down, the chauffeur reveals himself to be Arnold. He tells Teddy that he will blacken one of his eyes and close the other, and punches his rival. He then forces Elizabeth back in the car and returns to the house. After dinner, Arnold tells Elizabeth that it is time for bed. Outside the bedroom, he loosens his robe and strides in, closing the door. Meanwhile, Clive and Hughie, unaware of all of these developments, simply think that the foolishness of youth has been averted and break down in laughter with each other. This ending is a distinct change from Maugham's play, which ends with Teddy and Elizabeth happily running off together."

        "content": "Following on from the events of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya television series, the story takes place in December. The SOS Brigade, led by Haruhi Suzumiya, makes plans to have a nabe party for Christmas. However, on the morning of December 18, Kyon arrives at school and finds that the nature of his reality has changed; Haruhi and Itsuki Koizumi are missing, Ryoko Asakura has mysteriously returned, Mikuru Asahina does not recognize him and Yuki Nagato is an ordinary human. Only Kyon is aware that everything is different, and no one else remembers Haruhi or the SOS Brigade. Searching the SOS Brigade clubroom, Kyon finds a bookmark left by Yuki before everything was changed, telling him to gather \"keys\" to run a program. Not knowing what the message means, he accepts a dinner invitation from the new Yuki, who reveals a fondness for him owing to the fact that, in this reality, he once helped her get a library card. Asakura prepares dinner for them, and warns Kyon to be mindful of Yuki's feelings. On December 20, Kyon learns from Taniguchi that Haruhi still exists, and simply went to a different high school; Taniguchi knows of her because they went to the same middle school. By revealing his identity to her as 'John Smith', an alias he used when he traveled back in time to assist a young Haruhi, Kyon convinces Haruhi of his story. Excited by the concept of the SOS Brigade, Haruhi assembles the club's members and brings them to the club room. These prove to be the required \"keys\" for Yuki's program. Kyon activates the program, which sends him back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. The adult Mikuru meets with him and takes him to the past Yuki, who says that in the early hours of December 18 Yuki stole Haruhi's powers from her and used them to alter the world such that no paranormal beings or powers exist. She attributes her actions to an accumulation of errors, which Kyon interprets as weariness from having to monitor Haruhi's behavior and protect Kyon. Why Kyon's memories were unaffected by the change is left for the viewer to speculate. Yuki gives Kyon an uninstall program which needs to be shot at her right after the change. Traveling to December 18, they find Yuki. Kyon reflects on his choice to undo the change, reaching the epiphany that he enjoys being with Haruhi Suzumiya and the SOS Brigade and thinks the world is more interesting and fun with paranormal beings in it. He tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who Yuki altered to be her personal bodyguard and perceives Kyon as a threat to her. He is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself, and wakes up on December 21 in a hospital. The world is back to normal, but Kyon has been in a coma since falling down the stairs on December 18. Yuki mentions to Kyon that the Data Integration Thought Entity is considering decommissioning her, since continued accumulation of errors is inevitable and will likely lead to further destructive behavior. Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so aliens would cease to exist. As December 24 comes, Kyon postpones going back in time to save himself from Asakura and joins in on the Christmas party."

        "content": "The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, the fourth volume in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya light novel series, was first planned to be adapted as part of the second season of the anime show. The studio, Kyoto Animation, started production of the new season in June 2007. The production team decided not to worry about the runtime of Disappearance until the script was finished and the storyboards were at an advanced stage, in order to give ample time to all the necessary scenes; they ended up with seven manuscripts for a provisional total of seven episodes. At an unknown point in time, the plans changed to adapt The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya as a film instead. This led to the film being 162 minutes long, the second-longest animated film at the time. Director Tatsuya Ishihara expressed that he wished the film had been a bit longer to adapt even more scenes from the novel, but ultimately was satisfied with the number of scenes they were able to leave in. Directors Tatsuya Ishihara and Yasuhiro Takemoto decided to employ little camera movement to emphasize the atmosphere of the scenes and Kyon's loneliness. Noriko Takao joined the directors in drawing the storyboards at her own request. Both directors expressed that it was helpful to have a woman's point of view during the creation process, which was particularly different in regard to the character Yuki Nagato. The storyboards ended up divided into six parts, A-F, with Ishihara and Takemoto splitting the beginning and end, and Takao doing the C and D parts. They discussed the dialogue extensively to make it sound as true to the characters as possible. Ishihara, Takemoto and Takao said that they spent the most time discussing the depiction of the characters Ryoko Asakura and Itsuki Koizumi. They considered these characters, in the narrative of the film, as people who \"hadn't been chosen.\" In particular, Takemoto asked Koizumi's voice actor, Daisuke Ono, to express the sadness of a sad clown. Takao was the main responsible for illustrating the \"people not chosen\" aspect in the storyboards. Contrarily, they wanted Haruhi Suzumiya's few scenes to create a \"sparkling\" feeling. The studio employed techniques like 3DCG and photography to increase the level of detail in the layouts when the camera panned out far enough that doing it with traditional drawing methods from scratch would be too difficult. Each of the A-F parts of the film had a different animation director that would check the work, which would then go to the director, then to chief animation director Futoshi Nishiya, and lastly to super chief animation director Shoko Ikeda. Nishiya put the most care into addressing the posing, gestures, and facial expressions, while Ikeda's role was to ensure the characters matched their design. For a better result, Ikeda gathered the animation directors at the beginning of the film's production to explain the details of each character design, what to bring out, and what to avoid. She also gave advice on how to avoid an excessive level of realistic detail to allow for more flexibility in the characters' expressions and body postures during the dramatic scenes. Nishiya found it the toughest to work on Kyon due to the wide range of emotions he goes through in the film, whereas Ikeda found it more difficult to work on Nagato Yuki due to the unusually high number of gestures for the character and the delicacy in her emotions. To better convey the emotional development of the protagonist Kyon throughout the film, instead of recording the voice acting for the scenes where all characters are together first, which is the usual method, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was recorded in the order the story develops. Sound director Youta Tsuruoka was highly pleased with the result, praising Kyon's voice actor Tomokazu Sugita for his performance. As for himself, Tsuruoka said that it was a challenge to pack the entire length of the film with the right sounds. The writer of the novel series, Nagaru Tanigawa, gave feedback during the scriptwriting process. Tanigawa also conceived the epilogue exclusive to the film and wrote the lyrics of the ending song. Producer Atsushi It\u014d suggested that the ending song be a cappella."

It was written by Daniel Chun and directed by Greg Daniels. It originally aired on NBC on November 12, 2009. The episode guest stars Andy Buckley as David Wallace, although he only appears via the phone. The series\u2014presented as if it were a real documentary\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, rumors spread that Dunder Mifflin is in serious financial trouble, so Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tries to distract the office by having everyone play a murder mystery game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) uses the game as a way to ask out Erin (Ellie Kemper), but fears he may have asked out Erin's character, instead of Erin herself. \"Murder\" was the first entry in the series written by Chun, and was his first script for the series. The episode also was the inception of two major story arcs, the first being the season-long arc of Dunder Mifflin going out of business and its purchase by the printer company Sabre in the episode of the same name, and the second being the budding romance between Andy and Erin. The episode scored a 4.2/10 rating share in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, and was watched by 8.046 million viewers. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics, with many highlighting its purposeful ridiculousness."

        "content": "In the cold open, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) instructs the members of the office once a year on the various \"changes\" that various martial arts have experienced. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) pranks Dwight by asking him to demonstrate the moves on himself, because Jim reasons Dwight is the most worthy opponent for himself. Dwight ends up punching, blocking, and kicking his own attacks, and ultimately ends up punching himself in the groin, to the amusement of the members of the office. The members of the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in financial trouble. In an attempt to get the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along. The staff slowly warm up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit, and everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate, and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless. Andy decides he needs to make a move on Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) before the day is out, as he may otherwise never see her again due to the possible impending closure of Dunder Mifflin. While in character, he asks Erin out for a weekend date but becomes unsure if he really asked her out or if he just simply asked out her murder mystery character, \"Naughty Nelly.\" He is worried that Erin only agreed because Naughty Nelly is a promiscuous character. Just as the game seems to get interesting, Oscar returns and informs everyone that accounting has been notified to stop payments to vendors. This brings the staff out of the game and back to the reality of losing their jobs. Michael tries to win them back but accidentally skips to the game's conclusion, revealing that Phyllis's character, Beatrix Bourbon, was the murderer. Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out, Michael refuses to give up and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date. Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date. Erin, in character, remarks that Savannah is a long distance away; confused by this, Andy slips up and indicates that the \"date\" was just part of the game. Erin says she was also just playing but appears humiliated as she walks away and later reveals to the camera crew that she thought the date was real. Michael tries to introduce another murder and other twists to the story to pull his staff back into the party. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns the phone calls to Jim and reveals that, while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin is expected to be insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back into the party. Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home, and the others pretend to shoot each other to death."

According to series creator and episode director Greg Daniels, the episode explores the idea that Michael is positively motivated due to his subconscious; although his antics seem nonsensical to many members of the office, in the end, his idea to take his coworkers' minds off of the fiscal trouble proves to be the best choice. This was first explored in the third season episode \"Grief Counseling\". Chun later explained in a Q&A with The Office fansite OfficeTally that \"the episode was partly about Jim realizing that sometimes Michael isn't crazy, he's crazy like a fox\" in that sometimes his underlying motives are clever. Most of the names were based on \"Southern puns\", and it took Chun a while to think of all the names. All of the props, cards, and box were designed by the series' prop department. The producers tried to market the game as a real product, although that never came to fruition. Chun crafted the cold open after being inspired by the second season episode \"The Fight\" because he wanted to see more \"Karate Dwight\". In the original version of the open, the script featured Dwight and Michael kicking each other in the groin. Jennifer Celotta, however, suggested that Dwight fight himself. The episode guest-stars Andy Buckley, who plays David Wallace. Buckley appears only via the telephone, and recorded his lines in the annex of the set, to give the illusion that he was calling from a long ways away. \"Murder\" was directed by Daniels. He particularly enjoyed directing both the cold open, as well as the closing tag, likening both to \"an action film\". In regards to the latter, he referred to it as a sequence that director Quentin Tarantino would have thought up, and noted the importance of having the camera appear in the middle of the Mexican standoff to reveal Fischer. Wilson, Helms, and Carell enjoyed filming the scene, and were particularly exuberant when it came time to fake-kill each other. Several of the scenes, such as when Andy first asks Erin on a date, had to be re-shot so that the cameras were in more discreet places. Daniels later referred to these shots as \"spy shots\". Initially, after Michael announces that \"there has been a murder\", the show was supposed to have cut to a commercial break. However, the producers realized that this was too misleading, as it would have implied that a real homicide had taken place. The Season Six DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael berating and then apologizing to Erin, Michael making a racist remark about slavery while in character, various conference room scenes, and extended sequences of the members of the office playing the game in-character."

Although it was claimed by her in-laws that she died after she had a seizure, examination of the body revealed it to be a case of murder and rape. The police charged three locals with the murder, only to be released by the court which described the prosecution's case as flawed. With no further investigation, the case had, since then, gone cold over the years, eventually acquiring the status of an unsolved mystery. Around 52 years later, Haridas, a detective living in New Delhi, sets out on a journey to Paleri hoping to solve this mystery. Apparently, he was born in the same village on the same night when Manikyam was killed. He is joined by Sarayu, a crime analyst. Most of the clues and knowledge of Balan Nair and Keshavan lead him to zero in on Ahmed Haji, a cruel feudal landlord who lived in Paleri during that period. It was obvious why his name did not figure in police reports from that era; he was so powerful and influential in Paleri at that time. Slowly, as things become clear, Haridas deduces that the murderer is Khalid Ahmed, Haji's first wife's eldest son."

Anxious to get the hit done, Jerry suggests they perform the hit immediately; Tom refuses, and Stanley entertains them with jokes.  As the phone rings, the film shifts to a flashback set ten years earlier, in 1984.  Jerry, a youth employed at Billy's used car dealership, joins Tom as he walks with Karl.  Karl describes how a local gangster bit off the nose of Karl's nephew.  Disturbed by the audaciousness and brutality of the attack, Tom promises to look into the issue.  However, Karl becomes spooked when they enter Tom's car, and Karl begins bargaining with Tom, to Jerry's confusion.  Tom agrees that the two are friends with a long history but strangles Karl after an apology.  Jerry throws up but insists that he is otherwise fine. Tom's next hit involves a trip out of state.  Jerry tags along, and when he becomes surly, Tom allows him to accompany him to the site of the hit itself, a cinema.  There, they meet an unnamed man who becomes annoyed with their loud conversation in which Jerry describes a domestic dispute with his girlfriend, Deb.  The man in the cinema tells them the story about how he and his fianc\u00e9e, Vicki, the star of the low budget action film he is watching, angered the mob.  After hit men assassinate Vicki via a weapons mishap on the set, he goes into hiding and loses his will to live.  Moved by the story, Jerry decides to marry his girlfriend, and the two hit men rise to leave.  Jerry is surprised when Tom slits the throat of the man, and Tom admonishes him to not get so emotionally involved in the stories of their victims. On Jerry's first kill, the two track their victim to a Chinese restaurant.  Nervous, Jerry becomes paranoid and makes a spectacle of himself in front of the victim.  To calm him, Tom describes Ronald Reagan's final acting performance, a cold-blooded hit man in The Killers.  Enthused by the thought of following in Reagan's footsteps, Jerry is able to relax and make his first kill.  Later, as the two wait for their next hit, Tom tells Jerry about their co-worker, Vic, who is rumored to have had an affair with Marilyn Monroe and assassinated John F. Kennedy.  When the target arrives, Jerry asks to make the hit himself, and Tom impatiently watches as Jerry awkwardly attempts to make a clean kill.  After Jerry simply pulls out the pistol and shoots the man head-on, they leave. Tom and Jerry join Vic for a meal, which Vic has prepared himself.  During the conversation, Vic reveals that he intends to publish his memoirs.  After Vic describes a feature film adaptation and talk show appearances that he has planned, the trio argue over the appropriateness of such actions and who should play each of them in a film.  Tom suggests Don Knotts for Jerry, who becomes offended that the others do not take him seriously.  Jerry pulls out a syringe and explains that he is diabetic, only to suddenly stab Vic with it.  Surprised and angered, Tom castigates Jerry for killing Vic in such an undignified manner, as they had previously planned to take Vic out back and shoot him after he finished with his dinner, a death that Tom considered more proper for an assassin of Vic's stature. In their final hit, Jerry panics and accidentally murders an innocent bystander.  He then tells a disturbed Tom of how he occasionally fantasizes about killing his family, eventually admitting that he has pointed a loaded weapon at his infant son's head.  In the present, the phone rings, and Tom reluctantly answers it; he is given the go-ahead and kills Jerry.  After Tom unties Stanley, Stanley reveals that he has been tasked with killing Tom.  The film ends as Stanley asks Tom if he knows any good jokes."

        "content": "Ann Gentry is a social worker wracked with guilt about a severe car accident with serious repercussions for her husband. She is assigned to a new case: the eccentric and mysterious Wadsworth family. She quickly reveals that she has a special interest in the family's youngest member, a seemingly mentally impaired adult man in his 20s who does not have a name and is called only \"Baby.\" Mrs. Wadsworth has been extremely overprotective of him ever since his father left, shortly after his birth; she will not let another caregiver interfere. The family's life revolves around Baby's care and they are dependent upon Baby's disability payments as their main source of income. Ann wants to work with Baby, who still acts and is treated like an infant by his mother and two sisters, thinking that with the proper treatment he might begin to behave more appropriately for his age group. She soon discovers that Baby's infant-like state is not caused by any physical or mental conditions but because of the Wadsworth clan's profound neglect and abuse. Baby is never permitted to speak, walk or do things for himself and is forced to both wear and use diapers. He is punished by being beaten or restrained, and is even shocked with an electric cattle prod whenever he attempts to try to break out of the baby role. Baby has been forced to remain in his state of perpetual dependency and infantilism since his actual infancy. The Wadsworths finally grow tired of Ann's meddling and try to dispose of her during a party, but Ann manages to escape, stealing Baby. Ann keeps Baby in her care at her house rather than turning him over to a professional facility. Eventually, goaded by pictures that Ann sent of Baby doing \"adult\" things such as standing, the Wadsworths break in to Ann's home with murderous intent. They fail to steal Baby back, however, as Ann\u2014with the help of her mother-in-law\u2014kills them all. She stabs Baby's two sisters, then buries Mrs. Wadsworth alive (alongside the corpses of her daughters) beneath the floor of a swimming pool that Ann had been building in her yard. In the end, Ann's interests in obtaining Baby are revealed to have not been as pure-hearted as they seemed. Now that she has him, she no longer wants to rescue or rehabilitate him; she sought him only so he could be a playmate for her husband, who was left with the mental capacity of an infant after his accident. Thus, under Ann's care, Baby will remain trapped in his state of dependency and infancy, but under the kinder care of Ann and her mother-in-law, with Ann's husband as his \"brother.\""

The next day, Javier shows up with motorcycles and says they are for Jay and him to ride. Gloria forces Manny to go to school and has a discussion with Jay that he is now being seduced by Javier's manner just as she was in the past. Jay denies it but waits by the phone for Javier. Meanwhile, Phil (Ty Burrell) is suffering from kidney stones. While suffering from the pain, Luke (Nolan Gould) takes advantage to confess to breaking the glass coffee table which cost the Dunphys their hired help when he blamed it on her (and who was deported as jobless). Phil's dramatics leave Claire (Julie Bowen) no other choice but to call for the firemen to rush him to the hospital. Claire dresses up, wearing a revealing top and tight jeans to look nice much to Phil's dismay. Phil ends up in the hospital to have the stones removed. He plans on taking advantage of the guilt Claire feels for flirting with the firemen but it is short-lived, as she discovers the very attractive patients a couple of rooms down that Phil visited while in the hospital. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) have a harder time than Lily as they attempt to sleep train her. Mitchell discovers Cameron cries all night listening to Lily cry and introduces Lily to Brian De Palma's Scarface. While Mitchell is trying to use the Ferber method of getting an infant to learn to sleep on their own, Cameron keeps running to the room - making Mitchell force him to return to their own bedroom. Mitchell comes home in the afternoon to keep Cameron from indulging Lily. They struggle a bit as Cameron insists on going to Lily's room, and in the ensuing confusion, Mitchell hurts his ankle - when Mitchell suggests they go to the hospital, Cameron starts thinking of the firemen and approves. The episode wraps up with a reference to the opening bit - the kids have been told to act like adults and Alex remarks that if they're to act like the adults in their family, how hard could it be?"

Lonely, Frank creates opportunities to talk to Sarah Ross (Parker), a worker at the General Services Administration's pension office in Kansas City, by tearing up his pension checks and calling to say they have not arrived. One night, an assassination squad raids Frank's house and attempts to kill him but he easily eliminates them all. Knowing they will have tapped his phone, he believes Sarah will be targeted. In Kansas City Sarah refuses to go with him so he kidnaps her. Meanwhile, CIA agent William Cooper (Urban) is assigned by his corrupt boss Cynthia Wilkes (Pidgeon) to hunt down and kill Frank. To find out who is targeting him, Frank tracks down some of his old associates for help. He goes to New Orleans, Louisiana, and visits his CIA mentor Joe Matheson (Freeman), who tells him the same hit squad murdered a New York Times reporter. An agent posing as a police officer tries to abduct Sarah but Frank returns in time. Cooper chases them but Frank tricks the police into arresting Cooper and escapes with Sarah. The two head to New York City and find clues left by the reporter which lead them to a hit list. They find Marvin Boggs (Malkovich), another old associate now excessively paranoid, who tells them that the people on the list, including Frank and Marvin, are connected to a secret 1981 mission in Guatemala. A pilot on the list, Gabriel Singer (Remar), tells them the mission involved extracting a person from a Guatemalan village. Singer is shot by a helicopter-borne machine-gunner and the team escapes as Cooper closes in. Ex-Russian secret agent Ivan Simanov (Cox), in return for a favor, helps Frank infiltrate the CIA headquarters archive. Henry, the records keeper (Borgnine), has much respect for Frank and simply hands him the Guatemala file, as well as informing Frank that Cooper had visited earlier to investigate Frank's past. Frank confronts Cooper in his office and the two fight. Frank is wounded, and Joe arrives to help extract the team. They hide out in the home of former wetwork agent Victoria Winslow (Mirren), who treats Frank's wound and joins the team. The file leads them to Alexander Dunning (Dreyfuss), an arms trafficker. Joe poses as a buyer and enters Dunning's mansion with Frank and Marvin while Victoria and Sarah keep watch outside. They interrogate Dunning, who tells them the target for extraction was Lieutenant Robert Stanton (McMahon), whose US Senator father organized the extraction via Dunning. The younger Stanton is now Vice President and has ordered the assassination of all involved in the mission (other than Dunning) to hide the fact that he massacred village civilians. The FBI surrounds Dunning's mansion. Cooper tries to negotiate Frank's surrender, and Frank tells him about the Vice President's treachery. The terminally ill Joe pretends to be Frank, walks outside, and is killed by an unknown shooter. The confusion, as well as Victoria's cover fire, buys the team time to leave the mansion, extracted by Ivan, but Sarah is captured. Frank calls Cooper from Cooper's own family's home phone and warns him against harming Sarah. The team kidnaps Stanton to trade for Sarah. Dunning arrives at the meeting point. Dunning injures Stanton, revealing himself and Wilkes to be behind the assassinations and that Stanton was never involved. Disgusted with Wilkes' corruption, Cooper pretends to arrest Frank but instead shoots Wilkes. Marvin and Victoria kill Dunning's bodyguards, and Frank kills Dunning by punching him in the throat. Cooper lets Frank's team go as Marvin shoots Dunning to make sure he's dead. Ivan reminds Frank of his favor, in Moldova, for which Sarah eagerly insists on coming along. A few months later, Frank and Marvin are fleeing Moldovan troops with a stolen nuclear device."

The creators of the comic exercised their right to go elsewhere, but this required approval from all divisions of Warner Bros., including television, before it could be approved. After several years, in 2008, Noveck was allowed to take the project to Mark Vahradian at Di Bonaventura Productions. Unusually, this made it the first film from DC not produced by Warner Bros., after the purchase. In June 2008, Summit Entertainment announced plans to adapt Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner's Red. Red was adapted for the big screen by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber, who also wrote the adaptations of Whiteout and Alice. The project was produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura (GI Joe, Transformers). By April 2009, Bruce Willis was reportedly in discussions with Summit to take the starring role of Frank Moses. It was reported in July 2009 that Morgan Freeman was in talks to co-star alongside Willis in the film. Also in July 2009, Robert Schwentke, the director of The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan, was in negotiations to direct Red. In August 2009, Schwentke confirmed to MTV News that he was on board. He stated that he loved the script, but differences existed between the comic and the movie, stating; \"It's very funny, which the comic book isn't ... It's not as violent as the comic book,\" and  \"The script that I've read is obviously different from the comic, because I don't think the comic gives you enough for a two-hour movie.\" In November 2009, Helen Mirren was reported to be engaged to work alongside Freeman and Willis in the film. Also in November 2009, John C. Reilly and Mary-Louise Parker were in negotiations to join the cast. Reilly would play a retired CIA agent who is paranoid that everyone is out to kill him. Parker would play the romantic interest, a federal pension worker who becomes embroiled in the Willis character's struggle to stay alive. In the same month, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss, and Brian Cox entered negotiations to join the cast. In December 2009, creator Warren Ellis stated on his mailing list: \"Read the RED script. Not bad. Not the book, but not bad. Funny. Especially when you know the casting. Very tight piece of work. Talked to the producers last week. They're all kind of giddy over the casting coups. Who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren with a sniper rifle?\" Also in December 2009 Summit Entertainment announced a release date of October 22, 2010. The same month, James Remar was cast in an unspecified role, in addition to Karl Urban as \"Cooper\". In January 2010, reportedly John Malkovich had signed to star opposite Bruce Willis, replacing John C. Reilly, who exited the role in late December. Principal photography began on January 18, 2010, in Toronto, Canada. Red was shot in and around the Toronto metropolitan area for nine weeks before moving on to the road and ending in New Orleans in late March for the final two weeks of principal photography. Filming in the French Quarter of New Orleans commenced in March 2010. Additional photography was shot for a post-credits scene in Louisiana in August 2010."

As Sonia was driving the car, to avoid further complications, Avi insists on them fleeing from the accident scene. But trouble starts for the couple soon after. While strange white marks begin to appear in Avi's photos, Sonia starts having spooky experiences. Avi also develops a severe neck pain and even though he does not appear to be overweight, a scale reveals that he weighs 120 kilograms (264.6 pounds). Avi, too, starts having experiences similar to Sonia's. The couple is petrified when all of Avi's best friends commit suicide in a similar manner. It then comes to light that the spirit haunting them all has a connection to Avi's college life. Meanwhile, Sonia finds out that Avi was friends with a girl named Aarti Kaushik during his college days. As Avi and Sonia are still being haunted by Aarti they go and visit her, but realize that Aarti is dead, having apparently committed suicide by using a knife. Aarti's mother believes that she is still alive, thinking that she is merely ill and will recover. On the way home Aarti continues to haunt Avi and Sonia, and again during the night at the hotel she also haunts Avi in his sleep, ending up with him being thrown off the fire escape. Later Avi is in the hospital and Sonia tells him that Aarti will be cremated, and they visit her funeral before returning to their home town. Sonia finds some photos of Aarti, where she is crawling to get something. As she follows the pattern indicated by Aarti, Sonia discovers that Avi's best friends (who later committed suicide) are raping Aarti. When Sonia talks to Avi about this dark secret, he tells her that he only wanted Aarti to understand his feelings, but that when his best friends tried to talk to her, Aarti hurt Avi's friend Tarun, who became angry and with his friends raped her. Avi claims that when he entered the room he was shocked at the scene and tried to help her, but that Tarun then said that Avi had asked them to rape her as a way of avoiding jail, and accused Avi of planning to do this to her and having one of Avi's friends taking the pictures. Avi then tells Sonia that the reason he kept the photos was to remind him that he failed to protect Aarti and say he is the guilty one. But Sonia leaves him and wishes him that Aarti may forgive him. Later on Avi attempts to kill himself in the same way his best friends did, but as a Polaroid camera clicks towards him, he sees Aarti sitting on his shoulders. Avi is suddenly thrown through the window, and ends up in the hospital, where it is revealed that the reason why she was sitting on his shoulders was that Aarti had still loved Avi. As Sonia makes another photograph of Avi, she speaks to Aarti, asserting that one day she will let go as the reflection in the mirror shows Aarti still leaning on Avi's back."

        "content": "Pig opens with a scene of the black-garbed killer preparing to leave a small house. The individual places several items into a brief case, appearing among them a deck of cards, a notebook, and a copy of the children's novel Mr. Pig and Sonny Too \u2014 an actual publication written in 1977 by the American author Lillian Hoban. The individual closes up his brief case, standing upright and turning to reveal on camera the bleeding, half-naked body of another man lying prostrate on the floor. The living man kicks aside the corpse of the dead one and continues downstairs, placing his belongings into a black car and driving away along a deserted road. The driver continues through the outstretched desert with power lines lining the side of the dirt trail. His vehicle passes an outcrop of rocks with an inscription painted on its face. Although perhaps being unintelligible, it appears to read either as \"ELLE\" or \"ELLIE\". Another sign crops up immediately after, written in black, reading Dead Man\u2019s Point though this is almost unreadable. The film cuts to another individual, the unidentified man (Hollan), masked in white bandages covering his head. He wanders through the desert until reaching a telephone pole and sitting down, cross-legged. The driver's car pulls up to the side of the road, and the masked figure enters on the passenger's side. The two drive down another path and stop at a small house. Upon exiting the vehicle the film continues to a shot of the driver/killer leading the masked figure by a rope which binds his wrists, all the while carrying his brief case. The dilapidated doorway to the house is shown to have the number \"1334\" laid out in small bones at the top, otherwise adorned with dominoes, a crucifix, caution tape, a glove, a knife, and various photographs of someone's arms and head being bound. As the camera zooms onto the door frame, the scene cuts to the victimized masked man's arms being tied with gauze tape, and then finally at the bottom of the doorway a box of dominoes opens up to reveal a keyhole. Through the keyhole a pig mask can be seen sticking through a broken wall. It is revealed that the killer is wearing the mask and pacing about the house. The scene cuts again to a corridor in the house\u2014the word \"Look\" is graffitied along the wall where the masked man is bound at the wrists to a rope connected to the ceiling. The camera spins around the room before showing the two men outside again, this time the masked victim being led by his rope into a cellar. There the victimizer empties his entire brief case, among his things a deck of pornographic cards, a large metal key, a wig, a black die with a chaosphere engraved on one side, a bondage mask, gloves, a chain, a bowie knife and other assorted cutlery, a cleaver, a pair of pliers, papers, at least two pairs of scissors, a plastic funnel with a feeding tube, and (perhaps most importantly) a book entitled Why God Permits Evil, among other items. The captor places his hand on the head of the now once-more bound-to-the-ceiling victim and pulls part of the bandage-mask from his eye, exposing his darting gaze and sense of fear. A collection of pliers, knives, scissors, syringes, and other instruments from the briefcase can be seen below. In the next scene the killer is turning through the pages of Why God Permits Evil, revealing strange, graphic art and religious quotes. The camera then cuts to the victim, his head still gauzed, with the feeding tube in his mouth. The killer pours what appears to be blood through the funnel, into victim's mouth, causing him to gag and choke, spitting it up onto his naked torso."

Linda is unamused with her husband's desire, claiming that finances have killed their loving marriage. Nevertheless, she does as her husband asks, and afterwards feels ashamed about it. Having tired of Fair, she breaks off their affair. Unaware of this, Geoffrey insists she get the latest inside information from Fair, as the stock market is behaving very strangely. Suspicious of Linda's rapid about face, Fair refuses to tell her anything. Not wanting to admit that she was unable to charm her ex-lover, Linda lies to her husband, telling him the market will rise. As a result, Geoffrey loses all of his money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Unwilling to deal with being impoverished, Linda persuades her husband to pay for her extended stay in Bermuda, using some of the money he needs to try to recover. There, she is romanced by Ronnie Sanderson, an Australian sheep rancher. Ronnie proposes that Linda live with him in Australia, but she hesitates to, feeling Australia has nothing to offer her. However, when she learns about her husband having become broke, she is eager to profit from Ronnie in every way possible. Linda is able to manipulate Ronnie into falling for her and he expresses his interest in marrying her if she first returns to New York City to divorce her husband. Once in New York and announcing the divorce, Geoffrey reacts in laughter, telling her she will never marry a sheep rancher. Meanwhile, Linda's maid Celeste steals Linda's jewelry to save her boyfriend Arthur from jail. Linda now realizes she is completely broke and lands a job as a clothing store's clerk. She is surprised by a visit from Ronnie, who insists on taking her to Australia immediately. Geoffrey, who is not willing to let go his wife, warns Ronnie about Linda's spoiled character, but Ronnie does not feel threatened. On the evening Linda is leaving, Geoffrey confronts Fair with losing all of his money because of Fair's supposed statement to Linda. They initially quarrel, but in the end, Geoffrey receives some of the money he lost as a loan. Back home, he receives a visit from Linda, who has come to say goodbye. They realize the faults they have made in the past and are reconciled. Linda tears up Fair's check."

Released in 1989, in black and white, the film depicts the impoverished life of two brothers, Vicente and Nino, after their father dies. With the help of Clara, Vicente's childhood friend, the trio struggle to survive, caught between their uncle's attempt to abduct/adopt Nino, and mobsters looking to collect the debts Vincente's father left behind. The film was selected as the Portuguese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. The film clearly demonstrates Costa's cinephilic knowledge, as it recalls many scenes, sensations, and styles from classic filmmakers. Despite such references, this is not intended as mere quotation, because in the process Costa engraves his own vision. Adrian Martin writes \"...the poetics of certain filmmakers have been so deeply internalised, we might say say so deeply lived (in the imaginary realm) by Costa, that a unique palimpsest has been formed at the intersection of all these visions, all these worlds, all these memories: his signature is that knotted thicket, too tangled, fused and transformed to ever be cleanly separated, now, into its various separate source elements.\""

The lives of the two men are explored and challenge viewers' ideas about jihad, loyalty and al-Qaeda.  The filmmaker, Laura Poitras, inter-cuts Hamdan's trial (his military lawyer challenges the tribunals as unconstitutional and takes Hamdan's case to the US Supreme Court) with Jandal's contradictory conversations with his son and Muslim pupils, and during media interviews."

He was released but continued to appeal his conviction. It was upheld in 2011 by the Court of Military Commission Review and appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 17, 2012, the Court vacated Hamdan's conviction. It ruled that the acts he was charged with under the MCA were not war crimes by international law at the time he committed them.

        "content": "Deep Throat in Tokyo was part of a fad during the mid-1970s of taking foreign sex films as inspiration for domestic releases. Nikkatsu's Tokyo Emmanuelle (1975) and Lady Chatterley In Tokyo (1977) were part of this trend, the former film starring Deep Throat in Tokyo'''s Kumi Taguchi. In his Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema (1998), Jasper Sharp compares Deep Throat in Tokyo to its US inspiration, Deep Throat (1972). According to Sharp, Mukai's film has much better production values, taking an \"airbrushed fantasy\" approach more similar to the French Emmanuelle'' (1974) than the \"crude and direct\" US film. Nevertheless, Mukai's film presents a reactionary attitude towards sex in direct opposition to the liberated approach attempted in the US film. While the US film portrayed sex as something to be enjoyed by both men and women, in Mukai's film, it is for the man to enjoy at the woman's expense. In contrast to the humorous approach taken by the US film, Mukai's plays its subject seriously, which, Sharp notes, enables it to be enjoyed in a camp manner. As an example of this aspect of the film, Sharp singles out a scene soon after Kumi's operation, in which she first experiences post-surgery orgasm by shoving a banana down her throat. Red wine flows down Kumi's throat signifying the loss of her \"virginity\", as the orchestral soundtrack swells for dramatic emphasis."

However, when Jo opens up the floor to suggestions on how to improve business, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) offers an idea on how to improve shipping for both paper and printers. As a result, Jo allows Darryl to take Jim's old office. Michael tries once again to earn Jo's favor with some small talk and by scheduling a vacation to her home state of Florida, but Jo berates him for wasting time, and Michael cancels his flights. The rest of the office gets frustrated when Jo forces them to stay late, as she has an unpredictable work schedule. Michael is particularly upset, as he made plans to meet Todd Packer (David Koechner) at a bar for St. Patrick's Day. The employees try to make multiple breaks for it, but fail. Michael is finally direct with Jo, and tells her he's allowing his employees to leave. She complies, showing the first hint of respect for Michael. Michael and Todd Packer meet the rest of the employees at the bar. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are set to have their first date. However, Erin is sick and Jo sends her home. Andy, wanting to see Erin, feigns being sick so he can leave too. He visits Erin at home, and they watch TV together. However, their time is interrupted when he meets her foster brother (Sean Davis), who makes Andy sit on the chair while he sits next to Erin on the couch. Erin and her foster brother engage in physically intimate behavior, so Andy begins to suspect that the foster siblings are romantically involved. When he prepares to leave, however, Erin gives Andy a lingering kiss on the cheek. While Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) are gone on parental leave, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) arranges Jim's and Pam's desks with his into one \"Megadesk\". When he returns from leave, Jim puts the desks back properly, but Dwight continually reforms his \"Megadesk\" whenever Jim isn't around. In a bid to preserve \"Megadesk\", he tells Jim about how he and his cousin Mose never saw their fathers when they were young. He then plays an obnoxious rendition of \"Cat's in the Cradle\" on the computer while Jim is on a sales call. Jim (surprised that Dwight's cheap manipulations are working) wishes he was at home with his newborn daughter. Dwight attempts to get out of work by telling Jo he has a meeting with a client, but Jim beats him to it. This allows Jim to leave, forcing Dwight to go back to his desk. At the end of the episode, Dwight comes in to work the next day to find that Jim had rearranged the desks into a \"Quad-Desk\"; one desk on top of the other two desks, with a little space in between the two bottom desks where he put Dwight's computer, phone and nameplate."

Yamatoya had co-directed the pink film  with K\u014dji Wakamatsu in 1966, but Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands was his solo feature film directorial debut. He directed a few more pink films such as  for Wakamatsu's production company, but found writing to be more to his taste. He often wrote anonymously for Wakamatsu during the 1960s, and was later regularly credited for his script work at Nikkatsu on their Roman porno series. He revisited the sex-doll theme in his script to Ch\u016bsei Sone's Roman porno Love Doll Report: An Adult Toy (1975). Sone was one of Yamatoya's co-workers on Branded to Kill, and Yamatoya wrote several of Sone's Roman porno scripts, notably Showa Woman: Naked Rashomon, an erotic restructuring of Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950). Yukihiro Sawada, who worked with Yamatoya on the script for Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands, also went on to work at Nikkatsu, where he directed such Roman porno'''s as Sex Hunter: Wet Target (1972). During the filming of Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands, lead actors Noriko Tatsumi and Y\u016bichi Minato worked together on director Ario Takeda's pink film Love's Milky Drops for Okura Eiga studio.

        "content": "Critics call it one of the first films depicting corruption in public life and the futile struggle against it. The film also throws light on the unholy nexus between politicians and media whilst focusing on the impact of drug abuse and addiction. Contrary to stereotypes of Indian cinema which include romantic interests, intense background music and songs which are generally accompanied by dance sequences. the movie takes a neo-noir approach towards investigative journalism which forms the bulk of the movie. This can be considered one of the earliest approaches towards a paradigm shift in film making in India which unfortunately didn't take off until the early 2000s due to the tragic death of Shankar Nag in 1990. Ilayaraja's score is sombre which plays an important role in the film attuning to the grim nature of grief suffered by the lone survivor of the Accident. Background noise such as clanking of typewriter keys, camera clicks, car screeches, white television noise, bullets sliding inside a pistol, etc. form the bulk of the spacing in the movie. The silence at the scene of the accident scene is haunting. There are no songs in this movie, which provides it a far more serious pacing in comparison to the casual overtones found in most Kannada movies. Distinction amongst different classes in society is well represented in the movie and the disdain powerful politicians have towards ordinary working-class people whilst not campaigning for an election is wonderfully portrayed."

        "content": "The episode was written by producer Eric Buchman, while filmmaker Michael Grossman directed it. Buchman explained how his main concept for the episode was to describe O'Malley's grieving in a different way than depicted for Stevens, but in a manner that would be both bothering to her and painful for his partner, Torres. However, he stated that Torres' emotional state during the mourning was also significant to the episode: \"We wanted Callie to feel some remorse. She finally got George, but not in the way she wanted. She's gotten his body, but the underlying relationship isn't there anymore.\" Buchman disclosed that one of the story lines he had originally intended to include in the scrip was Yang and Burke's cold relationship being \"kept alive\" by having silent sex, which ultimately did not occur, due to being looked upon as \"boring, neither dramatic, nor comedic\", and also as not being descriptive of the character's feelings. The story line involving the four attending physicians fighting for the title of chief of surgery, was described by Buchman as a comic relief, used to emphasize a childish side of the characters' personalities which had not been previously developed. In addition, Buchman described Webber's retirement as an attempt to reconcile with his estranged wife, but leads to emotional devastation at the realization that she had moved on with a different man. The concept of Grey and Shepherd's fight was described by Buchman as having \"no more taboos\", compared to the other story lines developed in the episode: \"Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone she feels a genuine connection with. We might know Derek will come back, but she doesn't.\" The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed \"a milestone of sorts for Meredith\", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: \"What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems like such a waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, the last thing we wanted to see them do is pour water on their fire\", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be \"frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected\" for the audience."

B.O. takes a shower with O-Bouy soap (a parody of Lifebuoy soap, complete with its jingle) and overly douses himself with expiring perfume. Then he goes out for a walk. The flowers along the path from his home wither and fall as he passes them. As B.O. walks to the forest, he sees a pretty squirrel who calls him closer. But as B.O. goes to the squirrel with wilted flowers and she smells his stench, she runs out to her home and puts up a sign that reads \"NO VACANCY\". The point is that B.O. has an offensive odor from which everyone runs. B.O. then sees a pretty female rabbit. He first gives her a flower to smell, and then substitutes himself. The female rabbit screams in horror and runs into her hole and \"zips\" it. B.O. cries, not knowing what to do. Then, Cupid appears and gives the skunk a book: \"Advice to the Love-Lorn\" by Beatrice Bare Fax (a reference to famed newspaper advice columnist Beatrice Fairfax). The first chapter says to try the great lover routine. B.O. then goes to another female squirrel sitting on a branch and attracts her by speaking in the manner of Charles Boyer. All goes well until the squirrel smells B.O. and runs away. B.O., thinking he is kissing the squirrel, kisses the branches of the tree and then a sleepy owl. The owl falls onto the ground, unconscious. The second chapter says to try the balcony routine. B.O. dresses like Romeo and climbs a tree to serenade a female raccoon with a part of the sextet, \"Chi mi frena in tal momento\" from Act II of Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. At first, the raccoon is attracted to B.O.'s wooing, but when she smells him, she throws a pot at him, sending B.O. falling into a nearby pond. Even the fish are repelled by B.O.'s smell and then they run away from the pond. Then, a big female rabbit goes to B.O., grabs him and wants to kiss him. But even she runs from his smell and tosses B.O. into a trash can and hides herself in a rabbit hole, which moves as she flees. The next chapter of book says \"Swoon 'em!\" B.O. then gets a Frank Sinatra suit and pours water on it to become thinner. Then, B.O.-Sinatra sings \"Rhapsody in Pew\" (really All or Nothing at All, sung by Bill Roberts). All the females in the forest run to hear B.O.'s singing. All of them swoon, and even an old female rabbit jumps in the air and yells \"FRANKIE!\" B.O. continues to sing with more gags and then ends as all the females jump on him. But then they all run out, having detected his smell. Despairing, B.O. then attempts suicide by drinking a bottle of poison because no one loves him. But Cupid stops him and shows the last piece of advice: camouflage! B.O. then sees a pretty fox and disguises himself as a male fox. B.O. whistles to the fox. The fox likes B.O. and she kisses him. B.O. is excited and then walks with the fox on a trunk lying horizontally above the river. B.O. and the fox then lose their balance and fall into the river. Downcast, B.O. thinks that now the fox will run away from him, as the paint has washed out. But the \"fox\" is really a painted skunk too, as is revealed when paint washes out of her fur. Now aware that they are both skunks, they kiss longingly. Iris out, and B.O. throws the advice book out of the scene."

However, the course of events that follows Kishan's attempts to expose and reform Raj in order to help Sanjana, who he is apparently in love with, takes twists and turns that are hard for him to deal with, and what follows suit forms the rest of the story.

        "content": "Raj Malhotra, Vikram Chopra and Yogi Mathur are best friends and business partners who are married to Sanjana, Shivani  and Maya respectively, and live in Vancouver, Canada. The three of them constantly cheat on their wives with not one or two but many women. However, while Yogi is the only unsuccessful one due to Maya having a secret friend spying on him, Raj and Vikram are able to get away with their flirtatious behaviour by fooling their wives and keeping them under check. One day, when the three wives, who are also friends, meet up, and Maya brings up Sanjana's issue about a free necklace due on Raj when the two met previously that day in a mall, she and Shivani insist on Sanjana having a detective, Kishan Khurana, in reality Maya's \"friend\", solve the problem. However, when Maya arranges a meeting between them, things don't seem to work out because Sanjana happens to rubbish away Kishan's accusations against Raj. This compels Kishan to try exposing Raj by calling all his girlfriends to the New Year's Eve party, but Kishan's plan goes haywire when Vikram steps in and saves Raj. Confused to the next day, Raj and Vikram suspect a spy being part of the scandal that was about to occur last night and seek help from friend and Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent KD, who instead suggests hiring a private detective as the matter is too trivial and unprofessional for an intelligence agency to handle. However, as fate would have it, they land up at Kishan's place, and, having recognized him from the party, enlist his help. Kishan, who is apparently crushing on Sanjana, decides to engage Raj and Vikram in a double game, which results in the duo mistakenly assuming Yogi as the informer after Kishan shows them a doctored video of Yogi conversing with Sanjana, and ceasing their friendship with him by exposing him on one of his cheat dates. Later that day, he creates a fracas for Raj by nearly exposing him as a cheater when he is caught in a bathing robe, but Vikram again comes up with an idea, this time about having Raj pose as an undercover cop in the CSIS, who was unintentionally exposed during a \"mission\" for KD, who played his boss, and was responsible for killing dreaded don King's brother. Sanjana believes the story and forgives Raj, later snubbing Kishan over the expos\u00e9. Realizing that something is wrong with the deal, Kishan learns from Yogi about the plan and decides to expose them by staging himself as King and having them assemble blindfolded, with Sanjana and Shivani in attendance. When the truth is out, Sanjana tries to commit suicide, but Kishan convinces her otherwise, and comes up with a plan to reform Raj and bring his loving former self back to her life, part of which is a plan to entice Raj into jealousy by having Yogi inform him and Vikram of Sanjana beginning an affair and relationship with a dynamic, handsome man, who would be none other than Kishan himself. Eventually, Kishan's plan of the jealousy game works out well, but trouble brews big time when Shivani, through Kishan's help, has Vikram thrown out of the house upon having obtained ownership of all his property by getting him to unsuspectingly sign \"bank account\" papers during the time he was advising a troubled Raj, who made a witness. Helpless and destroyed, the three men turn to Kishan for help again, where they request him to blow the covers of their enemies, and vow to batter their fugitives to death, little knowing that they instead have a common enemy in Kishan, who throws a subtle suggestion about the same which they fail to recognize, and while Sanjana is to keep a fast for Raj, Kishan comes up with his own plan and lures the trio to King's house after they end up with his jacket. Kishan then arranges the trio to meet King's wife Maddy, who too is doubting King's possible affair, but the meeting turns out a disaster when they learn that King is innocent and Maddy starts shooting at King left, right and center for flirting with another girl. While waiting for him at his office to discuss details of the meeting, Raj and Vikram, along with Yogi, finally figure out in a sudden fit of musical epiphany that Kishan was in on the scam, double-crossing the three men while playing for their wives, posing as Sanjana's boyfriend, Shivani's \"brother\", and Maya's \"friend\", having lured them to King's lair out of intent. Sanjana disrupts a fight about to break between the four after Kishan arrives to find himself exposed. Assuming her to be openly in league and love with Kishan, Raj demands a divorce from Sanjana, and a shocked Kishan, in the next few days, manages to convince a crying Sanjana for marriage. However, while trying to invite the trio, Kishan is mistaken as the groom-to-be, and they, drunk, are arrested for smashing a police officer's head. While in the cell, Raj rues about Sanjana and contemplates deceiving her, when he, Vikram and Yogi are bailed out by an injured King. Raj is in fury and decides to kill Kishan, for which King has his henchman Benny give him a gun. Raj succeeds, but when Sanjana confronts him, it turns out that the assembly of people was for the couple's remarriage. However, Kishan reveals himself to be alive, giving the wives relief, with King and Maddy showing up, as Kishan had arranged for their bail. Seeing his dedication, the wives, and Sanjana's mother and sister, ask Kishan about his reason for helping Sanjana way too personally, something which is unexpected of a professional of his kind. Kishan then reveals that his wife Divya once walked in on him cheating on her and killed herself by slitting her wrist. Feeling guilty and breaking down, he set off on a mission to help aggrieved ladies of his wife's kind in order to redeem himself. However, it was with Sanjana that he saw a reflection of his wife in her, and decided to help her. Finally, the three couples reunite, while Kishan leaves Vancouver for his next mission."

Henry is a middle-schooler, and deals with bullies after school, forcing him to eventually take refuge in the Baptist Church where Henry meets Pastor John (Ruben Studdard). Pastor John takes a liking to Henry when they begin to play worship music on the church's piano, and discovers Henry is a very talented singer. Pastor John gives Henry a flyer for the Alabama Teen Star Quest, a singing competition in Birmingham. William's Reserve unit is activated and deployed to Afghanistan. While William is gone, Henry sends him songs to listen to, and to show off to his Marine buddies. While William is gone, Henry's mom cannot afford the mortgage on the house, and they move into Lisa's dad's trailer, without telling William. Lisa's dad hates the music Henry listens to and didn't agree with her marrying William. Henry skips school, but Lisa thinks he is gone. She begins to bike to her therapy session, but turns around. She walks to the neighbors and gets high, breaking her promise to William that she'd stay sober. Henry watches his mom get high out of the window, and unplugs his headphones from his radio. Lisa's dad returns and hits Henry for listening to his music and skipping school. He decides to leave and attend the competition. He tells his mom \"bye,\" but she is too high to understand. Henry hitchhikes to Birmingham to enter the singing competition.

Henry gets far in the competition, and is covered on the news, where Lisa's dad sees him. Lisa and her dad go to Birmingham and find Henry. Lisa's father tells the competition officials that he hasn't had a parent with him the entire time. This confuses Henry, who is told his father died three months earlier. Henry looks at his dad, who says no one else can see him. His dad was killed by an Afghan woman back when he was deployed, but William's spirit was with Henry the whole time. Henry decides to drop out of the competition because his dad isn't there. William's spirit then visits his friend for his unit. The friend's remote breaks on the channel talking about Henry and reads a letter William gave him. The letter tells him to help Henry in the competition if he ever dies. Back at the competition Henry can't sing because his dad is gone. The judges eliminate him but one of the other singers quits and let Henry have his place. Together Henry and William's friend win the competition and are offered a chance to meet with a record company in Los Angeles."

Phil takes Claire to an adults-only pool, abandoning their kids with Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet).

Before the riot happened, a wildlife photographer named Madhu Kumar witnessed a group of criminals transporting explosives through the local forest check post, so he calls up the local police commissioner Shankar and passes on the information. However, the goons managed to capture and murder Madhu to cover their tracks. While helping the police to fight against the rioters, the aggressive yet honorable District Collector Thevalliparambil Joseph Alex IAS is suspicious of Shankar's activities and decides to investigate the case with the help from his subordinates ASP Prasad IPS and Assistant Collector Anura Mukherji IAS who admire Joseph for his honesty and aggressive behaviour against corrupt officials and politicians. Joseph is brought over to a personal hearing with the state minister John Varghese, who berates him over his behavior while attempting to stop the riots. However, Joseph stands up by reprimanding Varghese for his belief in using his authority to belittle and harass others. Meanwhile, Madhu's father reaches out to Prasad after filing a case regarding to Madhu's disappearance, resulting Prasad to finally discover Madhu's corpse with his camera, though the film is missing. As the investigation heats up, the Member of Parliament Jayakrishnan is assisting in relief works in the damaged area by meeting the aggrieved entities after his arrival from Delhi. However, it turns out that Jayakrishnan is the mastermind behind the massacre as he planned the riot against the slums to plan a new real estate business in the area. Also involved in the conspiracy are Varghese, Ibrahim Jalal and Shankar, as the latter sent up the goons to murder Madhu to cover their tracks. The local police medical surgeon Dr. Vijay, who has conducted the autopsy on Madhu's body, deduces that Madhu was murdered, but he ends up dying in a road accident. Eventually, Joseph finds a new ally named Sanjay, who happens to be Vijay's younger brother and a close buddy of Joseph during his Mussourie training days. Joseph, along with Sanjay and Prasad, finds out that Dr. Vijay was injected with a powerful drug by the same goons who murdered Madhu, which could have contributed to the accident. While Jayakrishnan flies back to Delhi to accept his new job as a cabinet minister in the central government, Joseph arrests and interrogates Jalal, who reveals that the lead goon Ananthashankara Iyer is responsible for murdering Madhu and Dr. Vijay. After arresting Iyer at a shopping mall, Joseph uses the same sedative to force Iyer into giving out important information about the conspiracy behind the communal riot. However, before Joseph and Prasad could escort Iyer to the police station, Iyer's boss Vikram Khorpade, a Mumbai underworld don who has strong ties with Jayakrishnan and being a major player in the conspiracy, arrives and causes a shootout that allowed him to rescue Iyer. Vikram also takes the opportunity to murder Anura before fleeing away with Iyer, much to Joseph's shock. Declaring this personal, Joseph, Prasad, and Sanjay track down Vikram and his goons to a horse farm, where they kill all of the goons residing there. After Sanjay kills Iyer by hanging him on a chain, Joseph beats up Vikram before taking him into custody, forcing him to reveal the identities of the people behind the conspiracy. Following his return after being sworn as the new cabinet minister, Jayakrishnan is met by an angry Joseph and several officers. Joseph takes the opportunity to expose Jayakrishnan's conspiracy plot to the public, using both Iyer and Vikram's confessions as proof of his findings. As a result, Jayakrishnan is placed under arrest for conspiracy to crime and murder while Shankar is suspended and arrested by his own officers for the same charges. However, Jayakrishnan refuses to concede defeat and instead takes one of the officers' guns before firing at the crowd, murdering Vikram and several citizens in the process. Jayakrishnan uses the commotion to make a getaway in a car, only for Joseph to shoot the gas tank, causing the car to explode and kill Jayakrishnan for good. Joseph is then hailed as a hero by the public for his actions."

For example, they put an inflatable swimming pool on it and the son and his friends use the highway to ride their bicycles. As it has been ten years since the highway was abandoned, they believe that it will not be completed. One day, without warning, construction workers begin to upgrade the road and the highway opens to traffic. Despite noise from passing traffic, the family remains in the house. Previously, the father would simply walk across the highway in order to access his car to get to work. This becomes harder as the highway becomes busier. He and his children eventually have to use a tunnel in order to access the outside world. Their younger daughter, Marion (Madeleine Budd), becomes obsessed about the quality and cleanliness of her surroundings. She monitors the grass as it exhibits the effects of carbon monoxide emissions and is convinced that the family may fall ill or even die prematurely, as a consequence of living in such close proximity to the highway. The elder daughter, Judith (Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Leroux), continues to sunbathe on the front lawn, despite attracting unwanted attention from passing motorists. One day, Judith decides to leave home without telling her family. Returning after a period of time, being driven by a man, she finds the house bricked-up and, after an unsuccessful attempt to find an entrance, leaves again. In her absence, Michel had attempted to leave with the remaining children, but Marthe refused to depart. The family then decided to sound-proof the house, which included blocking up all the windows and sealing all the ventilation points. Confined, the pressure begins to take its toll and, in what appears to be a death dream, Marthe breaks open a wall and the family exits the house into the sunlit outdoors."

        "content": "As nuclear explosions ravage New York City, residents of an apartment block rush downstairs to escape from the building, only to be forced into the basement by further explosions. Only eight of the residents \u2013 Eva and her boyfriend Sam, Josh and his brother Adrien, Josh's friend Bobby, Marilyn and her daughter Wendi, and Delvin \u2013 manage to force their way into the building's bomb shelter before the superintendent, Mickey, seals the door. The group acclimates to the cramped surroundings while Mickey asserts his dominance over the shelter and its denizens, much to the chagrin of Josh, Bobby, and Delvin. After some time, the shelter's door is broken open and the shelter is invaded by armed soldiers in biohazard suits; the men's speech is unintelligible and their allegiance remains ambiguous. The men attack the group and seize Wendi, leaving the shelter with her. Delvin and Mickey manage to kill three of the men and Mickey takes a rifle. Josh volunteers to use one of the dead soldiers' suits to leave the shelter and search for Wendi. Outside of the shelter, Josh finds the area entirely sealed off by plastic sheet tunnels connected to a laboratory. Josh's outfit allows him to explore the lab, where he discovers several unconscious children, including Wendi, in stasis units, their hair shaved off and their eyes bandaged. One of the soldiers checks the ID on Josh's suit and, realizing he is an imposter, tears out his breathing apparatus, exposing Josh to the air. Josh flees back to the shelter, killing two of the soldiers on the way. After Josh returns, the soldiers weld the door shut from the outside, trapping everyone within. Time passes; Josh begins to suffer the effects of the radiation and admits to Adrien that he only went outside to find rescue for Adrien and himself. Eva, in a fractured relationship with the meek Sam, grows closer to Adrien. Bobby volunteers to hack up the bodies of the dead soldiers so their decaying remains can be thrown into the toilet's septic tank. Delvin grows suspicious that Mickey is hoarding resources. Marilyn, having been told by Josh that Wendi is dead, enters into a sexual relationship with Bobby. Marilyn attempts to convince Eva to sleep with Josh, warning her that the men will want sex. The group grows increasingly angry with Mickey as resources grow scarce, culminating when Delvin discovers Mickey's locked safe room and threatens to taser him if he does not open it. A struggle ensues and Mickey shoots Delvin in the head with the rifle. The group does not believe Mickey's argument of self-defense, and an increasingly ill Josh, and an increasingly deranged Bobby, torture him to gain the code to the safe room. Eva throws the rifle down the toilet to stop Josh using it. Seizing authority, Josh and Bobby are physically and emotionally abusive of Marilyn. Josh makes it clear that he wants Eva, and Sam is unable to stand up for her. Eva and Sam try to protect Marilyn from Josh and Bobby, but are unable to. While Eva is tasked with watching Mickey, Mickey reveals that there is a gun hidden in his safe room. Josh and Bobby force Eva to hack up Delvin's corpse when Sam cannot, leaving Eva distraught. Josh and Bobby, both losing their hair to radiation sickness, shave their heads. Mickey informs Eva that there is another way out of the shelter, through the septic tank to the sewer. Eva tries to retrieve the gun, but cannot get past the pair. She finds Marilyn's corpse, the two having beaten her to death. Eva notices her hair is falling out and realizes she is also sick; the shelter is not protecting them from the outside because of the broken door. Eva sends Sam to retrieve the gun while she cuts the power to distract Bobby and lures Josh away with the promise of sex. Josh grows suspicious and tries to rape Eva, but she fights him off with help from Adrien. Sam retrieves the gun, but as Bobby, Josh, Eva, and Adrien yell instructions at him to give the gun to them, Sam shoots and kills Adrien, perhaps as a result of jealousy over Eva's affections for Adrien. Josh brutally beats Sam. Bobby turns on Josh and is about to shoot him when Eva cuts his throat with a tin can lid. Eva frees Mickey, who shoots Josh. On his last action, Josh smashes an oil lamp, setting himself alight and causing a fire in the shelter. While Sam and Mickey attempt to put out the blaze, Eva chooses to escape. Eva recovers the biohazard suit and locks herself into the safe room, leaving Mickey and Sam trapped inside the burning shelter. Breaking through the toilet into the septic tank below, Eva drops into the tank and finds a ladder to the street. She emerges into the remains of the city and stares blankly at the total devastation."

It introduces the men and women involved with the Dillon Panthers, a Texas high school football team. In the pilot episode, the team is preparing for the first game of the season, which will be the first game under new head coach Eric Taylor. The show is based on the 2004 film Friday Night Lights, which was in turn based on the 1990 non-fiction book Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream by H. G. Bissinger. Peter Berg, who is Bissinger's cousin and who directed the film, wrote and directed the pilot episode, and served as executive producer for the series. While some of the actors from the movie returned to act on the show, most of the actors were cast specifically for the television series. Critical reception of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show would be able to stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34."

        "content": "It is Monday morning, and five days until the first game of the season for high school football team Dillon Panthers. While coach Eric Taylor is surveying the field, some of the players are getting ready for practice. Fullback Tim Riggins is recovering from a hangover, and his brother Billy warns him that he could be kicked off the team if he does not show. Meanwhile, second-string quarterback Matt Saracen is preparing lunch for his grandmother, before his friend Landry Clarke drives him to practice. At the stadium, a television crew is conducting interviews. It is revealed that coach Taylor, who has recently been made head coach, used to coach the exceptionally gifted quarterback Jason Street. It also becomes clear that there is a deep-seated conflict between Tim Riggins and the brash and loud-mouthed running back Brian \"Smash\" Williams. Later, at the local fast food restaurant where the players regularly hang out, Landry and Matt try to approach the coach's daughter Julie. She insists that she does not associate with football players. They assure her that Landry is not on the team and Matt gets virtually no playing time because of Street, but she still rebuffs them both. On Tuesday night a pep rally is held at the local car dealership. The owner and host is Buddy Garrity, who is also the father of Jason Street's girlfriend Lyla. Coach Taylor is surrounded by members of the local community questioning him about the game. It is gradually emerging how important football is to the town, and the great responsibility that rests on Taylor's shoulders. His wife Tami, meanwhile, is reluctantly recruited by the society wives to join their book club. Riggins' girlfriend Tyra Collette tries to stoke up trouble by flirting with both Street and Smash. Wednesday goes by with a team visit to a group of elementary school football players who idolize the older boys. The two teams recite the Lord's Prayer together. On Thursday night, the night before the game, Street and Riggins are at a party. Riggins lays out his plan of Street going to the National Football League and Riggins living off one percent of Street's salary. Then they can retire to a ranch where Riggins will act as Street's caretaker. They make a toast to \"Texas Forever\". On game night, coach Taylor gives a pep talk where he warns the players against taking the opponents \u2013 Westerby High School \u2013 too lightly. They say their rallying cry, \"Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!\" and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, and at the end of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that \"We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall.\""

In addition to writing the script of the pilot, he also executively produced the entire project together with Sarah Aubrey and John Cameron. Berg expressed regret in interviews about having to sacrifice certain story lines in the movie, due to time restraints. The television series allowed interpersonal issues to be addressed more in depth. \"The idea was to create a television show that exists as much more of a soap opera, or an exploration of human beings,\" said Berg in an interview, \"than as a chronicle of a football team's pursuit of glory.\" The series was filmed partly in Austin, and a call went out for local football players to play part roles in the show. In an attempt to maintain an authentic Texas environment, elements were incorporated from local society. Football scenes were filmed at the local Pflugerville High School's Kuempel Stadium and at the RRISD Complex, while uniforms were based on those of real-life Pflugerville Panthers."

She attends school, works with under privileged inner city children and lives with her two roommates.  Camille has been dating Calvin, who looks up to Camille's father and appears to be following him into medicine.  It is also understood that Camille will follow Calvin and work in some type of medical field.  Her life is considered by her and people around her to be \"normal\" and what is expected. Then on her 21st birthday she is attended to at a gas station by Billy Ryan Gallo, a mechanic during the day who turns out to be a blues musician at night.  When Camille shows up at Thelma's Bar later that evening, Billy formally introduces himself and then serenades her from the stage, much to her surprise and the amusement of her roommates. Camille runs into Billy again when she is out with Calvin and Billy is playing at the restaurant/casino.  Impressed with Billy's style, Calvin asks if he can buy Billy a drink and Billy joins them at their table and does not let on that he already has met Camille.  After a short conversation, Billy invites both to Thelma's Bar the following evening but Calvin declines saying he will be out of town. The next day, Camille goes alone to Thelma's and watches again as Billy takes the stage and appears to be singing only to her.  When his set is complete, Billy asks if Camille will go out and about New Orleans, a town where Camille has lived for over ten years but has never experienced.  The night sees Camille and Billy visiting clubs, riding around, laughing and dancing and being very free and comfortable with each other.  They then go to a club where she is handed a mic and impromptuly sings with a powerful voice that has Billy awed. As the chemistry between the two heats up, Camille retreats back to her safe world and Billy, respecting her decision, says if they cannot be more than friends, then would she consider singing in his new band.  Camille agrees and two begin a musical friendship.  They decide to try their act out at Camille's college's open mic night, Billy playing guitar and Camille singing.  All during the song neither Billy nor the audience take their eyes off of Camille and when the song is complete receive a standing ovation.  Afterwards, energised by their performance, Camille stares at Billy differently and unexpectedly kisses him.  Billy then kisses her back and asks her if she knows who she wants to be with.  Camille confidently tells Billy she wants to be with him and the two kiss again. With this new change, Camille realises that she wants to continue to work with the inner city children and not head off to some college and a career in medicine.  Newly inspired, Camille goes to tell her parents and is surprised to find Calvin and his parents at their house and Calvin asking her to marry him.  Overwhelmed by the pressure and her parents happiness, Camille agrees to marry Calvin and options out of her desired career choice.  She then meets with Billy and displays the engagement ring.  Furious with Camille for not standing up for what she wants and trying to make everyone happy but herself, Billy ends their friendship. Two weeks later at the engagement party, Camille's roommates observe Camille and find that their friend isn't herself and the whole event just \"doesn't feel right.\"  They take Camille aside and tell her that at any point she wants to leave, they will help drive her away. The party is an upscale social event attended by what Calvin calls \"very important people.\"  Camille decides to serenade Calvin with a love song and everyone in the audience is amazed by her talent except for Calvin and her father, who appear to be engrossed in their own conversation.  And while she sings, Camille's thoughts turn to Billy as she watches Calvin ignore her performance.  When the song ends she announces to everyone that she is not in love with Calvin but in love with a man who \"really sees her.\"  She calls off the engagement and drives away with her roommates. Camille goes back to her place, changes and drives to find Billy at the gas station.  He is standoffish towards her and asks her to leave but she stays to show him her bare ring finger.  Billy softens and understands the enormity of what Camille did and he again asks her if this is for real.  She smiles and says yes and the two kiss and hug and finally appear as a couple. The movie ends with Camille and Billy Ryan at Thelma's Bar, this time on stage together for the first time, in front of their friends and both of their mothers, singing a Love Song."

        "content": "A Bible verse, 1 Peter 5:8, appears onscreen. An unseen man narrates with a story about his childhood, where his mother explained the circumstances that surround The Devil roaming the earth. A man jumps to his death from a skyscraper, leaving a suicide note about the Devil's approaching presence. Shortly thereafter, an elevator in the building gets stuck with five people inside: a temporary security guard, a mechanic/former soldier, a mattress salesman, a young woman, and an elderly woman. A repairman cannot get the elevator working and nearly dies while attempting to. In the elevator, the lights frequently flicker and turn off completely for intervals. During an interval, one of the security guards, Ramirez, watching through the security camera sees a face on the monitor he believes is the devil, but his partner Lustig doubts it. At the same time, the young woman feels something on her back and the group becomes suspicious of the mattress salesman. When the lights return, the young woman has a bite mark on her back and the salesman has blood on his hands. Detective Bowden, who was investigating the earlier suicide, is called to the scene. The lights go out again, and the elevator mirrors break. When the lights return, the mattress salesman's jugular vein is impaled with a broken mirror shard and he dies, escalating it into a crime scene investigation. Outside, security guards, the repair technician, and the fire department attempt to get in, to no avail. The passengers begin to suspect each other, while the security guards monitoring through the camera talk to them one-way via the speaker, as they cannot hear the passengers. As the group argues, the repair technician's rappelling device breaks and he falls to his death. Ramirez tries to convince the detectives that this could be The Devil's Meeting, but is unsuccessful. An unknown woman attempts to enter the building unsuccessfully, and goes around to the back. Bowden and his partner use the sign-in sheet and elevator camera to identify the group. The temporary guard is identified as Ben Larson, who has a criminal record of assault and beating someone into a coma. The mattress salesman is identified as Vince McCormick, who lost many people their assets through a Ponzi scheme. The young woman is identified as Sarah Caraway, who is married to a rich man and plans leaving him after stealing his money, as she has done before. The elderly woman is identified as Jane Kowski, who was caught on the security camera stealing a woman\u2019s wallet. The mechanic and former soldier cannot be identified due to him not signing in, making him the main suspect. Upon review of security footage, the detectives see the mechanic had entered the building with a bag he does not have anymore. They find the bag filled with tools hidden in the lobby bathroom and suspect him more. Suddenly, the lights in the elevator flicker and shut off a fourth time. When they turn back on, the older woman is seen hanging from the ceiling by her neck via a light cable. Ramirez shows Bowden the devil face he saw earlier, but Bowden does not believe him. Bowden then discusses the death of his wife and son: they were killed in a hit-and-run five years prior, and the driver left a note that said \"I'm so sorry\" at the scene. As the detectives investigate the soldier, Ben and the soldier get in a fight, each suspecting the other as the killer. Sarah tells Ben to kill the soldier before he kills them and Ben attacks the soldier. Bowden comes back to the control room and diffuses the situation by having the passengers put their hands on the wall. Out of answers, Bowden asks Ramirez how to save them, if the devil is truly there. Ramirez responds, \"They all die.\" The detectives talk to the lawyer the young woman was supposed to meet with and try to contact Sarah's husband. Lustig, severely shocked, causes a scene by stumbling into the lobby and collapsing amidst the crowd. Bowden calls for the medics. In the elevator, Sarah takes her hands off the wall, but the soldier tells her to put them back. Bowden discovers that Sarah took all her husband's money and her husband might know it. After learning the husband owns the building's security company, they suspect the husband hired Ben to kill Sarah and that he killed the others to cover it. However, the fourth outage ends with Ben's neck broken. The soldier and Sarah suspect each other, arming themselves with mirror shards, but Bowden defuses the situation by telling them about his recovery from alcoholism following his family's death. The lights go out again, and Sarah's throat is slit. The soldier tries to stop the bleeding. The unknown woman from before is brought into the control room. She tells them that the soldier is her fianc\u00e9. He actually came for a job interview and he did not want to take his tools along, so he hid them. He has requested his fiancee to fetch him after the interview. His name is Tony Janekowski. The detectives realize he had signed in, and Jane Kowski, the elderly woman's presumed identity, was not real. The Devil manifests in the form of the elderly woman. Tony tries to trade his life for Sarah, but the devil says he cannot do that. Tony grabs the radio and confesses that he fled from a fatal accident five years ago. Bowden realizes that Tony is responsible for the death of his family. The Devil, powerless now that Tony has repented, vanishes after causing the elevator to plunge several floors. The firefighters are finally able to get in, but the old lady is gone. As the corpses of Sarah, Ben, and Vince are wheeled away, Bowden decides to take Tony into custody, and, while en route, reveals to Tony that it was his family in that accident. Much to his own surprise, he forgives Tony."

The film was shot primarily in Lancashire, in the north of England, during February and March 1973. Harrison supplied incidental music for the soundtrack and, after being introduced to the duo Splinter by their manager Mal Evans, produced their song \"Lonely Man\" for inclusion in a pivotal scene. Like many of Apple's film and recording projects, production on Little Malcolm was then jeopardised by lawsuits pertaining to Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr's severing of ties with manager Allen Klein. Speaking in 2011, Cooper said that Harrison \"fought for a very long time to extract Little Malcolm from the official receivers\", adding that its entry in the Berlin festival was only possible because the festival was an artistic forum and not finance-related. After what Cooper described as an \"incredible\" reception at Berlin for \"this very British film\", Little Malcolm went on to win a gold medal at the Atlanta Film Festival in August 1974. Once the Beatles' partnership had been formally dissolved, in January 1975, the film received a brief run in London's West End. In February 1983, Harrison donated his personal copy of Little Malcolm to a New York-based company for screening at a local film festival."

Frankie soon finds the weapon used to shoot Rita hidden in a ventilator duct. The gun belongs to Tex and had been used in a prior shooting by a woman named Gladys Wharton. When Frankie and Jeff audition for a comedy spot on the air, with Frankie in blackface as a disguise, the police come looking for Tex. Later, Tex is found murdered in the office of the station owner. Frankie and Jeff investigate of their own and search Tex's room but find only a picture of Anne, suggesting that her real name is Gladys. Anne is therefore suspected of the murder and arrested by the police, but later makes bail and is released. Frankie discovers from a radio station in Cheyenne that Gladys was a blonde woman who was married to Tex and fell in love with one of her superiors. Because Anne is a true brunette, Frankie concludes that Rita, not Anne, could be Gladys. When the station executives are gathered in one room by the police, one of them named Van Martin draws a gun and confesses to both crimes. When Jeff enters the room unannounced, he accidentally knocks the gun out of Martin's hand and the police arrest Martin."

        "content": "Johan \"JW\" Westlund is a man living in Stockholm and is a promising student at the Stockholm School of Economics.  JW is originally from the Norrland region in Sweden where his father, who has a slight drinking problem, works in a saw mill, while his mother works in an employment agency.  JW is wracked by the disappearance of his sister, Camilla, four years earlier. JW feigns the appearance of a \"Stekare\" (in Swedish parlance, a lifestyle based on flaunting one's apparent wealth), actually leading a double life driving taxi illegally to finance his expensive life on Stureplan. A romance with the upper-class girl Sophie leads to him being enticed into the world of organized crime. Abdulkarim, who is running the taxi business, offers JW a job in helping him start his cocaine business. Jorge Salinas Barrio is a Chilean man who went to prison after being caught in the drug business. He has now escaped and is on the run from the police. Jorge knows everything about cocaine. He has a plan: to avenge those who wronged him, among them Serbian Mafia boss Radovan Kranjic, and to make one final cocaine delivery and then leave the country for good. Mrado Slovovic, a hitman who runs errands for the Serbian Mafia, is sent by Radovan on a mission to take care of Jorge. At the same time, he has to struggle with taking care of his eight-year-old daughter, who he is forced to take with him on his job because the mother has a drug addiction. These three characters cross paths through their dreams about quick earnings. Once JW and Abdulkarim begin their cocaine business, they want to expand. Abdulkarim has heard that Jorge, who has escaped from prison by this time, has learned everything about the cocaine business while in prison. Simultaneously, Jorge has tried to blackmail Radovan, the Serbian Mafia boss. Mrado is tasked by Radovan to kill Jorge to prevent him from helping any of Radovan's competitors. Meanwhile, JW is promised 20,000 SEK if he can bring Jorge back to Abdulkarim alive. After noticing Mrado following Jorge, JW tails both of them, losing sight of Jorge when he gets on a bus. JW fortuitously finds them when he notices the car he saw Mrado drive away in standing in a forest clearing. When he enters the forest, he finds Mrado and one of Radovan's henchmen savagely beating Jorge. JW sets off the car alarm of the Serbian attackers to distract them. Meanwhile, Jorge hides from his attackers, who then travel further into the forest to find him. JW approaches a badly wounded Jorge and takes him back to his dormitory. Abdulkarim visits JW and Jorge and helps Jorge recuperate. Though hesitant about keeping Jorge in his dorm room, JW relents when Abdulkarim offers him 1000 SEK for every day Jorge stays. As Jorge recuperates, he learns more about JW and the two become friends. At one of the jetsetter parties, JW falls for Sophie (Lisa Henni), the on and off girlfriend of jet-setter Carl. JW learns that Carl's father's investment bank is in serious financial trouble and Carl may not be able to afford the extravagant \"Stekare\" lifestyle. This becomes important when Abdulkarim asks JW to figure out how they can launder the 20,000,000 SEK profit they will eventually earn. JW proposes that they buy shares of Carl's father's failing bank, giving it a stimulus that would not only save the business but immediately increase the price of the shares, making it more profitable. JW acts as the front man for Abdulkarim's cocaine syndicate as they attempt to purchase the bank.  Though Carl's father has reservations, he eventually relents and accepts the deal. Soon after, JW and the drug syndicate visit Jorge's drug dealer friends in Germany.  The drug dealers show how they smuggle drugs by inserting drug capsules under the skin of dogs and then letting the incision heal and the hair grow back which takes two months according to the drug dealers.  The drug dealers also place drug capsules in the leaves of young cabbage plants and then let the cabbage grow a full size head around the capsule. Abdulkarim's syndicate ultimately negotiates for a shipment of 40 kilos of pure cocaine.  The drug dealers want the money deposited in a Swiss account. JW immediately raises concerns about that plan, arguing that Switzerland is not that secret anymore and recommends an account in Andorra or Liechtenstein instead. This gains the drug dealer's trust and allows the transaction to run smoothly. Later, Jorge advises that JW that he is unlikely to see the money promised by Abdulkarim. JW visits Abdulkarim in his hideout and, while talking with Abdulkarim, realizes that what Jorge said was true. Mrado is waiting with his daughter at JW's apartment building and offers JW two million for assistance in raiding Abdulkarim's drug shipment.  JW agrees on the understanding that no one will get hurt.  The drugs arrive in an eighteen-wheeler full of cabbages.  Jorge and Abdulkarim's men start repackaging the drugs in a warehouse.  Meanwhile, JW assists Mrado and one of Mrado's Serbian friends in entering the warehouse. A firefight occurs and one of Abdulkarim's men is seriously wounded immediately.  JW is shocked by the turn of events.  Jorge realizes that JW has double crossed them.  Meanwhile, Radovan has phoned the police to report the drug delivery.  JW grabs a weapon and holds off the Serbians as the police arrive and a firefight breaks out.  JW and Jorge escape to the rooftop and eventually get to a car.  Mrado's friend is seriously wounded, but intends to hold off the others so that Mrado can escape.  As Mrado runs from an alley, he is hit and seriously injured by the car with Jorge and JW in it.  JW, the least injured of the three, is angry with Mrado who had promised that no one would get hurt.  JW shoots Mrado.  JW then fires shots at the policemen closing in, thereby allowing Jorge to escape in the car.  JW then surrenders to the police.  Mrado is taken away by ambulance and calls his daughter on the way to the hospital.  Jorge drives off into a forest and is last seen running through a field similar to the field that he ran through after escaping from prison. The movie ends with JW in prison with tattoos of \"JW\" and \"Camilla\" on his arms.  He is visited by Sophie who still cares deeply for JW, but she is leaving Sweden to stay at her parents\u2019 house in France.  She asks JW if he cares for her. JW appears to care for Sophie, but says nothing.  As Sophie leaves, she relays a message from Jorge who says that Paola had a baby girl. JW says that if Jorge calls again, tell him that '\"Mr. Brains\" says 'Hello.'\""

Ever since it came out, Swedish director Daniel Espinosa dreamed of getting the opportunity to adapt it into a film. The opportunity came only a few years later when he met film producer Fredrik Wikstr\u00f6m who asked him to direct the film. Espinosa has said that the book is important to him because of his Chilean roots and because he was raised in the Swedish suburbs. \"When I lived in Skog\u00e5s there were not so many Chileans, so I hung out with Yugoslavians [...] until I was 17 years old. Then a lot of crazy stuff happened and I ended up at Sigtuna with a bunch of upper class brats.\" Joel Kinnaman was cast in the lead role of Johan \"JW\" Westlund. He told Helsingborgs Dagblad that \"It is a difficult role and a difficult character to play. I love my character deeply, but he makes a lot of decisions in life that are idiotic and he chooses paths that lead to disaster and that gets unbelievably painful consequences for both him and the people that mean something for him.\" Filming began in March 2009 in Stockholm. Other shooting locations include Gothenburg and Germany (9\u201311 June 2009). In December 2009 Lapidus told the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that he had seen an early version of the film and \"it feels good. The film is based on my book, but is at the same time a story of its own. Naturally my main characters are in it and they have managed to capture the authentic feel, but I haven't written the manuscript, I've only given pointers.\" Lapidus has written two back-to-back sequels to Snabba cash, which are also to be adapted into films. Filming began in the summer of 2011 with Babak Najafi as director and most of the main cast members from the first film. Easy Money II: Hard to Kill was released in August 2012 and the second sequel Easy Money III: Life Deluxe was released on 30 August 2013."

Rashmi's family is in a deep sorrow and her father blames Mohan Kumar, a young and a bold politician for his daughter's death. Soon all started doubting Mohan and party decided to terminate him from being elected as an MP and heirs Jose  as new MP. However Jose didn't believe any false statements from the society and was sure that Mohan is innocent. James Joseph  made everyone believe Mohan to be the culprit and arrested him for a time being. As the case goes on, Shyam Prasad  is appointed to investigate the case. He is assisted by Basher, detective Chandrachoodan and Shekhar and all tries hard to find out the reason behind Rashmi's suicide. Shyam and team goes to Rashmi's house to enquire her whereabouts. Her father without saying much claimed that Mohan was the real reason for Rashmi's death. Suresh, their relative further makes more clarification about marriage between Mohan and Rashmi. John Samuel  and James decides to get rid of Shyam and sends a few goons in order to finish him off. But Shyam courageously defeats all and arrests John Samuel and James. Shyam further continues his mission. After undergoing many researches and proofs such as fingerprints, Shyam discovered the death of Rashmi to be a murder rather than a suicide. In a conference confronted by IG  and Chief Minister, Shyam clearly delivers to the people in the conference Hall that Rashmi's murder was committed by Sumesh who was Rashmi's ex-boyfriend. The crowd began doubting that how could a simple man like Sumesh kill his own girlfriend. Shyam and team brings Sumesh's friend to get more information regarding the flashback of what had happened a night when Sumesh reached Rashmi's house. Shyam also takes Sumesh to question him why he had done it. But Sumesh said that he hasn't killed Rashmi. However when Basheer and Shekhar provoked him, he got in a rage and finally said that he killed Rashmi saying that Shyam and team have no proofs regarding the murder. He wounds himself and goes back to the conference Hall so as to fool everyone. But whatever he said to Shyam was completely displayed on a screen. Shyam knew how Sumesh had done it but was keen that Sumesh has to say everything. In a flashback, Sumesh and Rashmi studied in same college where Mohan was the teacher. Even though both had fallen in love with each other Rashmi soon began opposing Sumesh as per her family's wish. Sumesh had no patience to listen her words and thought that she had betrayed him. So in order to seek revenge, Sumesh decided to kill Rashmi after coming to know that she is married to Mohan. He seeks the help of his friend and got addicted badly in drugs. He learnt the schedule of Rashmi in the absence of Mohan and had stolen the key of Rashmi's bedroom to make a duplicate one. One night after arriving from Bangalore, Sumesh gets down from bus and rushed towards Rashmi's house without his friend's knowledge. This was the time Mohan went from home after an argument with Rashmi regarding freedom. So he waited for his chance and bought required tools along a bottle strong poison with him. At first he poisoned a jar of milk kept in the room. But the plan was a failure. Nextly he had climbed up the ladder to reach the ventilator and attached some pieces of plastic pipes after tying a thread on its end. As Rashmi slept, Sumesh bought the thread to Rashmi's mouth without even a single noise. He then sent poison to Rashmi's mouth via the pipe and thread. That was how Rashmi lost her control and died. After that he burnt all the materials including bottles, gloves and dropped the bottle that contained poison to make everyone believe that it was a suicide. Back to the present, Shyam further explains that he understood the method of murder by observing the poison drops being dropped from Rashmi's bed to the ventilator in a straight way and often the drops were of different size. He further explained that the culprit had gone inside the house to switch off the inverter. This was to make the ceiling fan out of use in order to keep the thread used for the murder steadily. Police then arrests Sumesh and the Chief Minister and IG appreciates Shyam while Rashmi's family apologises to Mohan as his innocence is being proven. Mohan and Shyam smile each other of happiness. The film ends as Shyam Prasad and teams leave the conference hall."

        "content": "The film is about the life of a young couple Robert (David Hemmings) and Claire Williams (Gayle Hunnicutt), whose idyllic existence is turned topsy turvy when their 6-year-old son David (Adam Bridge) dies accidentally by drowning. Through a series of flashbacks it is shown that Claire was deeply traumatized by the loss of David and after numerous suicide attempts due to her mental breakdown, she was finally hospitalized in a mental hospital. Her husband Robert had been trying to cope with the stress as well but it is apparent that the situation had become increasingly difficult for them both. After Claire gets released from the hospital, with the hope of Claire's full recovery, the couple plans a trip to the countryside where they can relax in the Georgian home, a secluded large manor which was left to Claire by her recently deceased aunt. Their trip gets hindered due to the foggy weather. The fog is so thick that Robert avoids ramming into an oncoming car and hits a tree. When they finally reach the ancient mansion, it seems like the perfect setting for the couple to rekindle their romance but things disintegrate quickly. The situation reaches a breaking point after Claire begins hearing strange unidentifiable voices in the house. Eventually the voices take shape and Claire comes face to face with the ghostly figure of a young girl Jessica (Eva Griffiths) playing with a toy ball who doesn't seem aware of the couple's presence. But she isn't the only ghost haunting the old house. Her mother and brother are also present. Claire desperately tries to convince Robert that she had indeed seen the ghosts but he refuses to do so. However, later both Claire and her husband Robert experience a series of unexplained supernatural events that leave them questioning their sanity as well as their very existence. When the couple finally decides to leave the house and go back to their car, they find out they are dead. Their car had indeed crashed into a tree and their bodies were still inside the wrecked car."

On the same day, Traffic Constable Sudevan joins back on duty, after having been suspended from service for taking bribe as he wanted to pay the fees for his niece's admission. The day is special for Dr. Abel who is celebrating his first wedding anniversary. Raihan, an aspiring television journalist, starts his first job with an interview with Siddharth Shankar the very same day. On the same day, at a crowded traffic junction in Kochi, Raihan and Rajeev, travelling in a bike are fatally hit by a speeding car at the signal. Raihan is all set to interview the superstar, Siddharth Shankar. Also at the junction, in another car, is the surgeon Dr. Abel. Raihan goes into coma and is declared brain dead although he is kept alive using ventilator in Lakeshore Hospital Kochi. Meanwhile, Siddharth's ailing daughter Riya's condition becomes worse. She is admitted to Ahalya Hospital Palakkad and she urgently needs a heart transplant. At first, Raihan's parents do not agree to take their son off the ventilator and donate their son's heart but Rajeev and Raihan's girlfriend Aditi persuade them into it. Now that the heart is available, the problem was with transporting it from Kochi to Palakkad. No helicopters or chartered flights are available due to bad weather and time concerns and so the heart will have to be taken by road. Someone will have to drive the 150 kilometres from Lakeshore Hospital in Kochi to Ahalya Hospital in Palakkad in under two hours during the rush traffic. City Police Commissioner Ajmal Nazar is asked to carry out the mission. He initially refuses considering the complexity and risk involved in the mission. But finally, he heeds to the persuasion of Dr. Simon D'Souza. Sudevan, being an experienced driver who has driven as an escort for ministers, volunteers to be the driver of the Mahindra Scorpio which will transport the heart because he wanted to regain the name he lost due to the bribe incident. Accompanying him on this mission is Dr. Abel and Rajeev. Everything goes smoothly for some time. But at a point Dr. Abel threatens Sudevan that he would kill Rajeev if he didn't comply, forcing Sudevan to deviate from the highway into a forest road (Puttukad forest area) in order to save himself from the police. However, Rajeev retaliates leading to a fight. He phones his sister Miriam and speaks that he had hit his wife Shwetha with a car as he was infuriated with the fact that she was cheating on him with his best friend Jikku and that she has possibly died, so he wishes to save himself from the clutches of the police. Here Siddharth Shankar phones him and convinces him that he can save Abel, however, Abel is shown not to be so convinced. In the nick of time, Shruti, Siddharth Shankar's wife explains her mental traumatic condition due to the heart problem of her daughter for the last 13 years. And explains that no other problem can be bigger than this one. Abel now convinced, advises Sudevan and Rajeev to leave. However, Sudevan decides to have Abel with them in the team and in spite of the repeated suggestions from the Commissioner Nazar to get him arrested. They are then shown to enter a road 8\u00a0km ahead of the route time table, thus making up for the time they lost in the forest. However, after some time Riya's conditions worsen, forcing the team to take an alternate route through a communally sensitive place called Bilal Colony. It is shown that police cannot enter the place due to its strong minority. Rajeev seems to know the place well and advises Siddharth Shankar to get the place cleared for the vehicle to move. Siddharth Shankar personally phones Thanzeer the Fans Club President who goes out of his ways and means to clear roads for the vehicle. Rajeev exits the vehicle as soon as they enter the colony to ensure the roads are clear. In midway, Abel also exits the vehicle to remove two vehicles which are blocking the route. After which Abel boards the car with Thanzeer's assistance, however, Rajeev is unable to board the car. Sudevan drives at high speeds and ensures that they reach Ahalya Hospital on time. Covering the challenging 150\u00a0km feat in a daunting 1 hour and 58 minutes. It is shown that Shwetha is out of danger and has no complaints regarding the accident against Abel, thus freeing him. Rajeev is offered a lift to Kochi by an unnamed man. Raihan's parents invite Aditi home as a symbol of acceptance and prepare for the last rites of Raihan. Riya opens her eyes, bringing joy to her family, Nazar feels a sense of satisfaction and phones Dr. Simon D'Souza to thank him. Sudevan en route to his home finds a few people fighting on the road regarding a minor accident, where he signals them to stop the fight. Thus the movie ends on a happy note."

It is apparent early on that he's fighting with developers that want his land while he wants to preserve his family's legacy.  The developers had taken over a prior farm and turned it into an amusement park, something that Grandpa does not approve of.  The boys explore as children will and find their grandfather is harboring a large turtle-like creature called Mel.  Mel is a legend of local Swanson Lake and is known as Swannie to the general populace (similar to \"Nessie\").  The boys' adjustment to their life in the small town is helped by getting to know him.  While going around with a girl (Susie) one day, Roger (the elder boy) accidentally causes an explosion on the developer's property with his grandfather's tractor.  When the sheriff comes by to arrest Grandpa, Roger tells them he was the one who caused the wreck but they still put Grandpa in jail.  Bonnie and Peter (the boys' parents) come to stay at the farm when Grandpa is jailed.  The boys end up staging a breakout for Mel from the amusement park and with the help of Susie and her brother try to get him back to the lake, setting a tiger loose and creating mayhem in the process. At the end of the film, Mel is stolen by sex traffickers and is exploited until the gang comes to his rescue again. Once Mel is saved he is set free back into his home waters of Slough UK."

One thing many people do not know about this 1998 cult classic is how John Travolta was the true magic behind Mel. Weeks and weeks within the Mel suit truly earned John a place among the greatest actors in history. On set John's brother, Joey Travolta would force him to get inside the damp, humid and disturbing animatronic. It was said that after the film was made John had PTSD from being inside the suit for such long periods of time. Moreover, the jagged edges in the suit/animatronic sliced up his back leaving him in critical condition. This completely halted all production of Grease 2."

It is owned by the Lord family, a husband and wife with several children. Lillian Lord runs the shop, while Henry is a British Railways train driver, who has worked on the railways for over 30 years and who is just about to retire. He is looking forward to enjoying a quiet retirement at the family shop looking after his pet hare, Winston, though his spiritualist sister in law Ada has had supernatural visions of \"men in black\" bringing discord. Their plans are disrupted by the arrival of Filch, a senior civil servant dressed in a black suit. He announces that he is overseeing work on the Festival of Britain, due to begin in just six weeks. He explains that, due to an error by one of the planners, the Lords' shop and house will have to be demolished to allow an entrance route to be built assuring them that they will be financially compensated and will be moved to a new house in South Harrow. He expects this to settle the matter. However, the Lords show reluctance to leave their house with Henry demanding \u00a36 million if he is to move; an amount he calculates by Mr Filch's account of the estimate of the monetary value the Festival of Britain will bring.  Filch goes away hoping either to buy them off eventually or to forcibly evict them. Filch has underestimated how attached they are to their property, which is a symbol of security and family to them after their years of hardship during the Great Depression and the Second World War where they lost a son. In an attempt to halt the eviction the Lords appeal to a series of political figures including their councillor, mayor and MP. They are eventually sent to the official in charge of the work, who insists it must go ahead. They are served with eviction notices, and demolition is due to begin in a few days. Filch expects them to leave now, but they are unmoved by these threats, declaring that they would rather go to jail than South Harrow. When it becomes clear that their appeals from political channels are not working, the Lords turn to more active resistance at the urging of Cyril, their daughter's fianc\u00e9. They begin barricading their house and preparing to fight the government's attempts to turn them out. At the appointed hour, Filch demands they leave the house but they refuse. They are joined by Maurice Hennessey, an ambitious BBC broadcaster hoping to use the case as a springboard to greater career success. He begins a running commentary on the events to the outside world. Filch brings in a large number of police who attempt to storm the shop, but are driven off by missiles and flour bombs. After the assault descends into chaos, Filch launches a prolonged siege in the hope of starving them out. The Lords soon become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, with support coming in from across the world, putting further pressure on the civil servants who are desperate to get work completed before the Festival begins. In spite of their popularity, the Lords' situation begins to grow desperate as they run out of food. Just as they are about to give in Filch arrives and announces that, following the personal intervention of the Prime Minister, the architects have redrawn their plans and the road will now go either side of the shop thereby saving it from demolition. The film ends with the family including Winston enjoying a day out at the Festival of Britain with Ada flying into the clouds."

Lenkov, based on a story developed by Lenkov, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and was directed by Len Wiseman. The episode introduces the four main characters: Alex O'Loughlin as series protagonist and Navy SEAL, Lt. Commander Steve McGarrett, Scott Caan as Steve's partner Danny Williams, a former Detective from New Jersey who moved to Hawaii to be close to his daughter, Grace, Daniel Dae Kim as Chin Ho Kelly,  a disgraced HPD cop and Grace Park as Kono Kalakaua, a former surfer-turned-HPD Academy graduate who is also Chin's cousin. In the pilot, McGarrett returns to Hawaii to find Victor Hesse (James Marsters), a terrorist who murdered his father, John McGarrett. The Governor of Hawaii, Pat Jameson (Jean Smart) offers McGarrett to head a new task force to fight serious crimes by any means. Since the end of the original Hawaii Five-O series, there had been a number of attempts to create a remake, but ultimately none went beyond the pilot stage. CBS later hired Lenkov to pitch a pilot story. Kurtzman and Orci were approached; while originally hesitant to participate in the project, they were impressed with Lenkov's pitch. The episode was filmed in March 2010 and took over two weeks to shoot. When the episode became too long certain sequences were cut from the final product, including the funeral scene with Taryn Manning as McGarrett's sister; the character would be introduced in a later episode. Almost 14.2 million Americans viewed the pilot, increasing to 17.59 million when Live+7-day digital video recordings (DVR) are taken into account, and was also considered a ratings success in other countries. Critical reactions were generally positive."

        "content": "The episode begins in Pohang, South Korea, where Navy SEAL commander Steve McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin) is transporting prisoner Anton Hesse (Norman Reedus). Anton's brother, Victor (James Marsters) calls McGarrett to announce he is holding his father, John McGarrett (William Sadler), in Honolulu, and wants to make an exchange. However, Victor is in fact tracking McGarrett's convoy; two helicopters arrive and ambush it. In the midst of the skirmish, McGarrett is forced to kill Anton when he brandishes a weapon. In response, Victor executes John. McGarrett returns to Hawaii to attend his father's funeral, where he meets state governor Patricia Jameson (Jean Smart). Jameson offers McGarrett to lead a new task force to apprehend Hesse and clean up the criminal underworld in the state by any means. However, McGarrett initially refuses and goes to his father's home to investigate the crime scene. While searching the house he finds that Hesse has an accomplice, and also notices a tool box marked \"Champ\" (in the beginning of the episode, John referred to his son as \"champ\" despite never calling him that before). As he takes the box, which has evidence on a case John must have wanted his son to solve, he is confronted by the lead detective in the case, Danny Williams (Scott Caan), a divorcee from New Jersey who moved to Hawaii to be close to his daughter Grace (Teilor Grubbs) after she moved with her mother and her new husband. Despite initial friction between the two, McGarrett decides to accept Jameson's offer, and appoints a reluctant Danny as his partner. They find a lead in suspected gun runner Fred Doran (Jonathan Clarke Sypert); ballistics evidence suggests it came from a gun once owned by Doran. When they arrive at his quonset hut, he attempts to flee, but is killed by Danny following a standoff. Initially dismayed that Danny shot the only lead to Hesse, McGarrett finds Chen Chi (Allison Chu), a smuggled immigrant from China who was sold to Doran, leading McGarrett to believe human traffickers smuggled Hesse to Hawaii. In order to find out who, McGarrett and Danny turn to Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), one of John's proteges. He left the Honolulu Police Department disgraced after he was accused of corruption. After Chin Ho asserts his innocence, McGarrett offers him to join his task force. The trio meet with Chin Ho's friend, former police informant and current owner of a shave ice business Kamekona (Taylor Wily). Kamekona believes the snakehead leader is Sang Min (Will Yun Lee). In order to apprehend Sang Min, Chin Ho decides to appoint his cousin, Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park) as a plant. Kono was a former professional surfer turned police academy graduate. She goes undercover as a Chinese immigrant to meet with Sang Min. The conversation is monitored by the rest of the team through up-to-date laser audio surveillance, eliminating the need for a wire. However, it has emerged that Sang Min has a mole in HPD, who identifies Kono as a cop. The team storm the warehouse, and McGarrett apprehends Sang Min. In the interrogation, McGarrett informs Sang Min that if he goes to prison, his Rwandan wife and son will be deported, leaving his son at the mercy of the Hutu militias. If he cooperates, McGarrett will ensure they stay in America. Sang Min reveals that Hesse is going to leave the island on a Chinese freighter. Danny and McGarrett hastily drive to the docks. They then proceed to assault the freighter, where they dispatch several of Hesse's guards. McGarrett confronts Hesse, and shoots him off the boat. At the end of the episode, the new team settle into their new office space, and cannot settle on a name for their new unit."

        "title": "Pilot (Hawaii Five-0)_Background and writing",
        "content": "The idea for a remake of Hawaii Five-O first came about in 1996, when CBS commissioned a sequel starring Gary Busey and Russell Wong, along with a cameo appearance by James MacArthur, who portrayed the original Danny Williams, as Danny who was promoted to the state governor. Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, with Criminal Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced. Later, CBS approached CSI: NY writer Peter M. Lenkov to pitch a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov himself was a fan of the original. When executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman known about the remake, the two were originally hesitant to participate, but were impressed by Lenkov's pitch, since the story had \"such a great kind of paradigm for the show and how to really get into the characters that he really talked us into it.\" All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film. The producers discussed changing Kono to a female character. Lenkov noted that the producers did not have reservations as he initially though, but instead embraced the idea, as it would empower women in the remake by including them as main characters and not just victims or other minor characters. The pilot episode of the original series already established the Five-O task force, and when writing the pilot Lenkov wanted to give a proper introduction to the characters so that the audience can get to know them. Another difference in both the original and reimagined shows was the genre; the original was more police procedural, whereas the remake would be more action orientated, as well as some comedy mixed in, particularly from the banter between McGarrett and Danny. In the original script, there was no fighting between the two main characters, but the producers felt this would launch their partnership. Lenkov also included the return of an iconic catch phrase from the original series, \"Book 'em, Danno\". A table read-through of the pilot took place on February 19, 2010."

Intended for cinema and television advertisements, No Pressure is composed of scenes in which a variety of men, women and children in every-day situations are graphically blown to pieces for failing to be sufficiently enthusiastic about the 10:10 campaign to reduce CO2 emissions. The film's makers said that they viewed No Pressure as \"a funny and satirical tongue-in-cheek little film in the over-the-top style of Monty Python or South Park\". Before its release, The Guardian described it as \"attention-grabbing\" and \"pretty edgy.\" The film was withdrawn from public circulation by 10:10, on the same day it was released, due to negative publicity. Charities that had backed the film stated they were \"absolutely appalled\" upon seeing it, and several of 10:10's corporate and strategic partners withdrew from partnership."

Lizzie Gillet, 10:10 global campaign director, explained: \"With climate change becoming increasingly threatening, and decreasingly talked about in the media, we wanted to find a way to bring this critical issue back into the headlines while making people laugh. We were therefore delighted when Richard Curtis agreed to write a short film for the 10:10 campaign\". The film was shot on a location at Camden School for Girls, in the London Borough of Camden in North London. According to 10:10, over 50 film professionals and more than 40 actors and extras provided their services at no cost."

        "content": "The four-minute film consists of a series of short scenes in which groups of people are asked if they are interested in participating in the 10:10 project to reduce carbon emissions. Those failing to show enthusiasm for the cause are gruesomely blown to pieces. In the first scene, a bright and chirpy schoolteacher, played by Lyndsey Marshal, tells her class about the 10:10 campaign, and asks what they are doing to reduce their carbon footprint. She asks which students are planning to participate; most raise their hands, but two children shrug apathetically. The teacher reassures them that this is \"fine, it's absolutely fine, it's your choice\" and there is \"no pressure\", but then shifts the papers on her desk to reveal a red-buttoned detonator, which she presses. The two children who did not want to participate explode, covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts. The blood-spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain the night's homework to her horrified charges. The second scene shows a group of white-collar workers in an office meeting. The office manager, played by Paul Ritter, similarly explains the purpose of the 10:10 campaign, and asks who will be participating. While most raise their hands, four raise their hands unconvinced. The manager reassures them that there is \"no pressure\" to participate, but he is then handed a detonator by an assistant, which he uses to blow up the four workers, splattering appalled co-workers with gore. The third scene is set on a football pitch during team training. The coach, played by David Ginola, asks the players to explain the 10:10 campaign that the team is participating in. They describe a range of energy-saving measures which have been implemented by the team and its fans. However, the coach remains unmoved, remarking the campaign would distract him from football. A player tells him that there's \"no pressure\", produces a detonator, and blows him up. Unlike the witnesses depicted in previous scenes, the team is not at all surprised, and casually jogs away to resume training. A brief interlude with captions explains the campaign, accompanied by music from Radiohead. In the final scene, the actress Gillian Anderson is finishing the voice-over for the interlude just seen. The sound engineer asks her what she is planning to do to cut her carbon footprint. Anderson irritably remarks that she thought providing the recording was a sufficient contribution. The sound engineer repeats the film's catchphrase, \"no pressure\", and detonates Anderson before picking up to leave. The film ends with a shot of Anderson's gory remains sliding down the sound-booth window with the text \"Cut your carbon by 10%. No pressure.\""

        "content": "A handsome young stranger, Konrad Ludwig, is fascinated by a castle near the Bavarian village of Ornstein. He dreams of owning and living in the castle, which is the property of widowed countess Herthe von Ornstein, who lives in the dower house, unable financially to open and live in her castle. As Konrad schemes to become one of the countess's servants, he romances a beautiful and wealthy young lady, Anneliese Pleschke, daughter of a nouveau riche couple. The idea is to use their wealth to reopen castle Ornstein. After an afternoon of chauffeuring the Pleschkes around the countryside, he gets Rudolph, the countess's footman, drunk at the local Biergarten and then run over by a train. Konrad then takes Rudolph's place in the countess's household. Helmuth von Ornstein, a shy and attractive young man, and Lotte von Ornstein, a plain and annoying girl, are the countess's children. Helmuth is gay and begins to be romanced by Konrad when the stern majordomo, Klaus, tries to put a stop to it by firing Konrad. When the mayor of Ornstein is militantly disposed to root out all Nazis remaining in Germany, Konrad reports Klaus to the mayor after discovering he is harboring a scandalous secret: his father was a Nazi colonel, whose memory is fondly enshrined in Klaus's bedroom. Klaus is summarily and quietly put out of the countess's employ, leaving Konrad free to be Helmuth's lover while taking Klaus's place as majordomo. Konrad now plays up to the countess, encouraging her to throw a daring, expensive party at the dower house in order to initiate a pseudo romance between Helmuth and Anneliese Pleschke. Konrad, the lover of both Helmuth and Anneliese, induces them to become engaged to each other, while secretly assuring both of them that he would always be there at the castle. When the marriage contract is signed, the Pleschke money flows in to reopen and refurbish the castle Ornstein. The marriage takes place, but the honeymoon is a disaster with both the bride and groom wanting an annulment. The demise of the grand design is hastened along by Anneliese, who walks in on Konrad and Helmuth kissing. Anneliese, shocked and speechless, is ushered to the limousine in which she and her parents are to be driven to the castle by Konrad. When Anneliese hysterically opens up to her parents, Konrad turns the limousine down a steep embankment, managing to jump out before it crashes, killing Anneliese and her parents. Konrad escapes with a broken leg. Konrad goes through a pleasant convalescence with the countess herself becoming his new romantic interest. After an amorous night in the countess's boudoir, they plan to be married. Helmuth is devastated. He reluctantly allows the marriage to go on rather than have Konrad be forced to leave by a scorned countess. Helmuth's sister Lotte has other plans. On the eve of the wedding she informs Konrad that she knows all about his murderous and scandalous exploits. Ingeniously she avoids being Konrad's next victim and has him marry her instead of her mother."

        "content": "In 1942, 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski (M\u00e9lusine Mayance) hides her younger brother from French police by locking him in a secret closet and telling him to stay there until she returns. She takes the key with her when she and her parents are transported to the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver, where they are held in inhuman conditions by the Paris Police and French Secret Service. The deportees are transferred to the French-run Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp. The adults are deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, leaving the children in the camp. When Sarah tries to escape with her friend Rachel, a sympathetic Paris police guard spots them.  When Sarah begs him to let them go so she can save her brother, he hesitates then lifts the barbed wire to let them out. Sarah and Rachel fall asleep in a dog house at a farm where they are discovered by the farmers, Jules and Genevieve Dufaure. Despite knowing what they are and the associated danger, the Dufaures decide to help the girls. Rachel is dying, and when they call attention to themselves by calling in a doctor, a skeptical German officer asks them if they know anything about a second Jewish child.  The officer begins a search for the second child, only to be interrupted when the French physician carries out the dead body of Rachel.  Days later, the Dufaures take Sarah back to her family's apartment building in Paris. Sarah runs up to her apartment, knocking on the door furiously. A boy, 12 years old, answers. She rushes into her old room and unlocks the cupboard. Horrified by what she finds, she starts screaming hysterically. After the war, Sarah continues to live as a family member with the Dufaures and their two grandsons.  When she turns 18, she moves to the United States, hoping to put everything that happened behind her.  She stops corresponding with the Dufaures when she gets married and has a son, William. When her son is nine, Sarah \u2013 still despondent and blaming herself for her brother's death - drives her car into the path of an oncoming truck. It is explained to her son that her death was an accident. In the present, the French husband of journalist Julia (Kristin Scott Thomas) inherits the apartment of his grandparents (his elderly father was the boy who opened the door to Sarah in August 1942). Having previously done an article on the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, Julia finds her interest piqued when she learns that the apartment came into her husband's family at about the time of the Roundup and she begins to investigate what happened 60 years earlier. Her father-in-law tells Julia what he knows so she will quit prying. Julia begins an obsessive quest to find any trace of Sarah, eventually learning of her life in Brooklyn and finally locating William in Italy. She meets with him and asks him for information about his mother, but learns to her surprise that William does not know his mother's history or even that she was Jewish, believing only that she had been a French farm girl. Listening in amazement, William rejects the story and dismisses Julia. Later, everything is confirmed to William by his dying father, Richard, including Sarah's suicide. He gives William Sarah's journals and notes, telling him Sarah immediately had William baptized right after his birth, fearing that \"being Jewish\" was a threat to him and explaining that \"...we're all a product of our history.\" The key to the cupboard is among the items handed to him by his father. Julia, having given up hope of having another child after years of unsuccessful attempts to conceive, discovers she's pregnant. Her husband, though in the midst of an affair, selfishly leaves their life with their 12-year-old daughter, Zoe, as he does not want to have another child at this point in life. Julia ultimately decides against an abortion, has a baby girl, divorces her husband and eventually moves with her daughters to New York City. Two years later, William, having contacted Julia, meets her for a late lunch in a restaurant favored by Sarah and gives her additional information about his mother that the Dufaures had. Julia is amazed and happy for him, and has brought her young daughter along to the meeting. William breaks into tears when Julia tells him her daughter's name is Sarah. Julia comforts him as they both look at little Sarah."

        "content": "In 2169, people are genetically engineered to stop aging on their 25th birthday, when a one-year countdown on their forearm begins. When it reaches zero, the person \"times out\" and dies instantly. Time has thus become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in \"time capsules\". Several major areas called Time Zones exist; Dayton is the poorest, a manufacturing \"ghetto\" where people rarely have over 24 hours on their clocks, whereas in New Greenwich, people have enough time to be essentially immortal. Will Salas, a 28-year-old Dayton factory worker, lives with his 50-year-old mother Rachel. One night, he rescues a drunken 105-year-old man named Henry Hamilton from 75-year-old Fortis and his Minutemen, a group of time-robbing thugs. In a secret location, Hamilton, who has 116 years on his clock but is tired of living, reveals to Will that the people of New Greenwich hoard most of the time, while constantly increasing prices to keep poorer people dying. The next morning, he transfers all but 5 minutes of his time to a sleeping Will, then times out by falling off a bridge before Will can stop him. Raymond Leon, the 75-year-old leader of a unit of police-like Timekeepers, erroneously assumes Will robbed and killed Hamilton. Will visits his friend Borel, who warns him against having so much time in Dayton, and gives him 10 years, one for each year of their friendship, before going to meet his mother to leave for New Greenwich together. However, the city bus fare has risen from 1 to 2 hours, and Rachel, having used all but 90 minutes of her time to pay off a 2-day loan, is short on bus fare to return to Dayton. The uncaring driver forces her to run back to Dayton, but she arrives a few seconds too late for Will to save her and times out in his arms. Heartbroken and angry, Will vows revenge for his mother's death by taking the people of New Greenwich for everything they have. In New Greenwich, Will meets 110-year-old time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis and his 27-year-old daughter Sylvia at a casino. While playing poker, Will nearly times out but eventually wins over a millennium in a flawless gamble. Sylvia invites him to a party, and Will buys a new sports car and drives there. Raymond arrives and arrests Will, who insists his innocence in Hamilton's death. Rather than attempting to prove Will's guilt, he simply confiscates all but 2 hours of Will's time, explaining it does not belong in Dayton. Will escapes, taking Sylvia to Dayton as a hostage, but Fortis' gang ambushes them, taking most of their time and leaving them with 30 minutes each. Will attempts to get some time back from Borel, but his wife Greta tearfully explains that he has drunk himself to death. They manage to get a day each by selling Sylvia's earrings. Will calls Weis to demand a 1,000-year ransom to be paid into the time-mission for the desperate. When Weis refuses, Will releases Sylvia anyway. Raymond finds Will, but Sylvia shoots him in the arm. Will gives Raymond enough time to survive long enough for his squad to find him and steals his car. Now committed to ending the system, Will and Sylvia rob Weis's time banks, giving the extra time capsules to the needy, but soon realize that they cannot significantly change anything, as prices are simply raised faster to compensate for the extra time. Fortis' gang ambushes them, but Will manages to time out Fortis in an arm wrestling match and then shoot his thugs. He and Sylvia then decide to rob Weis' vault of a 1,000,000-year capsule. Raymond chases them back to Dayton but fails to stop them from distributing the stolen time. Having neglected to download his day's salary, Raymond times out. Will and Sylvia nearly time out themselves, but survive by taking Raymond's salary. TV reports show factories in Dayton shutting down as everyone has enough time and abandons their jobs. Having seen the consequences of his obsession with the pair, Raymond's colleague Jaeger orders the Timekeepers to return home. Will and Sylvia progress to larger banks, still trying to crash the system."

        "content": "Before the film was titled In Time, the names Now and I'm.mortal were used. On July 12, 2010, it was reported that Amanda Seyfried had been offered a lead role. On July 27, 2010, it was confirmed that Justin Timberlake had been offered a lead role. On August 9, 2010, Cillian Murphy was confirmed to have joined the cast. The first photos from the set were revealed on October 28, 2010. 20th Century Fox and New Regency distributed the film, and Marc Abraham and Eric Newman's Strike Entertainment produced it. In an interview with Kristopher Tapley of In Contention, Roger Deakins stated that he would be shooting the film in digital, which makes this the first film to be shot in digital by the veteran cinematographer. The Dayton scenes were filmed primarily in the Skid Row and Boyle Heights neighborhoods of Los Angeles, while the New Greenwich scenes were filmed primarily in Century City, Bel Air, and Malibu. Although the names of the ghetto-like zone and wealthy enclave reflect Dayton and Greenwich, respectively, the maps used by the Timekeepers are maps of Los Angeles. For the retrofuturistic setting, the production's vehicle suppliers assembled a fleet of cars and trucks from used car lots and junkyards. Although an old Citro\u00ebn DS 21 and Cadillac Seville feature, center stage goes to a fleet of seemingly immaculate Dodge Challengers and Lincoln Continentals. The rich drive around in the high gloss Lincolns, all of which have been smoothed, lowered and fitted with oversized disc wheels on low profile rubber. The Dodges are the Time Keeper's cop cars. These too have been smoothed and externally customized, with grilles front and rear covering the lights, and low profile tires on disc wheels. In stark contrast to the Lincolns, paintwork is matte black. A slim police light-bar is fitted internally, behind the windshield. The use of retrofuturism is one of many elements that the film shares with Niccol's earlier work, Gattaca; Niccol himself referred to it as \"the bastard child of Gattaca\".  That film also features electrically powered vintage cars (notably a Rover P6 and again, a Citro\u00ebn DS), as well as buildings of indeterminate age. Gattaca also deals with innate inequalities (though in its case genetic, rather than longevity) and also features a character seeking to cross the divide that his birthright is supposed to deny him. Similarly, he is pursued by law enforcement officers after being wrongly identified as having committed a murder."

He is placed in the body of a 14-year-old boy named Makoto Kobayashi, who has just committed suicide by an overdose of pills. Watched over by a neutral spirit named Purapura in the form of a little boy, the soul must figure out what his greatest sin and mistake was in his former life before his six-month time limit in Makoto's body runs out. He also has a number of other lesser duties he must complete, such as understanding what led Makoto to commit suicide in the first place. He finds Makoto did not like his family and he greatly dislikes them for the same reasons. He is contemptuous of his father who is an underdog at work, forced to work much overtime. Despite her efforts, he hates his mother who had an affair with a dance instructor, something his father seems to be oblivious to. His older brother, Mitsuru, has given up on him because he is too moody and has no friends at school. He discovers that a girl he fancies, Hiroka, sells sex to older men so she can have the clothes and things she wants. Shoko is a weird girl from Makoto's class who becomes suspicious of his unusual behavior, so he tries to stay away from her. After he gets mugged and beaten up by some delinquents, Shoko comes to visit Makoto at his house, but he scares her off. In one of their subsequent encounters, Purapura explains that Makoto will really die this time after his six months expire. However, when he befriends Saotome, a boy in his class who accepts outcasts such as him and treats them as equals, Makoto sees the joy in life for the first time. They spend some time together and they even begin studying for their high school entrance exam, something for which neither of them had any ambition before. Knowing that his brother will never get accepted to a public high school due to his bad grades and lack of interest, Mitsuru announces that he will postpone his college entrance exams in order to allow his parents to save some money so they can send Makoto to a private school. Makoto refuses and tells his parents and brother that he has already chosen Tamegawa High (a public school he and Saotome agreed on earlier). An aggravated Mitsuru is unable to comprehend his unwillingness to accept his family's help and asks him if he enjoys tormenting his own family. Makoto breaks into tears and says that he just wanted to go to the same school his only friend is going to apply to, which leads to his parents accepting his wish. With his deadline reaching its end, Makoto meets with Purapura for one last time. He announces that he has found out what his former life's mistake was. He reveals that he's none other but the soul of Makoto Kobayashi and his mistake was that he killed himself. Purapura tells him that he will keep on living, but that he will also erase his memories of Purapura in order to make Makoto not think that he has any more chances. Before wiping his memories, Purapura advises him to live a colorful life."

Tu'an Gu secretly murders the Duke of Jin and pushes the blame to the Zhao family, using that as an excuse to massacre the Zhao family. The sole survivor is Zhao Shuo's baby son, Zhao Wu, whose mother is the Duke's elder sister, Lady Zhuang. Lady Zhuang pleads with Tu'an Gu's subordinate, Han Jue, to spare her child. She then instructs Cheng Ying, a physician, to bring the child to Gongsun Chujiu, a friend of the Zhao family, before committing suicide. When Tu'an Gu learns that the orphan had escaped, he slashes his sword at Han Jue's face in anger and disfigures him. Tu'an Gu then issues an order to seal the gates and to gather all newborn babies in the city. The plan was to identify the Zhao orphan since Tu'an Gu was counting on the person hiding the baby to not hand over the baby to him, hence singling out the one baby left in the city to be the Zhao infant. Cheng Ying brings the baby Zhao Wu home, but his wife gives the child to the searching soldiers. Cheng Ying then asks Gongsun Chujiu to bring his wife and his real son (disguised as Zhao Wu) out of the city, while he stays behind to try and retrieve Zhao Wu from Tu'an Gu. Tu'an Gu finds Cheng Ying suspicious, but Cheng lies that the Zhao orphan has been taken out of the city by Gongsun Chujiu. Tu'an Gu then leads his soldiers to Gongsun Chujiu's house and finds Cheng Ying's wife and son. Mistaking Cheng Ying's son for the Zhao orphan, Tu'an Gu kills the infant, Gongsun Chujiu and Cheng's wife. Cheng Ying is devastated by the loss of his family and he swears vengeance on Tu'an Gu. He pretends to pledge allegiance to Tu'an Gu and brings Zhao Wu along with him and raises the child in Tu'an's house. Tu'an Gu mistakenly believes that Zhao Wu is Cheng Ying's son and adopts Zhao Wu as his godson. Zhao Wu gradually grows up under Tu'an Gu's tutelage and develops a close bond with Tu'an. Cheng Ying also forges a close friendship with the disfigured Han Jue and they secretly plot to help Zhao Wu avenge his family. One day, Cheng Ying breaks the truth to Zhao Wu, telling him that Tu'an Gu, who has been a fatherly figure to him for the past 15 years, is actually the murderer of his family. Zhao Wu is unable to accept the truth initially but his attitude changes as he hears from Han Jue about how Cheng Ying sacrificed his own son to save him. Zhao Wu and Cheng Ying finally confront Tu'an Gu, but Tu'an is aware of Zhao's true identity, because, over the years, he has noticed that the boy resembles Zhao Shuo. Zhao Wu engages Tu'an Gu in a sword fight but is no match for the latter. At the critical moment, Cheng Ying sacrifices himself to give Zhao Wu an opportunity to stab and kill Tu'an Gu. The film ends with a dying Cheng Ying having a vision of his reunion with his family."

        "title": "All things_Summary",
        "content": "\"all things\" is the seventeenth episode of the seventh season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files.  Written and directed by lead actress Gillian Anderson, it first aired on April 9, 2000, on the Fox network. The episode is unconnected to the wider mythology of The X-Files and functions as a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story. Watched by 12.18 million people, the initial broadcast had a Nielsen  household rating of 7.1. The episode received mixed reviews from critics; many called the dialogue pretentious and criticized the characterization of Scully. However, viewer response was generally positive. The series centers on Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called \"X-Files\". Mulder is a believer in the paranormal. The skeptical Scully was initially assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, a series of coincidences lead Scully to meet Dr. Daniel Waterston (Nicolas Surovy), a married man with whom she had an affair while at medical school. After Waterston slips into a coma, Scully puts aside her skepticism and seeks out alternative medicine to save Waterston. The script for \"all things\", the only episode of the series written by Anderson, was originally fifteen pages too long with no fourth act.  It was only after Anderson worked with series creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz that the script was finished. The cast and crew helped Anderson adjust to her directorial debut\u2014the first time a woman directed an episode of The X-Files. The episode makes heavy use of \"The Sky Is Broken\", a song from Moby's 1999 album Play, as well as a gong. The episode has been analyzed for its themes of pragmatism and feminist philosophy."

        "content": "FBI special agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is getting dressed in front of a mirror. As she leaves, her colleague Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies in his bed, half of his body covered by bedsheets. The narrative flashes back to a few days earlier: Scully arrives at a hospital and, after a series of coincidences, meets her former professor, Daniel Waterston (Nicolas Surovy), with whom she had an affair while attending medical school.  He is ill and suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition. She questions whether she made the right decision to leave him and abandon her medical career to pursue a career in the FBI. She meets Waterston's daughter, Maggie (Stacy Haiduk), who is extremely resentful of Scully for the effect she had on Waterston's family. Mulder\u2014on his way to England investigating heart chakra-shaped crop circles\u2014calls Scully and asks her to meet a contact of his, Colleen Azar (Colleen Flynn), to obtain some information. As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while driving her car, a woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting the woman. As she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a semi-truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck would have killed her. When she later arrives at the house of Azar, she observes that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance, but Scully is dismissive. Later, Scully returns to apologize to Azar and agrees to listen to her ideas.  Azar shares her knowledge of Buddhism, the concept of the collective unconscious, and the idea of personal auras. Azar believes these concepts might explain these strange occurrences. While visiting Waterston, he nearly dies but Scully saves him using a defibrillator; however, this also puts him in a coma. After a confrontation with Maggie at the hospital over what happened to her father, Scully walks through Chinatown. Seeing the woman who appeared earlier at the crosswalk, she follows her to a small Buddhist temple before the mysterious woman seemingly vanishes. Inside the temple, Scully has a vision of what is ailing Waterston. She returns to the hospital with Azar to visit Waterston. Azar and a healer provide alternative treatment for Waterston, who fully recovers. He announces that he still wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes she is no longer the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but it turns out to be Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of the last few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he turns to look at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep."

        "title": "All things_Conception and writing",
        "content": "Sometime during the sixth season of The X-Files, Anderson approached series creator Chris Carter and asked to write an episode that explored her own interest in \"Buddhism and the power of spiritual healing\"; ultimately, she wanted to write a script in which Scully pursued a \"deeply personal X-File, one in which [she] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her\". She wrote the basic outline of what became \"all things\" in one sitting, which Carter approved due to the \"personal and quiet\" nature of the story. Anderson's first draft of \"all things\" was 15 pages too long, and it did not feature a concluding fourth act. Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz thus began to work with Anderson to finish the episode, although Carter and Spotnitz later acknowledged that the majority of the script \"was all Gillian\". Despite her satisfaction with the final version, Anderson regrets a handful of the \"necessary\" script changes, most notably, the addition that Scully and Waterston's affair was intimate. In the original script, the two came \"close to having an affair\", but Scully ended the relationship when she discovered that Waterston was married. In the commentary for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston came close to having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil was too much for Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown in the finished episode. Anderson believed that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand Maggie's disgust with Scully. When Anderson first wrote the episode, she did not imply that Scully and Mulder had had sex. Spotnitz and the production crew, however, felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder's relationship had evolved into a romantic one. The idea of heart chakra crop circles was included because Anderson wanted \"whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from me, away from Washington, to somehow tie into what it was that I was going through\u2014the journey that I was going through\". As such, Anderson dedicated much of her time researching both crop circles and heart chakras, but she later gave additional credit to Spotnitz, who aided her in the research process."

        "content": "In a small town in South Korea, a corrupt detective named Cheon is asked by a church minister to arrest an unofficial street preacher, whose influence has been growing, and who has collected large donations. The donors are pressured into saying that they were defrauded, which leads to the preacher's imprisonment and subsequent torture by Cheon in order to extract a confession. To Cheon's surprise, the preacher demonstrates amazing endurance and will-power, leading Cheon to release him and to fund his preaching. Cheon uses their new-found friendship to bolster his own reputation and recruit henchmen. Around this time, a young girl named Lee is raped by three men, and Cheon earns her respect by beating them up. Around 25 years later, Ryoo, the estranged son of the preacher, is anonymously informed of his father's death and travels to the town, which happens to be the new jurisdiction of his acquaintance Park, a prosecutor. Ryoo encounters an elderly Cheon, whom all the townsfolk seem to venerate and fear. With Cheon are three henchmen, Jeon, Ha, and Kim, and also Lee, who became Cheon's wife. After the funeral, Ryoo stays behind to investigate, as he suspects his father was murdered, and finds several clues such as suspicious real-estate transactions. At this point, Jeon attempts to murder Ryoo, but Ryoo fights back and kills him. Ha attempts to murder Ryoo, who resists by lighting Ha's house on fire. Lee sees this and rescues Ryoo, and minutes later Ha burns to death, having entered the burning house to rescue his valuables. As it turns out, Cheon has been serially extorting townspeople for their land, which he re-sells, and he has murdered anyone who didn't cooperate. Owing to his political connections, the police never indict him. Additionally, a mass poisoning occurred at a prayer house during this period, leaving dozens dead, and the culprit was never caught. Park, having spoken with Ryoo, builds a case against Cheon over the opposition of his corrupt superiors, and the last henchman Kim agrees to testify. Sadly, Cheon eaves-drops on the conversation and has Kim murdered. Ryoo angrily confronts Cheon, who reveals that Ryoo's father, upon realizing the extent of Cheon's corruption, attempted to murder Cheon in his sleep. Lee, fortunately, agrees to testify and to hand over evidence. She explains that years ago she had opposed a tentative plan to dispose of Ryoo's father, and in retaliation, Cheon's three henchmen had raped her. As the town is raided by police, Ryoo, Park, and Lee confront Cheon at his house. Cheon is outraged that Lee betrayed him, and what is more, they argue over who did the prayer-house massacre. Cheon claims that Ryoo's father did it, while Lee claims that Cheon did it. In the midst of the raid, Cheon's son attempts to burn the evidence, and accidentally kills himself. As the police try to arrest Cheon, he shoots himself in the head, which brings the case to a close, though Ryoo's father's death goes unexplained. A year later, Ryoo visits his father's grave, and discovers that Lee has become the leader of the town. He suddenly recalls the anonymous phone call, as well as the convenient placement of clues, and realizes, to his horror, that Lee was his father's murderer. Having been tortured by Cheon, and wishing for an escape, Lee poisoned Ryoo's father so that Ryoo would arrive and open an investigation, the one which finally brought about Cheon's defeat."

At this point, Mukta (Smita Patil) steps into the witness box and recollects the whole story. Rajat was a music director. He meets dancer Mukta and falls in love. However, Mukta's father doesn't allow Mukta to marry Rajat and hence Mukta runs away to do a registry marriage with Rajat. Rajat and Mukta get married and everything is hunky-dory for some days. However, it is learnt that Mukta cannot bear kids. Later Rajat becomes the head of music composing for a leading advertising firm. Sheetal is an upcoming model who will stop at nothing to reach the top and stay there. She even makes advances on Rajat, who rejects all of them. She learns dance from Mukta and music is created by Rajat for her to dance professionally in advertisements. Meanwhile, Mukta and Rajat have a housemaid at their house. It is revealed that around 7 years ago, when the housemaid's husband tried to sell off his 10-year-old daughter Tulsi, Mukta intervened and decided to take care of the education expenses of Tulsi. When Tulsi returns to village, she paints herself as dark skinned so that she can stay in slums. However, Tulsi is actually beautiful. Tulsi, then decides to work as housemaid in the house of Rajat and Mukta. While Rajat decides to not work with Sheetal as she spoke ill of his wife, even his housemaid coincidentally falls ill and Tulsi becomes a housemaid at Rajat's house temporarily. Rajat terminates Sheetal's contract with his firm. This causes huge financial losses to Shailendra Inamdaarp's firm, as Sheetal has become famous and almost no model is ready to step into her shoes. However, one day, while Mukta is away, Rajat realises that to do Shafi Inamdar's show, he can replace Sheetal with Tulsi. Soon a portfolio of Tulsi is prepared. While returning from the launch party of Tulsi, Rajat's car breaks down due to heavy rains and Tulsi decides to change her dress in the house of Rajat. However, seeing Tulsi in dress of his wife, he gets excited and sleeps with her. Next day Mukta returns to house and dismisses Tulsi as she understands what had transpired between Rajat and Tulsi the earlier day. Sheetal, however, is unhappy as her need for power and attention is increasing. She starts spreading false rumours about Rajat and herself having an affair so that she can destroy Mukta's marriage. While Rajat is seen heavily drunk in the road, Sheetal brings him to her home and calls up Mukta to inform her that Rajat stayed with her the whole night. Mukta is disturbed by the rumours. Rajat tries to assuage her and assures that there is no such thing going on between him and Sheetal. However, with each day, Mukta's suspicion and bitterness towards Rajat grows stronger. Finally, Rajat too is unable to take this and calls it quits. Rajat says he is ready to sign divorce-related papers. After that, Rajat goes downhill. He starts drinking excessively and causes headlines for all the wrong reasons. Meanwhile, Mukta discovers that Tulsi is pregnant with Rajat's child and the housemaid dies when the slum dwellers make fun of Tulsi for being pregnant without marriage. Mukta tries to reconcile, but Sheetal coldly informs her that she has lost Rajat to Sheetal for good, no matter what the case appears to be and Sheetal lies that she needs Mukta's signature so that Rajat can divorce Mukta. Mukta becomes a recluse when Rajat leaves her and when she learns of Rajat's intention to divorce her. Tulsi decides to bear the child and she decides to give the child to Mukta and spreads the lie that it is Mukta's child. When Sheetal learns of Mukta's pregnancy, she sees to it that Rajat never learns about it. All this is witnessed by Tulsi (Sridevi), Rajat's housemaid. She is helpless even as Rajat stumbles deeper into the mess. Little does she know that she is going to be the turning point of rest of the story. Rajat, in utter desperation, decides to launch Tulsi as a new model. Tulsi has no other option but to go along with his decision. Rajat transforms Tulsi and sure enough, Tulsi starts gaining market. Sheetal is naturally enraged by this unexpected roadblock. The rest of the story is all about how the entry of Tulsi affects the relation of Mukta and Rajat further. Will Tulsi fall in love with Rajat? Will Tulsi marry Rajat? Will Mukta ever come to know that Rajat was innocent? Will Sheetal play spoilsport to Mukta's life even more? Will Mukta and Rajat ever be able to reconcile? What landed all of them in court?"

        "content": "Tabloid is a 2010 American documentary film directed by Errol Morris. It tells the story of Joyce McKinney, who in 1977 was accused of kidnapping and raping Kirk Anderson, an American Mormon missionary. The incident, known as the Mormon sex in chains case, became a major tabloid story in the United Kingdom and triggered a circulation battle between two popular tabloid newspapers, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express. The film is based on interviews of McKinney, journalist Peter Tory (1939-2012), and photographer Kent Gavin conducted by Morris. The film makes reference to Mormon culture, such as temple garments."

        "title": "Tabloid (film)_Synopsis",
        "content": "The film, narrated primarily by McKinney herself and supplemented by other interviews with primary characters and experts, is presented by animated headlines, newspaper photos, and brief televised news reports from the time of the case. McKinney details her upbringing as a charismatic young beauty queen with a self-reported IQ of 168. In search of a \"clean-cut, all-American boy\" for a potential husband, McKinney is introduced to Kirk Anderson, a young Mormon man on the eve of his  religious mission. McKinney states that she and Anderson fell madly in love and that they were engaged to be married, but that she mistrusted The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its hold over Anderson, declaring the church to be a \"cult\" that had \"brainwashed\" him. Former Mormon turned activist Troy Williams offers insight into Mormon practices, beliefs, and attitudes to explain how Mormonism might seem cult-like to one not raised in the religion. When Anderson was sent to England on his mission, McKinney, believing that the church elders deliberately separated them, recruited a pilot (Jackson Shaw, who appears in interviews) to fly her, her friend Keith \"K.J.\" May, and a hired bodyguard named Gil Parker to England on a \"rescue mission\" McKinney framed in terms of a romantic caper. Upon arriving in England, McKinney allegedly revealed items such as handcuffs, chloroform, and a fake handgun, causing Shaw and Parker to fear they were participating in a crime. Both men immediately returned to America, leaving McKinney and May to continue alone. McKinney secretly contacted Anderson and persuaded him to meet with her. On 14 September 1977, Anderson was officially reported missing. At this point, the accounts begin to differ, with McKinney claiming that Anderson went with her willingly to a cottage in Devon, where the two of them had voluntary sex for several days. Anderson, however, claimed in police reports that he was forced into a car at gunpoint, driven into the countryside, and chained to a bed by May and McKinney, where McKinney raped him, telling him she would continue to do so until she became pregnant. McKinney admits that Anderson was chained to the bed but states that Anderson consented to the bondage in an effort to overcome his intense guilt regarding premarital sex. Williams suggests that perhaps the truth lies somewhere between Anderson's and McKinney's differing accounts, and that Anderson may initially gone willingly or even engaged in consensual sex, but that McKinney may have ignored his later objections. McKinney, Anderson, and May spent three days in Devon, at which point Anderson proposed marriage to McKinney (later telling police that he did so in hopes of tricking McKinney into freeing him). The three returned to London on 17 September, where they discovered Anderson's disappearance was being investigated as a kidnapping. Anderson persuaded McKinney to allow him to go to police to assure them that he was safe. The story again diverges, with McKinney speculating that the Mormons threatened Anderson with excommunication if he refused to go along with the false kidnapping narrative. According to police records, however, Anderson reported that he had been abducted and sexually assaulted. Two days later, on 19 September, McKinney and May agreed to meet with Anderson in what turned out to be a police sting, during which they were arrested and charged with kidnapping, possession of a replica firearm, and sexual indecency (as there were no laws regarding the sexual assault of a man by a woman at the time). McKinney was held in  Holloway Prison for three months before being released on bail. At a pre-trial hearing, McKinney delivered a colorful statement professing her love for Anderson and detailing their sexual escapades, insisting that he had gone willingly and that their sex had been consensual. The newspapers, particularly the tabloids, were charmed by McKinney and the scandalous case, reporting every detail. McKinney and May were freed on bail, and McKinney spoke exclusively with the Daily Express, painting herself as an ordinary young woman in extraordinary circumstances. According to Express journalist Peter Tory, the popularity of the McKinney story led Express editors to involve McKinney in a series of publicity stunts, including using her to upstage Joan Collins at the premiere of  The Stud. Meanwhile rival tabloid Daily Mirror obtained evidence that McKinney had funded her trip to England by working as a call girl in the US. They collected a dossier of hundreds of photos of a nude McKinney performing BDSM acts, which they then published. A few weeks before her trial for kidnap was scheduled to begin, McKinney fled the UK with May, both of them traveling incognito in a variety of outlandish disguises. McKinney stated that the tabloids had ruined her reputation. McKinney was found guilty in absentia of skipping bail, the authorities having declined to pursue extradition. In 1984, seven years after her escape, McKinney surfaced again after her arrest for stalking Anderson (who, by then, had returned to Utah and married to another woman) at his workplace. In August 2008, McKinney again made international headlines after becoming the first private individual to have an animal commercially cloned. McKinney initially denied that she was the same woman involved in the \"Manacled Mormon\" case thirty years prior, but she eventually released a statement admitting her real identity. South Korean biologist Jin Han Hong, who participated in cloning McKinney's deceased pet pit bull, gives a brief overview of the process, stressing that their work cannot \"create life\" from nothing. McKinney claims to have spent the last thirty years writing a book entitled A Very Special Love Story about her life and the case, but that her efforts have been hindered due to documents having been stolen from her home and vehicle, including evidence proving the nude photographs published by the Mirror were doctored (Kent Gavin, former photographer for the Mirror, counters that the Mirror possessed the original negatives of all the nude photos but that they were lost when the Mirror changed ownership). She further claims that journalists and curiosity seekers continue to trespass on her property to this day. She has never married, stating that Anderson is the only man she will ever love. The film shows McKinney living in isolation with her aging father and her five cloned pit bulls in rural North Carolina. End credits reveal that May died in 2004 and that Kirk Anderson did not wish to be interviewed for the film."

Written by Doremus and Ben York Jones, the film tells the story of Anna (Felicity Jones), a British exchange student who falls in love with an American student, Jacob (Anton Yelchin), only to be separated from him when she is denied re-entry into the United States after staying in the country longer than her student visa allows. Doremus based the storyline of the film partly on his own long-distance relationship with a woman living in London while he lived in Los Angeles. Rather than writing a traditional screenplay, he and Ben York Jones compiled a 50-page outline of the film from which the actors improvised almost all of the dialogue. Filming took place over four weeks in Los Angeles and London with a budget of $250,000. Like Crazy premiered on January 22, 2011 at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the festival's Grand Jury Prize. It was released in theaters on October 28, 2011 and grossed over $3.7 million at the box office. Most reviews of the film were positive, with reviewers giving particular praise to the performances of Yelchin and Jones, although some found the plot implausible and contrived."

        "content": "Anna Gardner, a British exchange student attending college in Los Angeles, meets and falls in love with Jacob Helm, an American student who returns her affections. After graduation, Anna decides to spend the summer with Jacob rather than return to the United Kingdom, unaware of the consequences of overstaying her student visa, which expired upon her graduation. After returning to London for a family engagement, Anna flies back to Los Angeles, where she is detained, denied entry, and deported back to the United Kingdom by immigration officials. Despite her efforts at appealing the immigration decision, Anna is told she is banned from entering the United States. The couple's love for each other grows strained by their separation and long-distance relationship. Jacob then leaves behind his successful design business and visits Anna in London for a few weeks after calling her one night. There, he learns that Anna's parents, Bernard and Jackie, have hired an immigration lawyer to try to get the ban lifted. Bernard suggests that marrying may help their efforts. Jacob is uncomfortable with the suggestion, and the couple struggle with their feelings. After Jacob returns to the United States, he and Anna grow apart, and Jacob starts dating Samantha, a girl who's in love with him. Anna also tries to find a new life for herself, beginning work as a secretary for a magazine, but she is unable to abandon her feelings for Jacob. Later, while Jacob is talking to a customer accidentally tells \"Anna\" to get to phone, to which Samantha answers. Anna eventually calls Jacob from London, and both admit that they will never find in others what they found in each other and that they should marry. Jacob then breaks up with Samantha, returns to London, and marries Anna in a small registry office ceremony with her parents as witnesses \u2014 Jacob and Anna affirming that they will \"never allow anything to destroy the feelings we share for each other\". With a tearful parting, Jacob returns to his business in Los Angeles while the couple waits six months before they appeal the ban on Anna's visa. Six months later, Jacob flies back to the United Kingdom for the appeal, but it is rejected. With their relationship compromised and no hope of resolving the visa issue, Anna and Jacob begin to fight with each other out of jealousy and frustration. Jacob flies back to the US and rekindles his relationship with Samantha while Anna starts dating Simon. Anna eventually gets promoted at work to the position of editor\u2014something she had been working towards. Her love life, however, is not as positive or fulfilling\u2014she realizes Simon does not evoke the same feelings in her as Jacob, whom she still misses. Sometime later, Anna is finally offered a new visa. Anna invites her parents over for dinner to meet Simon, whom they end up not liking. Afterwards Simon proposes to Anna, to which she declines. She leaves her job, boyfriend, and apartment and flies to Los Angeles to Jacob, who greets her with flowers at the airport where they have an awkward reunion. Jacob brings Anna to his house where he joins her in the shower. As the water falls over them they remember happier memories they had together at the beginning of their relationship, which has now become strained due to their indiscretions during the time spent apart."

        "content": "Drake Doremus was inspired to make Like Crazy by the end of his eight-year long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller, who lived in London while Doremus lived in Los Angeles. Many elements of the film resemble their real-life relationship, such as frequent travelling between Los Angeles and London, trouble with American immigration laws, a brief marriage, a trip to Santa Catalina Island (where Jacob takes Anna in the early stages of their relationship), and the gift of a bracelet (in the film, a bracelet is given to Anna by Jacob). The story was co-written by Ben York Jones, who had also been involved in long-distance relationships. Together, they assembled a 50-page outline of the film which read more like a short story than a traditional screenplay. The outline included backstory, plot points, specific scene objectives, themes and emotional moments, but had minimal dialogue. Anton Yelchin was Doremus's first choice to play Jacob, based on Yelchin's previous work, and was cast almost immediately after meeting Doremus to discuss the role. After auditioning a number of actresses from Los Angeles and London to play Anna, Doremus talked to English actress Felicity Jones over the phone and asked her to tape rough versions of two scenes from the film. He was so impressed with her rendition of the film's final scene\u2014in which Anna and Jacob stand silently in a shower\u2014that he decided to cast her. After Jones arrived in Los Angeles, she and Yelchin began an intensive week-long rehearsal before filming began. Yelchin and Jones met in a Mexican restaurant to get to know one another and, during the week prior to shooting, spent \"all day and often all night\" discussing Anna and Jacob's relationship with each other and Doremus."

        "content": "\"Nuclear Strike\" is the series seven finale and 64th episode of the British espionage television series Spooks. It was originally broadcast on BBC One on 8 December 2008. The episode was written by Neil Cross, and directed by Sam Miller. In the episode, Tiresias, the Russian equivalent of Sugarhorse, awakens a sleeper agent to detonate a nuclear suitcase bomb in central London. The Section D team use Connie James (Gemma Jones), an FSB mole who helped set up Tiresias, to help them stop the bomb. However, the team find themselves targeted by an FSB kill squad, who are unaware of the bomb threat. The idea behind the episode came from an earlier series three episode about a series of Russian weapons caches throughout the United Kingdom set up during the Cold War. Cross also felt it gratifying to kill off Connie, a character he created in the sixth series. Filming took place during the summer of 2008, with much of it taking place in disused tunnels of the London Underground. The series seven finale was seen by six million viewers and a quarter of the television audience, a large increase of 900,000 viewers and four share points from the previous week. Critics reacted to the episode with near universal acclaim, for being a \"superb season closer\", \"exciting\" and \"thrilling\"."

Section D, having heard \"Tiresias wakes 3 pm tomorrow\" the previous episode, work on what the message means. Lucas North (Richard Armitage) and Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) discover Tiresias is the Russian equivalent of Sugarhorse, but \"bigger and better;\" while Sugarhorse placed pro-western Russians to infiltrate its government, Tiresias does the opposite; recruit spies to infiltrate the British Government. Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) believes Connie James (Gemma Jones), a mole from the FSB, might know what Tiresias is planning. Ros and Lucas release Connie from custody by posing as masked Russian agents. Later, it is revealed that FSB officers have been assigned to assassinate her. FSB head Viktor Sarkisiian (Peter Sullivan) orders a kill squad to search every MI5 safehouse, provided by Connie, to kill her and the Section D team who are harbouring her. At the safe house \"Ottawa Bravo\", Connie reveals she helped set up Tiresias over two decades ago and will give all sleeper agents and operations in exchange for safe passage to New Zealand. After listening to the numbers station broadcast, she reveals Tiresias has awakened a sleeper agent to a specific task; detonating a nuclear suitcase bomb in central London by 3 pm. The only way to know where it would detonate is a locker at London Bridge station, which contain all Tiresias members and codes. When they start their journey however, they encounter the kill squad. They and Lucas engage in a shootout, and after evading them, the team decide to split up and regroup in Catherine Wheel Alley, while Harry returns to Thames House. After returning, Harry warns Home Secretary Nicholas Blake (Robert Glenister) of the threat and tells him that if he receives a call from MI5 at 2:45 pm, he should order the evacuation of Parliament. Lucas, Ros and Connie regroup and head towards a London Underground station, but Lucas is wounded by a sniper; though not seriously wounded, the kill squad could follow Lucas' blood trail. To slow them down, Lucas sets up rudimentary traps and the three venture through empty tunnels towards the station. Later, the kill squad send in a runner to find the three; Lucas is able to trip and kill him. Back in Thames House, Harry believes the FSB are not aware of the bomb threat, and decides to meet with Sarkisiian face-to-face. In order to get there alive, Harry uses the emergency \"handshake protocols\" and reasons with Sarkisiian that he would turn himself into the FSB if he stops the kill squad. Meanwhile, Lucas attempts to draw off the squad by splitting up, but at the confrontation, his gun jams and is cornered. Before he can be killed, Sarkisiian calls the team off and orders them to help stop the bomb. Ros and Connie find the locker with the bomber's name and location, Grosvenor Square. An FSB sniper kills Crane, and at Connie's request, the bomb is sent to her, as she is the only person with the expertise to disarm it. Connie defuses the bomb, but by doing so a secondary countdown is initiated. While seemingly experiencing an episode of mania or insanity, she removes the nuclear material before calmly describing the device as \u201cjust a bomb\u201d, as the uranium is no longer present and that she isn't scared of them, but it will still detonate in her face as she is the one disarming it. In her last words, Connie admits that she set up Lucas in Moscow eight years ago, which resulted in his imprisonment. Lucas and Ros then run to safety as the bomb detonates, killing Connie. With disaster averted, Lucas calls Harry, but receives no answer. In the end, it is revealed Sarkisiian has him locked up in the boot of his car."

        "content": "The episode was written by Neil Cross. Before he started writing Cross did not know Connie was the mole from the previous episode, so he included it to help with the storyline. The character was originally intended to be killed by the end of the last episode, but Cross kept her alive until the end of the finale. He wanted her killed off at this episode, as he was the one who created Connie in the sixth series, and felt it gratifying to kill off a character he created. In writing the plot, Cross was inspired by the Rupert Walters script for \"Frequently Asked Questions\" from the third series, which revealed a series of weapons caches throughout the United Kingdom set up by the Russians during the Cold War; Cross wanted to use that as a way to introduce the nuclear suitcase bomb. The bombs design from the episode was based from actual designs, but invented its failsafes. The producers also intended to tease the audience that after the brutal killing of Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) from the previous episode, they would think that things could not get worse for the team, until the nuclear threat in the finale. The scene where the team breaks Connie out was intended to show the audience that the protagonists are willing to go to extreme measures to stop serious threats. Cross wanted to make it a very pure Spooks episode by setting up the entire plot in one scene, and then include a chase throughout London between FSB officers and the main characters. Cross enjoyed creating the FSB team featured in the episode, especially as he created them as a Russian version of the Spooks protagonists, but also make their base much more lit with windows. The bomb defusal scene was originally set at a graveyard, but the producers decided it would be best to set it underground. Though it took several rewrites, the script remained \"fundamentally the same\" throughout the writing process. The part where Connie asks for safe passage to New Zealand was a \"sly personal reference\" to Cross, as the writer himself resides in the country. In one scene, Lucas can be seen breaking into a car and getting his hands on various items that would be useful to help set up traps against the FSB officers. Throughout the episode's development, the items kept changing. There were also staff discussions about what they could get away with in terms of the protagonists killing FSB officers. The most prominent discussions included Harry strangling one officer with his necktie, and Lucas shooting another in the head in cold blood despite being unarmed and subdued."

As a young man Keaton travels on his own to Hollywood and tricks his way onto the grounds of silent-film studio Famous Studio as a workman carrying a board, as in one of his trademark comic bits. Sneaking onto a set, he attracts the attention of a young casting director, Gloria Brent. He demonstrates his type of physical comedy to a director Kurt Bergner, whom he does not impress. But Gloria recognizes his talent and recommends him to studio head Larry Winters, who offers him a contract. Keaton begins to get small parts in other people\u2019s pictures. As his comic talent becomes more apparent and his fame and money-making power grows, he is offered a contract to direct and star in his own silent films. Dissatisfied with not sharing the profits of his films, he is told that he must invest in his own pictures in order to profit-share. He does in \u201cThe Gambler\u201d, which is released at the same time as Al Jolson\u2019s blockbuster talkie, \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d, reducing public interest in it. Buster struggles to adapt to performing in talking pictures. He pursues a silent film star throughout his early career, Peggy Courtney, who sneers at his boarding-house manners and eventually marries a European Duke in order to become a Duchess. Crushed, Keaton begins drinking heavily. The casting director, Gloria, who has been interested in him and remained his friend throughout his career has been similarly disappointed by his lack of interest in her, and plans to marry a studio executive, Tom McAffee. Eventually, she confesses to her fianc\u00e9 her continued interest in Keaton, and they break up. While Keaton is in a drunken black-out, she marries him in order to move in with him and take care of him so he doesn\u2019t die. Buster doubts Gloria\u2019s motivation for marrying him and neglects and verbally abuses her. Things thaw between them; Buster has been offered a small part in a talking film by director Kurt Bergner. Buster quits the film in anger as he is not allowed enough screen time to develop any of his famous comedy routines. On his way home Buster meets some children playing baseball and joins them, making up comedy bits within the game at which the children laugh. When he returns home, Gloria mistakes his elation from having made the children laugh for having gotten the motion picture part. Pretending to go to work the next day, Buster returns to the baseball field, which is empty. Some tourists recognize him and ask for his autograph. He pretends to have forgotten his wallet and borrows $10 from them, which he uses to get drunk. Buster returns home drunk, and Gloria confronts him. He wonders aloud why she married him, and she declares her love for him. The children who played baseball with him arrive at his house to ask him to play baseball with them again. Gloria tells the children that he is sick and cannot play. Then she leaves Buster, hoping that leaving him will help him to face his drinking problem. The children show up at Buster's house again, and he entertains them, but he falls down and hurts himself as he is still ill from drinking. He puts his mansion up for sale and moves out. He goes to see Larry, the studio head, to ask if he knows where Gloria is. Larry tells him that Gloria has resumed her old job at the studio; he calls Gloria into his office and leaves the two alone. Buster demonstrates to Gloria that he is quitting drinking, and tells her that he is returning to his roots, vaudeville. He tells her that she is free from the marriage. Buster returns to vaudeville, where audiences still laugh at his routines. Gloria goes to see Buster backstage, and he impresses her into his act. Together, they are a hit. Buster tells Gloria that together they will be The Two Keatons. She raises three fingers to signal to him that they must be The Three Keatons, as she is expecting."

        "content": "Producing The Spine took two years, with the first year devoted mainly to development. The film was a more ambitious project technically than Ryan, and so required a much larger production team. Animators from Seneca College, which had been involved in Ryan, played a much larger role in the making of The Spine, with Seneca College people doing \"about 95% of the animation,\" according to Landreth. Seneca professor Sean Craig, who had worked on Ryan as a student,  was an animation director on The Spine. The film also utilized the input of C.O.R.E., including a team that did most of the computer rendering. The film was principally created using Autodesk Maya and Houdini 3D software. The screenplay for The Spine was written by Landreth while enrolled in a professional screenwriting workshop at Ryerson Polytechnic University. Some of the story was based on what he'd seen, 20 years earlier, at a group therapy session for couples, where it seemed to Landreth that portraying a dysfunctional relationship would make for an interesting story. It took Landreth just two hours to put the outline together, but completing the story took a year. The Ryerson workshop helped Landreth to flesh out his story and as of 2009, he continues to meet with his writing group once a month. Landreth also credits the production teams from the National Film Board and Copperheart for their creative input. Release The Spine had its world premiere at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, followed by a North American premiere at the Worldwide Short Film Festival in Toronto. In August 2009, Landreth presented the film at SIGGRAPH in New Orleans."

        "content": "The film begins with some insight into the Brahmin family of Patteri, a respected astrologer. He helps a police officer named Pothuval to crack an ill-famed temple robbery. The story then moves to the political arena, where the well-liked and righteous Chief Minister, P. Madhavan initiates a crackdown on corrupt Government officials, angering his party and ministers alike. In the by-election soon to follow, where he has to win to retain his position as the Chief Minister (CM), the party conspires against him for that matter. During a chance encounter with the CM, Patteri senses a bad omen regarding Madhavan's success and hopes maybe the by-elections won't happen. Meanwhile, an enigmatic and alluring woman is shown entering an apartment where she meets an accomplice and they go through the details of an assassination which they plan to carry out soon. Right before the Chief Minister's next election meeting, DGP Hariprasad shares his concern about an anonymous threat call that he received with DySp John asking him to tighten the security and to be with the CM at all times. But the plan is executed and the Chief Minister is killed along with the people on dais with him, including John. The initial investigation is headed by the IPS officer Meena Nambiar. Aided by a misplaced camera from the debris, suspicion is laid on the photograph of a \u2018killer woman\u2019, who sneaked into the venue using a forged journalist pass. They trace the local temporary residence of hers and arrest the home owner and his family on charges of sheltering the culprit, although he was tricked by the woman. The investigation advance no further and this provokes the Judge dealing the case; because for no solid reason, the home owner and his family are being punished, due to the inefficiency of the investigating officer. The sensational nature of the case, achieved partly because of Meena Nambiar's media obsession, causes a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to take over. The SIT arrives from Delhi and is headed by Bharath, an IPS officer posted in Central Ministry of Home Affairs, who is also Patteri's son. The initial friction between Bharath and Meena, dwindles to a friendship, once Bharath makes the first startling discovery. Bharath is targeted more than once by unknown assassins, on one occasion even inside the police HQ. While this frightens most, he gets convinced that the enemy is \u201cnear\u201d and influential. He grows suspicious of the credibility of the photograph of the \"killer woman\". The fact that the residence of the killer yielded no female fingerprints and that there is an unidentified male fingerprint in the same apartment reveals to him that the photograph was a decoy. The killer is male and the photographs were used to misdirect the investigation. They learn the whereabouts of the killer by first generating a male version of photograph of the killer and then publicizing it. They also apprehend the killer's accomplice. But before being able to capture the killer, who goes by the name \"Bose\", they find him already murdered. The investigation almost comes to a standstill, until they learn that there was a similar attempt before, which did not go as planned. The killer expected someone else to be with the CM, who was the Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dy.SP), John. They quickly learn that Dy.SP John was the real target and the death of the CM was a cover. The political conspiracy against the CM was used by the perpetrator to further misdirect the investigation. In search of a motive behind the assassination, the team finds that John was investigating an accidental explosion in a fireworks factory at the time. John was astonished by the findings of the case, where the explosives dealing license of the owner, Poozhimattom Thomachan, an influential politician, was being employed for dealing with larger quantities of explosives driving terrorist activities in the country. John was killed for discovering the criminal activities and the murder of the state Chief Minister was used to distract the investigators. The perpetrator also feared the response of the Chief Minister should John's investigation report were to reach his hands. The team's most astounding find then follows, with the discovery of the puppet master and the silent partner in the illegal explosive deals of Thomachan. The Director General of Police (DGP) Hariprasad, who administered the investigation from the beginning, is revealed to be the real perpetrator. He misled the previous investigation, initiated various attempts to murder Bharath to scare the team away and played the faithful ally throughout. The team submit the report and the guilty are put behind bars. The film ends with the Special Investigation Team flying back to Delhi, with a promise of promotion for Pothuval, their local help."

Sam's boss urges him to bribe federal officials. Returning home, Sam's girlfriend Hannah informs him that his estranged father, Jerry, has died. Sam and Hannah fly to Los Angeles, where he has a tense reunion with his mother, Lillian. Jerry's lawyer and friend, Ike, tells Sam he will not inherit any money. The lawyer hands him a shaving kit containing $150,000 in cash and a note stipulating that the money be delivered to Josh Davis. Josh is a troubled 11-year-old boy whose bartender mother, Frankie Davis, is a recovering alcoholic. Sam secretly follows Frankie to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. He learns she is Jerry's illegitimate daughter, making Frankie Sam's paternal half-sister, and Josh his nephew. When Sam tells Hannah he intends to keep the money, Hannah, disgusted, returns to New York. Sam introduces himself to Frankie as a visiting fellow alcoholic, and soon becomes involved in their life, gradually growing closer. He learns that Jerry visited Frankie and her mother on Sundays, and that Frankie has never met her father's wife and son. Meanwhile, Sam broods over his deepening legal troubles. Frankie does not want Sam around Josh anymore because she fears he will return to New York, upsetting Josh. Sam decides to leave, but returns to pick up Josh from school. Frankie later calls Sam, telling him Josh has been in a fight. Sam eventually reveals that he is Jerry's son, resulting in Frankie exploding in anger and ordering him to leave. Later, Lillian is hospitalized following a heart condition. Hannah finds Sam in the waiting room, and they reconcile. Hannah has enrolled into UCLA's law program to remain close to Sam after realizing he wants to be with his family. Meanwhile, Frankie receives Jerry's money through a lawyer. Frankie quits her job, enrolls in school, and move into a suburban neighborhood with Josh. She cuts contact with Sam. After being discharged from the hospital, Lillian tells Sam that she forced Jerry to choose their family over Frankie and her mother. She was protecting Sam, but Jerry instead rejected his son because he was a reminder of the daughter he abandoned. One day, Josh, who is having difficulty adjusting to Sam's absence, tries to find him after obtaining Lillian's address. When Sam visits Frankie, he asks her forgiveness and wants to be her brother and Josh's uncle and father figure. He shows her an old film reel that Jerry shot of a young Sam at a playground. In the film, a girl joins Sam, and Frankie realizes that Jerry had regularly brought her and Sam to play together and thus loved both his children. At this recognition, Frankie accepts Sam as her brother."

However, when Avery suggests naming the baby Charlotte, Jack declines, saying that his employee and mentee Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) knew somebody called Charlotte in middle school and did not like her. This annoys Avery, who is concerned about the nature of Jack's relationship with Liz and tells him that he needs to put some boundaries in place. Despite Jack's argument that Liz is his mentee and that he does not choose such people lightly, Avery demands that he starts treating Liz like his other employees. Despite this, Liz finds she cannot resist calling Jack for advice and pretends to be German when Avery answers Jack's phone. Meanwhile, Liz has her own problems when her father, Dick Lemon (Buck Henry) calls her to say that he is coming to visit her in New York, but will not be bringing his wife and Liz's mother, Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette), with him. When he shows up at her apartment, he reveals that he and her mother are on a break. Liz, however, believes that he is just pretending that there are problems with his marriage and that he is actually in town for a \"gentleman's intermission\", so she refuses to let him stay with her. Unfortunately, her attempts to turn to Jack for help are thwarted by Avery, who is insistent that she work out her own problems instead of always coming to Jack. At the 30 Rock studios, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is shocked when he discovers a group of editors putting together an obituary for actor Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan). However, he is calmed when they inform him that it is simply a routine procedure that NBC carries out for some of its more famous stars. Kenneth decides to show the obituary to Tracy himself, who, far from being pleased, laments the way that his legacy looks on television and declares that he does not want to be remembered the way he is.

Eventually, Avery realizes that there is nothing untoward about Jack's friendship with Liz and reunites the pair, saying that they both need the relationship.

However, this plan goes wrong when Tracy hears that his film Hard To Watch is likely to win him an Oscar and becomes distracted, partially because of the news, and partially because he suddenly remembers that he left his son in Atlantic City.

Japanese aircraft bomb the town, so Jones drives toward Shanghai with his partner, Johnny Sparrow (William Bendix), who has acquired a newly orphaned baby boy. After nightfall, they are forced to stop because Chinese refugees crowd the road. The Chinese beat the Americans and start to take their truck, until Carolyn Grant (Loretta Young), an American schoolteacher born in China, tells them to stop. Carolyn sneaks her group of female college students into the back of Jones's truck. As she grew up there and knows the terrain, Carolyn takes over the driving for a while, and has her friend, Lin Wei, sit on the hood to watch for potholes. When Jones realizes that Carolyn has loaded his truck with refugees, he starts throwing them out (worried he will not have enough gas to get to Shanghai), but relents when he learns that they are Carolyn's students, all young women. The next day, they encounter Lin Wei's first and second brothers, Lin Cho and Lin Yun, who have formed a guerrilla band and are posing as peasants. Lin Cho warns them to take an alternate road as the Japanese are approaching. Jones reluctantly drives to the family farm of Tan Ying, a girl he tried to throw off the truck, as \"Donald Duck\" (the baby) needs milk. At the farm, Carolyn tries again to persuade Jones to take the students to Chungtu, where they can continue their studies, rather than Japanese-occupied Shanghai, but Jones refuses. After Johnny leaves the baby with Tan Ying's family for safekeeping, the journey resumes. They are forced to abandon the truck when Japanese aircraft strafe the road, but Lin Cho and his compatriots shoot the airplane down. When Carolyn discovers that Tan Ying has slipped off the bus to rejoin her family, she insists on returning for her. While the rest of the group hikes to a monastery, Jones and Carolyn drive back to the farm and are shocked to find that the Japanese have burned the farm, and murdered Tan Ying's parents and Donald Duck. Jones then finds three Japanese soldiers raping Tan Ying, and shoots them without hesitation, while Carolyn comforts the hysterical woman. After the group takes refuge in the monastery, Tan Ying dies. Finally cognizant of the nature of the Chinese struggle, Jones is now inspired to join the fight against the Japanese, and offers his help to the three brothers. They determine that they must close a mountain pass in order to prevent the further onslaught of the Japanese, but only the Japanese army has the necessary dynamite. That night, Jones, Johnny, Lin Wei, Lin Cho and Lin Yun swim across a river to raid a Japanese encampment and steal the dynamite. When their presence is detected, a fierce gun battle ensues, during which Lin Wei, and all but two other guerrillas, are killed. Before he dies, Lin Wei honors Jones by calling him his \"fourth brother.\" That night, Carolyn rejects Johnny's marriage proposal because she is in love with Jones, and later, the new lovers Jones and Carolyn spend a final night together. The next day, the small band of fighters places the dynamite along the mountain pass road. When the Japanese convoy appears early, Jones stops them on the road to give the guerrillas time to lay the dynamite, and pretends that he is stranded. The Japanese general explains to Jones that Japan has just bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States, and that their intention is to create a new world order. After the general's second-in-command shoots Jones, the Chinese set off the dynamite causing an avalanche that buries the Japanese troops, and closes the road. Carolyn and Johnny mourn the loss of their friend as they drive the students to Chungtu."

He finally picks on Skinner to obtain his invitation. Skinner and Honey's social triumph comes when they teach the jazzy steps of the Charleston to the village \"society swells,\" and soon an odd assortment of human beings of all shapes, types, and sizes are lined up trying bravely to master the intricacies of this peppy dance. Before the evening is over, Skinner has landed the big Johnson contract. The next morning his ex-bosses are camping on Skinner's trail begging him to come back as a partner in the firm, and he pretends that he must give his bosses' offer due deliberation."

        "content": "17-year-old aspiring singer, Katie Gibbs (Lucy Hale), is over-worked, bullied, and constantly harassed by her stepfamily, the Van Ravensways \u2014 shallow stepmother Gail (Missi Pyle), bratty teenage stepsister Beverly \"Bev\" (Megan Park), and younger troublemaking stepbrother Victor (Matthew Lintz). Despite how badly they treat her, Katie does their bidding with no complaints in fear that they might put her into foster care. Katie's parents died prior to the events of the movie. In a dream, Katie performs a music video for her hit single (\"Run This Town\"). Then Victor wakes her up, demanding breakfast. At the Wellesley Academy of the Arts, of which Gail is headmistress, Guy Morgan (Dikran Tulaine) \u2014 English president of Kensington Records, enrolls his son, Luke (Freddie Stroma). Katie, wanting to change her life for the better, sneaks her demo CD into Guy's briefcase. Guy wants Luke to produce an upcoming showcase at the Academy; Luke, however, is less than excited about following in his dad's footsteps. Back at home, Bev wants to win a recording contract with Guy: Bev, however, is a terrible singer; the more she practices, the worse she sounds. Guy calls Gail on Katie's cell phone, who is shocked to hear that he loves Katie's demo (\"Bless Myself\"). Gail lies, claiming it was Bev's demo and that Katie stole it. Meanwhile, Victor steals Katie's clothes and towel while she showers, and locks her out of the house, naked. Unable to get back inside, Katie trips over a visiting Luke; thinking fast, she covers herself up using the WELCOME mat. Amused by the situation, Luke gives her his jacket. While Bev welcomes Luke, Gail barges into Katie's room and forces her to sing. Then, after shoving Luke out of the house, Gail plans to get Bev a record deal by using Katie's voice. Bev is reluctant, but goes along with this in order to win Luke's affections. At school, Katie and her best friend, aspiring dancer Angela (Jessalyn Wanlim), hear Luke singing in the music room with his best friend, Mickey O'Malley, (\"Knockin\"). The entranced Katie writes a song of her own for him and admits that she likes him. Angela urges Katie to sing for him at the Bollywood Ball that night, and gives her a costume to wear. Then Gail barges in, forcing Angela to hide. Gail orders her stepdaughter to babysit Victor tonight, since she wants Bev to win Luke over at the Ball. Katie pleads with Ravi (Manu Narayan), Gail's guru (who is no real guru but just a half-Italian/half-Indian method actor and former KFC worker from New Jersey, named Tony Gupta, who needed the work) to watch Victor while she goes to the Ball. There Katie leads Luke outside and sings (\"Extra Ordinary\"). He is entranced by her voice. Angela distracts and challenges Gail to a Bollywood dance-off (\"Oh Mere Dilruba\"). Gail loses and then leaves the Ball. Katie tries to beat her stepmother home, but with no success. Now it's Katie's turn to get blackmailed: Gail vows to expel Angela from the Academy, which will ruin her chances of getting into Juilliard \u2014 unless Katie sings for Bev. To save Angela's dance career, Katie goes along with Gail's plot. Gail informs Katie that she's grounded for disobeying her and going to the Ball. Luke wants to find the girl who sang for him, despite Ms. Dorothy Plumberg the assistant principal trying to punish him with detention and being chased by a crazy girl. In the music room, he sees Bev lip-syncing to Katie's voice (\"Make You Believe\"). Jumping to the obvious-but-wrong conclusion, Luke falls for Bev and invites her to write more songs with him. Much to Bev's horror, he treats her out to a restaurant that evening. Luke is amazed by Bev's musical aptitude, unaware that Katie is texting to her what she should say (because Bev forced her to help), but ends in disaster. The next day, Luke drops by the house and hits it off with Victor, to whom he gives guitar lessons. Katie also reconnects with Luke, who doesn't like it when she has to head out again \u2014 this time, to throw away Gail's prized portrait that French painter, Maurice, was doing for her, which Victor has ruined by cutting out her face with his mother's Ghandi knife. Bev cuts in on Luke, whom she then forces her brother to help her deceive by using miniature electronic-communication devices, so that Katie can coach her through another date. Katie puts together a song on the spot (\"Possibilities\"), which Luke sings, thinking it's Bev's. She and Luke kiss, which breaks Katie's heart. Luke falls in love with Bev, unaware that her singing and songwriting talents are actually Katie's. Later, to ensure Katie's cooperation, Gail reveals that she has discovered a loophole that allows her access to the savings account Katie's late father had opened for his daughter; ergo, if Katie doesn't submit to her stepfamily's will, Gail will cut her off without a cent. Victor overhears, learning in the process that his family's money is rightfully Katie's. As it turns out, Victor himself is frequently mistreated by his sister and their mom; he shares no more affection with them than Katie does, and he only went along with their mistreatment of Katie because he was fearful of what they would do to him if he didn't. Feeling guilty over not having had a better relationship with his stepsister over the years \u2014 among other things, she's the only one who remembers his birthday \u2014 Victor agrees to help expose the fraud perpetrated by his family. At the showcase, Victor sabotages Bev's performance (of \"Make You Believe\") by destroying her iPhone which contains Katie's recorded singing voice, to Gail's anger, and Katie and Bev's worry. Frantically trying to cover up the situation by telling the audience that her mic has stopped working, Bev receives booing onstage from the audience. Gail, refusing to give up, forces Katie to sing live backstage. Curious, Luke goes backstage to see what's happening; and he sees Katie. At first, he is confused as Katie tries to get him to leave, but she soon admits to Luke that Bev can't sing. He realizes at last that Bev is a fake and that beautiful voice is actually Katie's. During Bev's second performance, Luke steals a video camera and films Katie singing backstage, thus exposing the whole charade. At the same time, Angela pushes Katie onto the stage to finish the song, much to Bev's humiliation as she runs off. The audience and Luke persuade Katie onstage to perform her demo (\"Bless Myself\"). Katie and Luke admit their feelings for each other and kiss and embrace. Guy also loves Katie's performance, and green-lights Luke to produce an album for her, which is for Kensington Records. He even agrees to help Angela get into Juilliard. In a mid-credits scene, Gail weakly attempts to appeal to Guy, but having had enough of her lies, he decides to tell the school board of her deceit and fraud, causing her to be removed as headmistress of Wellesley Academy. To Gail's surprise, even Bev is delighted to be rid of her mother, being no stranger herself to Gail's manipulative ways. Gail soon finds herself back to where she started decades before: singing (horribly) at a ranch, where she is bombarded with fruit and booed off the stage."

Directed and written by debutante Hakim Rawther, it is jointly produced by Sabitha Jayaraj (Green Dragon Movies) and Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC).

The film features cinematography by Saloo George, editing by Venugopal and artwork by Nathan Mannoor. The background score has been provided by Biju and songs featured in the film are composed by Shyam Sharman and Rajesh with lyrics written by Arumughan Vengidang.

The following morning, he finds a picture of a young woman on the ground just before a mortar attack destroys where he had been sitting, killing many around him. Unsuccessful at finding the photo's owner, he keeps it. Logan's squad-mate declares the woman in the picture as his \"guardian angel,\" just before an explosion destroys their Humvee. Logan returns to Colorado to live with his sister's family, who have been looking after his dog, Zeus. Suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and survivor guilt, he decides it is best to leave and departs to search of the woman in the photo. Logan and Zeus walk to Louisiana, where a lighthouse in the picture has provided a clue. He shows the photo around town and a local resident tells him that the woman used to be married to his friend, a local deputy sheriff. Logan finds the woman, Beth Green (Taylor Schilling), but has difficulty explaining why he is there. She assumes he wants a job, and her grandmother, Ellie (Blythe Danner) hires him. At first, Beth is irritated by Logan's presence, but she begins to warm to him as his calm demeanor, willingness to work, and competence in repairing machinery are demonstrated. Logan develops a supportive relationship with Beth's son, Ben, who is without a positive male influence since the death of Beth's brother, Drake. Beth's former husband, Sheriff's Deputy Keith Clayton (Jay R. Ferguson)\u2014the son of the town's judge\u2014is immediately suspicious of Logan. He is brusque and overbearing with the former Marine. He discourages Ben from playing the violin around him, leading to Ben practicing in his tree house. When Ben returns bloodied from a charity baseball game, Beth and Keith have an argument, and he threatens to use his connections to take full custody of Ben. She is anxious about Keith's short temper and is fearful of losing her son to him. On the anniversary of Drake's death, Beth becomes distraught and Logan calms her down. Keith tries to stop the budding relationship between Beth and Logan, but Beth stands up to Keith, showing that she is not intimidated by him anymore. Keith learns that Logan was asking about her when he first arrived in town and steals the photo, telling Beth that Logan has been stalking her. Her trust destroyed, she is distraught and sends Logan away. Ellie tries to soften Beth, explaining to her that it isn't Logan's fault he survived and Drake did not. An intoxicated Keith sees Logan walking with his dog and angrily confronts him, drawing his gun while people on the street begin to panic and run. Logan disarms him, turning the weapon over to another officer. He then heads home to pack, finding a photo of Beth's brother, Drake, inside a book Ben had given him. The tattoo on Drake's forearm says \"Aces\" and he realizes that Drake was the sergeant from the night raid. He returns to Beth's house to tell her what he knows of how Drake died. At Judge Clayton's, Keith is shocked and embarrassed over what he did though his father tells him it will all blow over before the election. Keith walks out into a gathering storm, leaving his badge behind, and goes to Beth to plead for reconciliation. When she gently but firmly refuses, he threatens to take Ben away. Ben overhears and runs out into the storm, followed by Keith and Beth, just as Logan arrives. Ellie urges Logan to follow. Ben is en route to the treehouse, but the rope bridge gives way and he falls into the river along with his father, just as Beth and Logan arrive. Keith, caught in the rope of the bridge, calls to Logan who grabs Ben and hands him to Beth. Before Logan can return for Keith, the treehouse falls on him and he is swept away in the raging river to his death. Back home, Beth thanks Logan for saving her son. Logan explains that Drake died saving one of his own men. He starts to leave, but Beth runs after him and says that he belongs with them. Later, Logan, Beth, Zeus, and Ben celebrate Ben's 9th birthday together."

They are later released from jail and immediately contacted by the local pimp gangster, Tap Manson, who wants them to work as hostesses for a company called \"House by the side of the road, Inc.\". It is a franchise of motels by the highway roadsides. Head of the company is Mrs. Burke, an old, hardened gangster of a woman who has a deceivingly kind appearance. At first the sisters try to find other jobs, but their search leads nowhere. Eventually they meet with Mrs. Burke and gets hired as hostesses at House 42, one of the motels that is located somewhere in the Midwest. Manson takes them there, together with three other unfortunate girls. Their job is to walk along the highway, pretend to be hitchhikers and lure the drivers in to the combined motel, bar and restaurant. Jane manages to get a ride with Rocky Stone, who understands about the hitchhiking scam but agrees to take Jane anyway. Upon Rocky's arrival to the motel, Manson learns that he has jewels worth $60,000 in his car, and steals them. Rocky believes Jane has taken the jewels and confronts her. After the confrontation, Jane is called in to Mrs. Burke for questioning, and because she doesn't leave the desired answers, she is beaten by the mean old lady. When Edie finds out about her sister's misfortune she decides to take her vengeance on Manson, who tricked them into working at the motel. Unfortunately her plan is overheard by one of the other girls, Rhoda, who reports to Manson. Edie is run over by Manson in his car. Jane is devastated over her sister's death and turns to Rocky for help. They get Manson to admit he killed Edie and confess to the racket Mrs. Burke is running. The two gangsters are then convicted of their crimes in a court of law, and Rocky takes care of Jane, who he has grown fond of."

The second section is Woman of Sin, a send-up of Hollywood greed. Actor's Blood takes place in New York City. Broadway star Marcia Tillayou has been found shot dead in her apartment. Her father Maurice is himself an actor, and had watched her theater career rise as his own declined. She had let success overcome her, and had thus alienated critics, fans, producers and her playwright husband. She had a few recent stage flops before being murdered. Woman of Sin takes place in Hollywood. Dishonest writers' agent Orlando Higgens has been receiving frantic calls from Daisy Marcher about a screenplay that she had written titled Woman of Sin. Thinking they are crank calls, Higgens tells her to never again call his office. He then learns that because of a mail mixup, her screenplay had been received by film mogul J.B. Cobb, a man who had once passed on Gone With the Wind based on Higgins' advice. Cobb thinks that Higgins sent the script and offers him a lucrative sum for the rights. However, Higgins does not know where Daisy is or that she is actually a nine-year-old child."

        "content": "In a contemporary review for The New York Times, critic Howard Thompson characterized the film as \"an almost reverential close-up of a stage actor's senile egomania and an atomically conceived blast at front-office intellectuality in the film factories.\" Thompson called Actor's Blood a \"stiff, glum and narcissistic tale ... the whole episode flounders midway between a conversational seance and a straight farce\" and Woman of Sin \"straight farce, with an idea so devastatingly impudent that only Mr. Hecht could claim it.\" In reference to the film's two sections, DVD Talk writes \"Both are light, breezy, and inconsequential, though admittedly written with an expert's ear for dialogue and a knack for clever story twists.\" They write that both sections \"move at an efficient pace\", and praise Ben Hecht for the dialog and rhythm of his scripts. They also note that the actors were well chosen, finding flaw only in the child actors used in the Woman of Sin segment. They did have critique about the material itself, noting that while Hecht knew his way around both Hollywood and Broadway, the subject matter comes off as a little \"too inside\". They were also disappointed in the two stories, finding the plotlines \"fairly hokey and predictable\". However, and despite the \"hackneyed narrative\", they found the film overall to be \"very watchable\", in that Hecht's sense of timing kept the project from being boring. DVD Verdict wrote that \"the most intriguing element\" of the film, and not properly promoted by the film's trailer, is that \"it is actually two brief films combined in one package.\" In analyzing Actor's Blood, they wrote that there was \"an opportunity for insight and depth in this story, but it would seem that Mr. Hecht wrote the screenplay while in a blind rage.\" They offered that the material might even have been comedic but for it being \"preposterously heavy-handed\". They felt that the actors generally spoke each line over-dramatically and floundered, with only Edward G. Robinson \"able to make this work within the context of his character\". In their analysis of Woman of Sin, they found it to be \"reasonably engaging early on as a breezy satire\", despite the concept of a story written by a nine-year-old \"earning words of praise and adoration from the likes of Jack Warner and Louis B. Mayer\". They noted that the cameos by the studio heads were amusing, but that the story was derailed by the use of Ben Hecht's daughter Jenny in the role of child screenwriter Daisy Marcher. They felt that she was \"fingernails-on-a-blackboard grating\" in this role, in that she \"dials up every aspect of precociousness that can afflict a child actor as high as it can possibly go, and her presence effectively destroys any sense of comic momentum that the film had built up to that point,\" making her use a clear example of the problems inherent in nepotism. They concluded that the film would stand as \"an interesting curiosity for Hollywood history buffs, but fails as a cinematic experience.\""

He is furious when Ike Broflovski, who is supposed to portray tooth decay, misses a rehearsal to watch the Canadian royal wedding. During the ceremony, the princess is suddenly enclosed in a giant cube and spirited away. Ike is so distraught that he cannot stop crying during rehearsal and gets sent home by Mr. Mackey. People all over Canada commit mass suicide of despair for the princess' abduction and a candlelight vigil is held where Rush performs a version of Candle in the Wind. The Prime Minister of Canada instructs all people of Canadian descent to go home and open their \"Box of Faith\", which contains \u2013 along with a location beacon, a first aid kit, and a sandwich \u2013 a video recording issuing a call to arms for all Canadians in fighting condition to \"meet by the tree in Edmonton\". Ike answers the call and, while riding a bus to Canada, meets a fellow Canadian named Ugly Bob, who claims he has to wear a bag over his head because, even though he simply appears Canadian to Americans, other Canadians find his face frighteningly ugly. Once the pair arrive, the first instinct of the member of the Canadian Armed Forces leading the gathered Canadians is that the princess was taken by a giant, who turns out to be Scott the Dick, who grew to seven feet tall \u2013 giant by Canadian standards \u2013 after a radioactive accident in Ottawa. When it turns out that Scott has been wrongly accused of taking the princess, most other Canadians go home, but Scott persuades Ike and Ugly Bob to follow him as he accuses the Inuit of kidnapping the princess out of his racial prejudice towards the \"Native Canadians\". The three of them travel to the Arctic tundra of the Yukon Territory to get information from the Inuit, who admit that their people do have a grudge against the Canadians for taking their land, but tribe leader reveals that the princess' abduction was foretold, and that the true kidnapper is one who attacks people of all nationalities. With an Inuit mother leading the three, they find a large dark castle, where the princess is held captive by the abductor: Tooth Decay. Eventually, after the monster hurls Scott and the Inuit woman across the room, Ike turns Tooth Decay to stone by exposing Ugly Bob's face to him. Meanwhile, Mr. Mackey becomes an increasingly irate person with Ike's absence and blames it on Kyle Broflovski, who fills Ike's role in the play. During rehearsals Mackey consistently loses his temper with the children for singing flat or without feeling, directing his most scathing remarks at Kyle, and reveals that the play means a great deal to him because Tooth Decay killed his father. While the play is a success with parents of the kindergartners, Mr. Mackey verbally abuses his actors' imperfections backstage until the police intervene, telling Mackey to cancel the play due to reports coming in that Tooth Decay is dead. Ike receives a knighthood from the Canadian princess, an honor that fails to impress any of the boys (with the exception of Kyle), and the royal wedding begins again. Both events (before and after the princess' abduction) involve bizarre traditions such as the prince putting his arms into a large bowl of butterscotch pudding, the princess scraping them clean and smearing the pudding on her own face, and the prince tearing one of her arms off and inserting it into his anus, \"as is tradition.\""

Instantly, they feel drawn toward one other and eventually fall in love. The movie opens in two places - following the two protagonists - first, within a church, where Elena's son, Nash, refuses to support an anti-homosexual protest, and then within a memorial service for Peyton's mother. Elena and her husband Barry (Gary Weeks) are trying to conceive but it becomes clear that their efforts have been unsuccessful when Barry rebukes Elena after her period starts. Peyton starts cleaning out her mother's things, having flashbacks of her emotionally troubled mother as she works. Peyton finds a tape entitled 'Women's Glory Project' with her things, and becomes obsessed with it for some time. Elena visits her friend Tyler for advice, telling him that she and Barry are going to adopt instead of trying to have another child. He asks \"what's in it for (her),\" and insists (as he's apparently done in the past) that Barry is not her soulmate, or \"twin flame.\" Even so, he pushes her to go to the adoption, saying that \"someone is definitely coming into (her) life, in a big way.\" Peyton and Elena meet at the adoption agency. They briefly speak as Peyton returns Elena's lost keys to her. They exchange business cards after Peyton mentions that she might have use for a photographer (which Elena was prior to marrying Barry). Peyton's best friend, Wave, drags her to a 'love guru' (Tyler) where Peyton and Elena meet once again. Elena finds out that Peyton is gay as they talk about their marriages. Peyton calls Elena the next day, inquiring if Elena would help her with continuing her mother's Women's Glory Project, and make plans for Elena to visit the next day with her portfolio. They meet once again, and it's revealed that Peyton's an agoraphobic with substantial difficulties trusting. They bond over the next few weeks - over picnics with Tyler, and late-night glasses of wine. Later, Elena takes better professional photographs of Peyton for her books, and they discuss their upbringings and how they knew they were straight and gay, respectively. Peyton calls Wave asking for advice on her feelings for Elena, and her friend tells her to be honest with Elena about said feelings, unaware that Elena has some of her own. She visits Peyton later, after being avoided for some time, showing up at her door with the printed photographs. At the unexpected visit, Peyton discloses her feelings to Elena and suggests that they not spend time together. Elena violently rejects that idea, telling Peyton that she's her absolute best friend, that they need to be in each other's lives, and that Peyton can have \"all of (her) except for that (meaning physically romantic encounters).\" Subsequently, however, Elena begins to rapidly examine her own feelings. Elena calls Peyton after exploring lesbian websites, saying that she's not attracted to them and doesn't think she's a lesbian, leaving the viewer aware that she is attracted to Peyton. This is followed by an uncharacteristically (up to this point) passionate statement from Elena asking if she and Peyton could agree to call her feelings a serious \"crush.\" Her husband walks up in the middle of the call, causing her to quickly end it, which appears even more suspicious. The following day, Elena comes over to Peyton's house and makes out with her passionately. As time passes, Elena begins wanting more from her relationship with Peyton. She asks Peyton to make love to her; at first Peyton refuses, saying that \"once [they] go there, there's no going back.\" Elena tells her that she doesn't want to go back. As they're making love, Peyton asks Elena to stay with her, though it's unclear whether she means physically or emotionally. Over the next several days, Elena and Peyton embark on a secret sexual relationship. One morning, they both get into a bit of an inquisition when Peyton asks how Barry comes on to Elena and when and how often they have sex. Elena tells her that they don't have sex anymore, and also tells her that they're going on an annual vacation to Hawaii together. Peyton writes intimate letters to Elena as she's away, and Nash is the one that finds them as he's looking for some aspirin in her suitcase. The toll of having two partners starts to eat away at Elena, and she begins to get in more fights with both Barry and Peyton. Nash starts stealing and drinking from the stress of keeping Elena's affair with Peyton secret, and ends up getting caught by the police after getting drunk and returning to the store he stole from. When Elena comes back and confronts him about it, he tells her that he knows of her affair with Peyton and she explains (briefly) that she does not intend to stop seeing her. Elena returns to Tyler out of desperation for answers as to why she's been set on this path, and meets Peyton later and kisses her in the park, oblivious to Millie seeing them together. Millie then calls Barry and tells him about Elena's affair. Peyton tells her that they should probably break up, because of all the complications arising for Elena. Elena insists that they don't, asking Peyton rhetorically if she ever saw a future of them together. They break up and Elena walks off as Millie goes to Barry and tells him about the affair to his face. Elena breaks up with Barry, telling him that Nash needs the real them, not the fighting couple that they've become. Six months later, Wave and Peyton are taking a walk in the park and run into Tori and Nash, also doing the same. Elena also comes up, walking with Tyler and his wife, Lily. She's now pregnant, and at first Peyton freaks out, thinking that Elena played her and was sleeping with Barry the entire time they were together. Elena faints, and Nash gets Peyton and Elena to talk together at Tyler's house so Elena can explain that she broke up and is getting divorced from Barry, but still wanted a child, to have some hope in her life and that she received IVF with Tyler's 'contribution,' and asks Peyton to try and understand. Peyton apologizes and they kiss. The movie ends with another of Tyler's picnics with Peyton and Elena together with their infant."

        "content": "In the opening scene, young children tell their versions of the invasion. They draw pictures of their families, kids with harnesses and the alien airships. Tom Mason's (Noah Wyle) son, Matt, tells Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) that his mother died during the attacks and his older brother, Ben, was kidnapped. He then shows her a picture of his father and oldest brother, Hal (Drew Roy). Matt informs Anne that they are fighting. In a dark street, Tom and Hal look for food. They grab a food kart, but are ambushed by robotic aliens, known as \"Mechs\", which destroy the food. As Tom and Hal run away, soldiers fire guns at the aliens behind barricades. The aliens destroy the barricade and kill the soldiers. Tom and Hal hide in an empty store. They exit, finding Captain Weaver (Will Patton) and other soldiers armed with guns. An airship flies overhead and fires, causing a bright light to consume the atmosphere around them. The group runs away back to their base. Upon arrival, Tom sees his son Matt asleep and picks him up. He talks to his friend, Anne who tells him about his son's drawings. Tom is then called by Col. Porter (Dale Dye) for a meeting. There, Porter discusses his plan to leave the city and break off into groups. The alien air ships can detect groups of humans over 600 persons so he splits his brigade into smaller groups consisting of 100 fighters and 200 civilians. He puts Weaver in charge of the 2nd Mass and Tom as his second-in-command. The following day, the fighters and civilians begin to move. They search for food in stores but find none. Weaver tells Tom that they can't go back looking for more food as the numbers are too large. Tom volunteers to go back. Weaver gives him six fighters and a pickup truck. Hal, Karen, Dai, Anthony, Click and Jimmy join Tom in the hunt for food. Hal and Karen leave the group to search for aliens. Hal sees Mechs and harnessed kids with them. It is there that he sees his brother, Ben. He immediately returns to tell his father. They are both overjoyed, yet Tom insists that they stick with the mission at hand. Hal disagrees and tries to go and find his brother. Tom wrestles him to the ground and convinces him to do the job the \"right way\". The group finds a supply store with food and scout the area for aliens. Finding none, they load the food into the truck. Hal is attacked by a Skitter. Tom fires at it and his son runs away. A Mech is alerted and comes after Tom. Hal stops it by firing at it. It then runs after Hal. Tom puts C-4 in a shopping cart and wheels it next to the Mech, killing it. The Skitter comes after Tom, but Dai shoots it. The alien dies slowly after its gun wound and the group observes it before it dies. The six fighters return and Tom informs Weaver of their success. He then tells Weaver that he and Hal must go looking for Ben. Weaver declines and says they must raid the armory for weapons. Tom tells him after that, they will go and find him. Before the 2nd Mass leave the city, Hal gives his brother his birthday gift. The children of the 2nd Mass play with it as the adults watch. Weaver tells Tom it is time to leave and they all move out on foot."

        "title": "Live and Learn (Falling Skies)_Conception",
        "content": "Development officially began in 2009, when TNT announced that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project. Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who is best known for writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. \"I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [spin on the] spirit of '76. I came up \u2014 out of the blue one day \u2014 with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world,\" he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. \"I've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?\" he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies''' running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, \"It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [Laughs] They say write what you know, and with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories.\" While writing the pilot, Rodat dedicated a five-page montage to the alien invasion, but decided not to go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds. \"I wrote a few drafts of it and I looked at and say, 'Ay-yay-yay, I\u2019ve seen this before. There's no emotion to this. It feels like one of those montages,'\" he said. Rodat came up with the idea of having the children in the series \"harnessed by aliens\". \"When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [Spielberg] was the idea that adults are killed if they're a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we\u2019ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show but that also is something that's going to have to unveil itself gradually,\" he stated. Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Series lead Noah Wyle emphasized Spielberg's presence on set by stating \"Anytime he gives an anointment to a project, it steps up the pedigree.\" Colin Cunningham, who plays outlaw John Pope, exclaimed \"You'd show up and think, \u2018This is not a TV show; this is something else that we're doing,\u2019 \" he said, noting that Spielberg was very hands-on for the pilot. \"Its scope is massive. Anytime you hear the word Spielberg, you know it's not going to be crap; you know it\u2019ll be quality and there will be some money behind it.\" Mark Verheiden, who was the showrunner for the first season, stated \"It's great to know you have a world-class filmmaker backing up what you're trying to do who is supportive and helping design the great stuff.\""

One day a masked figure by the name of Valerio from Burgos arrives at the monastery with his godfather, explaining the mask as necessary due to terrible burns inflicted on him in a fire that killed his parents. He expresses a desire to join the monastery which is initially shunned by several of the monks, however Ambrosio convinces them to not fear his differences, and to accept him. Valerio later reveals to Ambrosio that he is actually a woman by the name of Matilda, and Ambrosio orders her to leave. As a last request she asks for a rose from his rose garden, and upon reaching in to pluck one for her, Ambrosio is bitten by a giant centipede. As he becomes delirious from the effects of the venom, he is seduced by Matilda and compromises his faith. Another lady, Antonia, who had recently heard him preach comes to the monastery to ask that Ambrosio see her sick mother. He complies and is told of a story by the sickly mother that she left a son named Mateo that was lost years ago and this troubles her soul. Driven by a carnal lust for Matilda, Ambrosio transgresses and he is soon found desiring the innocent Antonia now. He also sees apparitions of the pregnant nun he condemned to death by turning her over to the prioress. Matilda recognizes Ambrosio's new interest in the fair Antonia and uses magic spells to help the monk in his pursuit of her. She resists and her rape by him and discovery of her murdered mother (at the hand of Ambrosio) leads to her insanity. As her mother dies, she utters the word \"Mateo\", indicating that Ambrosio now knows that he is the older brother of Antonia. Returning to the monastery, Ambrosio is delivered to the Inquisition where he is condemned to death by starvation. He escapes only when Matilda, revealing herself as an instrument of Satan in female form, leads him to her master. The Devil offers Ambrosio an eternity of pleasure by selling his soul, but Ambrosio demands instead the deal to be used to save Antonia from madness. He then dies, without hope for himself, and is corpse is devoured by crows."

Clara Ferguson (Zoe Boyle) is no longer depressed, and urges Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), who has given her attentive care, to return home. Ferguson's depression returns again, when Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs her that she has an infection that requires surgery. She rejects the surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the worst-case scenario is that she will need an ostomy pouching system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).

Webber is taken to the neighboring Mercy West Hospital, where he is treated by former colleague Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and subsequently discharged.

The woolshed dance sequence was shot at a Pyrmont woolstore. One of Thunderbolt's robbery victims was played by Kathleen Drummond, daughter of the then-local MP David Drummond. British censorship requirements meant that the real-life romantic relationship between Thunderbolt and his aboriginal girlfriend Mary, who helped him escape from Cockatoo Island, was not featured in the film when released in Britain. According to Filmink \"Holmes was a bit of a lefty in real life, and he fashions the story so poor old Thunderbolt is a victim of the upper classes. Holmes was conservative enough, however, to remove Thunderbolt\u2019s aboriginal wife from the story entirely.\" Captain Thunderbolt was allowed to live at the end of the film because the producers hoped to spin it off into a TV series. This did not happen."

He presents the chief with a cane as a gift and symbol of their friendship. Lt. Hunt is promoted due to his personal assistance to Lincoln in arranging the truce. Unhappily, a bigoted superior officer, Col. McComb, and the dastardly Judge Wilcox are opposed to any such treaty. When Hunt states his objection, McComb has him placed under arrest alongside Acoma and a number of Indian braves, also breaking the cane. Other members of the tribe break them out of jail, killing McComb and others in the process. Hunt takes command and cancels all travel in the region, angering a woman named Cherry who is planning a trip to Nevada. She arrogantly elects to leave anyway, as does Judge Wilcox, so a company of men led by Hunt goes along as escort. The Indians attack, frightening the two women and burying the judge in the sand. Hunt is disgusted with Cherry's selfish attitude and tells her so. She comes to know one of Acoma's sons, and when another uprising has fatal consequence for the Indian warriors as well as Hunt, she and Acoma's son are lucky to have their lives spared."

Ryan lies about what he had seen, telling Marion (Patricia McDonald), Jamieson's daughter, who loves Marsden, that the young pilot was killed. Ryan was told to kill Marsden but tries to find a way to double cross the enemy agent. Deciding to press his advantage, Heinrich visits Jamieson, hoping to force the businessman to surrender his claim on the wolframite mineral.

Alike slowly and firmly comes to terms with her own identity as a butch lesbian, comfortable in baggy clothes and male underwear. Her mother Audrey approves of neither her clothes nor her friendship with Laura.  Harboring growing suspicions about Alike's sexuality, Audrey forces her to wear feminine clothing and tries to stem any influence from Laura by pushing Alike to instead make friends with Bina, a girl from her church. Alike has a better relationship with her father Arthur, who is a police detective. Alike begins to develop feelings for Bina, and starts spending more time with her than with Laura, much to Laura's annoyance. Arthur comes back late a few times from work, which angers Audrey and the two of them fight often. Arthur does not think much about the changes in Alike's life. Saying she is going through a phase, he is supportive of her, although he cautions her on steering clear of the area where there is a lesbian bar, saying it's not safe. One night after going to see an alternative rock band, Alike and Bina are alone in Bina's room when Bina begins caressing and kissing Alike.  Alike is at first hesitant, having had no prior experience with physical intimacy.  However, she eventually responds and the two spend the night together.  In the morning, Alike talks to Bina about where they want their relationship to go, but Bina says there is no relationship, as she is not \"really gay-gay\" and only regarded their physical encounter as playful indulgence.  Her only further interest in Alike seems to be her concern that Alike not tell anyone else about the two of them.  Hurt and upset, Alike leaves and returns home and cries for hours. During that time, Audrey and Arthur have an explosive fight about Alike. Despite her sister Sharonda's protests, Alike decides to intervene in the fight and she comes out to her parents. Disgusted, Audrey viciously attacks Alike while Arthur tries to restrain her. Alike flees to Laura's house where the two friends reconcile. Audrey then tries to forget that anything happened, which annoys the rest of her family. Arthur comes to meet with Alike, apologizes for Audrey's actions and requests that Alike come back home, offering half-hearted assurance that if she does, \"things will be different\".  Alike says that she will not return home, but instead plans to move to California to begin college early.  She assures her father that, \"I'm not running; I'm choosing.\" Before leaving, Alike makes an attempt to reconcile with her mother as well.  However, her mother refuses to accept her and offers only that she will be praying for Alike.  Arthur, Sharonda and Laura see Alike off on her journey west and the film ends with Alike reading a poem she wrote; its theme echoes her words to her father that she is not running, but choosing."

This is easily the most impressive, most gripping locally-made documentary yet screened here. Its message is the memory it leaves, more than its brief, indirect request for the support of the austerity loan. Mr. Chauvel has most effectively clothed propaganda with compelling drama. As it should, the film will make many uncomfortable. Every one of its thirteen minutes is vibrant with quiet domestic realism and the humorous and tragic notes of its brief, but very boiling, Libyan episode... The film has as its theme the routing of selfishness by the recogni-tion of sacrifice. Its implications cut deep, and the narrative, poignant and very convincing, will leave none un-moved, for the film has an emotional quality rare in Australian productions. Acted by some of our most natural screen players, it gives newcomer Noala Warren the leading role, which she plays with astonishing poise and ability."

One of the inmates, Joan Burton, has been illicitly having conjugal relations late at night with her husband, Glen, a convict in the other wing. Now she is expecting a baby, and brutal men's warden Brock issues a stern warning to Van Zandt that she'd better find out how the two prisoners have been arranging these meetings. Joan has the sympathy of the decent Dr. Crane who's in charge of the infirmary and disapproves of the cruel treatment of prisoners he sees. But the heartless Van Zandt goes into a literally homicidal rage while interrogating Joan, beating the pregnant prisoner to death. A protest erupts in the women's cell block, beginning with a hunger strike organized by Joan's cell mate, Brenda Martin, then turning into a full-scale riot. Naive or timid inmates are swept up along with the vicious, veteran ones, and there is much bloodshed before the uprising is quelled.

Ricky is unreliable, Max is immature and George is becoming distant as he builds a relationship with his girlfriend Lynn (Anna Skellern). In order to make ends meet, the three also work in the cafeteria of an asylum for the criminally insane along with William (Marcus Garvey). George is the head chef and puts effort into preparing high quality food and being courteous to the inmates. The inmates are generally docile due to the pills they take, but one inmate in particular named Harry Green (Richard Brake) creeps George out. One morning after a late-night rock show, an exhausted George has to come in early to work in a torrential downpour. Many bad omens occur, with the chicken meat still attached to the heads, George cutting himself, and later, he loses his temper at both his bandmates and Harry, who stares menacingly at him. George also thinks that he sees Harry convince a fellow inmate to spit out his pills. Max tells George to take a nap while he prepares dinner. A few hours later, however, an explosion is heard and Max wakes George up to tell him that the power has gone out in the building. Because the exterior doors are electronically locked, everyone is now trapped inside the building. Many of the inmates have already been brought into the dining room for dinner service and the head guard enlists George and William to help escort them back to their cells. Unknown to those in the kitchen, several other inmates have seized the opportunity to overtake and kill the prison guards and nurses on the other side of the building. George and William succeed in getting the inmates to their cells, but they see that the inmates are growing restless and the locks on all the doors are not working. When they return to the kitchen, they find the head guard has disappeared and Ricky and Max have barricaded themselves in the freezer. Suddenly, several inmates walk into the dining area and begin trying to break into the kitchen. Max, William, and George manage to sneak out of the kitchen after the inmates break in, but Ricky refuses to come with them and remains barricaded in the freezer. George sees Harry smiling at all of the mayhem, appearing to be the ringleader of the riots. The threesome run around the asylum, finding the head guard decapitated. They eventually make their way to the head guard's office and use the landline phone to call the police, but are told that the police will be unable to respond for at least an hour. Eventually, the prisoners capture Ricky and fatally impale him in front of George, Max, and William. At Harry's urging, the inmates storm the head guard office, although the cooks manage to kill all of the ones who attack however, Max's nose is bitten off in the struggle. The three flee back to the kitchen, but eventually George is knocked out and Max is captured. When George awakens, he is naked and tied to a table. George is forced to watch as inmates burn Max alive on the stove top. One inmate also begins mutilating George, though eventually George convinces him to leave him alone. George is finally confronted by Harry, who begins to gleefully eat his own fingers. George screams at Harry to end the madness to no avail. George hears police sirens and soon, William leads the police into the kitchen, but Harry has disappeared. As the medics begin wheeling George out of the asylum, he looks over to see the corpse of Harry, with all his fingers intact, apparently having been killed at the very beginning of the riot. Apparently, George has hallucinated Harry's presence throughout the night. The film jumps ahead to focus on George in a bed while Lynn cries at his side. George has a vacant expression, having seemingly been driven mad by his experience. The camera zooms into George's mind where he is still working in the cafeteria with his bandmates, and the inmates are still on the loose."

Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named This Is Not A Film the sixth-best film of 2012, calling it an \"extraordinarily egoless self-profile\" and \"protest art at its peak.\" Sight & Sound placed it eighth on its list of the best films of 2012. Calling This Is Not A Film one of the top 10 movies of 2012, critic Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said it \"uses Brechtian staging, blurred lines between documentary and drama, and an iPhone to explore the notion of physical and political boundaries, the aesthetic and technological contours of cinema, and the enduring power of self-expression.\" Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times rated This Is Not a Film the fourth best documentary of 2012, calling it a \"brave and witty video diary, an essay on the struggle between political tyranny and the creative imagination.\" Peter Debruge of Variety called the film \"a courageous act of nonviolent protest.\" Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"an unusual documentary\" that finds a creative solution to Panahi's ban on filmmaking. Jacques Mandelbaum of Le Monde wrote that the film shows audiences Panahi's courage and dignity. In December 2012 it was shortlisted as one of 15 films eligible for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards."

        "content": "In the series premiere, Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) returns to the Hamptons, where she and her father (James Tupper) spent each summer before his arrest. She rents the house she once shared with her late father, now owned by Lydia Davis (Amber Valletta). When Emily begins to put her plan for revenge into action, she gets sidetracked by an old friend, a potential new romance, and an unwanted ally. She soon starts to learn everyone's hidden secrets, and makes it her goal to get revenge on those who destroyed her family. The series starts with a man being shot, and falling lifelessly onto the beach while a party is going on in the background. The party celebrates Emily's engagement to Daniel Grayson (Joshua Bowman). Two more shots are fired into the man's back, but no one at the party can hear the shots, because fireworks are going off. Emily is seen in an elegant red dress wiping sand off her hand. She informs the party planner, her friend Ashley (Ashley Madekwe), that Daniel is walking the beach because they had an argument. Daniel's mother, Victoria (Madeleine Stowe), makes a passionate speech about Emily and her engagement to Daniel. She then privately demands that Emily tell her of her son's whereabouts. Declan (Connor Paolo) and Charlotte (Christa B. Allen), Daniel's sister, find who they presume to be Daniel, dead on the beach. The scene then flashes back to five months earlier. Emily has returned to the Hamptons and is renting the beach house she once shared with her father, David Clarke. Emily's realtor says that the beach house now belongs to Lydia and Michael Davis, who are currently in a divorce. Michael left Lydia for a woman half Lydia's age, the realtor adds. Emily looks out at the water and sees a carving in the porch ledge. She recognizes it as double infinity, and flashes back to when she and her father played on the porch with sand. Her father tells her that he loves her \"infinity\", drawing the infinity symbol in the sand, \"times infinity\", drawing the symbol again so it interlocks with the first. The realtor also points out that the Graysons live next door, and Emily says she'll take the house. As Emily is moving in, Victoria's son, Daniel, comes home from Harvard Business School, and his sister, Charlotte, strikes up a relationship with Jack Porter's (Nick Wechsler) brother, Declan, at their tavern. Nolan Ross (Gabriel Mann) meets up with Jack and offers to buy his boat named \"Amanda\" for a large sum. Jack refuses because he is sailing to Haiti in a week to help with the earthquake. A bank representative comes by the tavern owned by Jack and Declan's father (Brian Goodman) to tell him that the bank will foreclose on the tavern if the loan is not paid off by the end of the month. Victoria announces that she will host a charity event on her large boat and will auction a piece of art from her private collection. She chooses to auction off a Manet painting instead of a van Gogh, because her best friend Lydia gave her the van Gogh. Lydia reveals quietly to Victoria that her ex-husband is threatening to put the beach house on the market. Lydia runs into Emily on the beach, and Emily tells her that she is renting the beach house that Lydia and her husband shared. Lydia officially welcomes Emily to the Hamptons. Emily has flashbacks when she watches a video of a trial in 1995 that shows Lydia, her father's administrator, testifying falsely against her father. David was falsely accused of being responsible for the crash of Flight 197. Emily remembers her father being arrested by FBI agents when she was young, after which she was removed from her father's care. Emily secretly takes pictures of Lydia having an affair with Victoria's husband, Conrad (Henry Czerny). She goes to the South Fork Inn, where Conrad and Lydia have secretly chosen to meet, and they have a sexual affair. After sleeping with Lydia and eating soup, Conrad has painful stomach pains and is in need of medical attention. As he is rushed to the hospital, Emily asks Lydia if Conrad is her husband and offers her a ride to the hospital. Lydia declines and flees the scene. Emily then runs into Jack Porter and his dog Sammy. She recognizes Jack, and leaves in a rush. Victoria rushes to the hospital thinking that Conrad is in a serious condition. The hospital tells Victoria that Conrad should not eat spicy things at the South Fork Inn, because they upset his stomach. Victoria questions this; she thought that Conrad had gone golfing, but the South Fork Inn is 30 minutes in the opposite direction from the golf course. Victoria then notices a South Fork Inn robe in the hospital bed and fiercely says \"Don't do it again\" to her husband's face. Emily attends the Memorial Day charity party hosted by Victoria, and her friend, the party planner Ashley, introduces Emily to Victoria. Emily mentions her meeting with Conrad and Lydia at the South Fork Inn, the previous day, in front of Victoria. Victoria realizes that Lydia is sleeping with her husband. Victoria then makes a beautiful speech and lets the crowd know that Lydia has won the art auction. However, Victoria sends Lydia home with the van Gogh \"as a reminder of the friendship they shared.\" Emily strikes up a romance with Daniel and flirts with him throughout the rest of the party. Nolan Ross, who was at the charity party recording the entire event, recognizes Emily Thorne as Amanda Clarke. He goes to her house and offers to help her seek vengeance on the people who destroyed her and her father's lives. She refuses his help and says that Amanda Clarke no longer exists. Emily then flashes back to her 18th birthday when Nolan came to pick her up from a detention center. He told Amanda that her father had died, and that he had been falsely accused and did not have anything to do with the crash of Flight 197. Nolan also said that her father was the only person who invested in his company in its early stages, and now that she is 18 years old she is officially a 49% owner of his company. Nolan hands her a box, with the double infinity mark carved on the top, that her father left for her and a diary he wrote. Emily's father, in his letters and diaries, asks her to forgive those who wronged her and live a life full of happiness. However, she refuses and chooses to take revenge on those who destroyed her family. Victoria confronts Conrad about the affair, and he says that he gave up everything once to show how much he cared about her. Victoria rebukes him, saying that she returned the favor and destroyed a man, but Conrad says that that was all her idea. Emily goes out to the boat deck of the beach house and holds a watch she found in the box that reads, \"David, until forever, Victoria.\" Victoria watches Emily from her balcony, then calls her husband's head of security to investigate Emily Thorne. A flashback reveals that Emily posed as a maid at the South Fork Inn earlier and poured a small amount of an unknown clear liquid into Conrad's soup, causing him to end up in the hospital."

        "content": "Another part of Emily's (Emily VanCamp) plan is set in motion when she goes on her first date with Daniel (Josh Bowman). Also, Victoria's (Madeleine Stowe) suspicions about Emily grow, so she tries to find more information on her new neighbor. Emily goes to the polo match and meets Bill Harmon (Matthew Glave), head of a successful investing firm. She says that she has put up a huge offer for the beach house she is currently renting.  Daniel offers her a date if he wins the polo match. Victoria meets up with her husband's head of security, who informs her of Emily's wealthy past. Emily has a flashback of the birthday her father gave her a dog, which Emily names Sammy. Emily remembers Bill coming by on her birthday to see her and her father.  Bill gives some bad news about a deal that has gone wrong between Bill and her father (James Tupper), and says that Conrad (Henry Czerny) will have the final say. Back to the present, Emily meets Bill in his office, and he shows her the list of his top investors and how much profit she can gain from investing with him.  Emily asks Bill for a copy of the top-investors list, but Bill refuses.  As Emily leaves, she gets a call from her realtor and learns that the beach house has been sold to someone else.  Emily meets up with Nolan Ross (Gabriel Mann) and demands the house from him.  Nolan explains that if he did not place a bid on the beach house, Victoria would have won, because she outbid Emily.  Nolan says that the deed of the house is in Emily's name, as a birthday gift for \"Amanda\". He wishes to help her in her quest, since her father had helped back his company and make him a success, and Nolan wants to repay the debt. One night, during Emily's investigation of Bill Harmon's false testimony against her father (Bill said that her father had given money to the terrorists responsible for the attacks and deaths of all 246 Americans on Flight 197), Victoria calls her and invites her for tea the next day.  Emily reveals to Victoria and Daniel during tea that she has become the official owner of the beach house.  Daniel then promises to take her out on a date. Conrad meets with Lydia (Amber Valletta), who informs him that she is ruined.  The pictures that Emily had taken of Lydia and Conrad had been sent to Lydia's ex-husband's lawyer.  Lydia had signed a pre-nup stating that if she were to commit adultery, she would get nothing.  Lydia demands that Conrad write her a big check.  As Emily is meeting Bill Harmon at a local cafe, she hugs Nolan and asks him to leave.  During the cafe meeting, Emily tells Bill that she wants to heavily invest in AllCom, a Chinese cellular company.  Bill asks her why, and she says \"a little bird might have whispered something.\" Emily calls Bill at his office and tells him that she wants to double her position with AllCom.  Bill then demands everyone in his firm to invest everything in AllCom, believing that Nolan (one of the richest men in the world) will offer a huge contract to AllCom.  However, Nolan says on the news moments later that he is investing in Unitech, AllCom's main competitor, instead.  Bill Harmon's company loses $2 billion from betting big on AllCom, and Bill orders his employees to keep quiet about the matter. Emily hacks into Bill's computer and prints out a list of Bill's top investors and informs them of the company's losses, posing as Bill's administrator. Jack Porter (Nick Wechsler) sells his boat named \"Amanda\" to Nolan to save his father's tavern from foreclosure.  On a romantic walk on the beach with Daniel, Emily informs him that her parents died in a car crash when she was a young age.  She then takes him to her house and Daniel surprises her with a housewarming party.  At the party, Emily tells Nolan that Bill Harmon is ruined, showing him a newscast on her phone of Bill's investors pulling out of his company. Though Emily talks to Jack again, she is not pleased to see him, and keeps the conversation light and short.  Victoria gets a call from Conrad's head of security, Frank (Max Martini), and he tells her that Emily's past from the ages of 16-18 is sealed by the courts, as though she never existed.  He then tells Victoria that Emily and Michael Davis (Lydia's ex-husband) were both on New York's landmark and preservation association. He observes that Michael and Emily were absent on the same day, and assumes that Emily was the woman Michael left Lydia for. Victoria demands that he follow Emily everywhere she goes. After all the guests have left, Emily lights a single candle on a cupcake and says quietly to herself, \"Happy Birthday Amanda\", implying it is her real birthday today."

        "content": "A few weeks after the events of the first film, teenager Elena Peters and her friends, Missy and Josh, go to a party. Elena witnesses her boyfriend, Brian, with another woman. She leaves the dance floor and enters an isolated room. In the room, Elena finds a box which Arkin is trapped. Elena carefully opens the latches, releasing Arkin, as a series of traps are set off party, killing dozens of party goers. Brian tries to escape but is killed while Elena watches in horror. She tries to help Missy, but is unable to prevent her being crushed by an elevator. The Collector appears and kidnaps Elena, while Arkin escapes by jumping out of a window, landing on a car and breaking his arm in the process. Arkin is taken to the hospital, where he is arrested by the police. After suffering nightmares of his torture from the Collector, he is approached by Lucello, an employee of Elena's wealthy father, who has hired a team of mercenaries to hunt the Collector down and save Elena. Lucello implies that if Arkin leads them to the Collector's hideout, he will expunge Arkin's record. Arkin leads the mercenary group to the Collector's base, an abandoned hotel. Meanwhile, Elena witnesses a man being tortured before escaping from the trunk. Upon the team's arrival, Arkin refuses to go inside, but Lucello forces him at gunpoint to guide them through the hotel. The Collector reenters the room and notices Elena has escaped before being alerted to the team's presence. Upon entering the hotel, the team is attacked by various people who the Collector has captured and driven insane with drugs, forcing the team to shoot them. Elena discovers another trunk and opens it. A seemingly innocent girl named Abby steps out, pleading to Elena for help before following her through the hotel to look for a way out. While wandering the hotel in separate groups, Arkin, Elena, and Lucello's team all encounter live humans being experimented on and human body parts rearranged to resemble insects, which are displayed in glass cases. Elena is discovered to have a hearing aid by Abby, who claims to be the Collector's favorite and is reluctant to break his rules. Abby screams that Elena is at a disadvantage because of her hearing aid, and will never win. The two are then separated when the Collector finds them. Elena and Lucello reunite and find Abby, who asks to escape with them. Elena, remembering Abby's earlier outburst, pleads with Lucello not to trust her, but he allows Abby to accompany the group. They find a room with a small window that they cannot escape through, but they see two homeless men outside. Arkin shoots one of the men, knowing that reports of a shooting will draw the police's attention. Abby sabotages their efforts of escaping before being killed by one of the Collector's traps. The Collector finds them and becomes enraged upon seeing Abby's body inside one of his traps. He attacks the group, grabs Elena, and escapes. As police converge at the hotel, the lights go out throughout the building. Lucello is caught in a trap and has to be left behind. Arkin and Paz find Elena strapped to an autopsy table, but when they approach, they are trapped in a cage that falls from above. The Collector appears and threatens to burn down the building, but Arkin manages to open the cage by having Elena re-break his arm so that he can reach the latch. The group escapes and finds an exit door to the building, but it is jammed from the outside. The Collector appears again. As the Collector is about to kill Arkin, Lucello intervenes, having escaped from his trap, and sacrifices himself so that Arkin can gain the upper hand. Arkin beats the Collector, throws him down a chute, and sets it on fire. As the building burns down, the firefighters hear Elena's screams and open the door from the outside, allowing Elena and Arkin to escape. As the two sit outside, Arkin notices a pile of trunks and, upon searching inside them, finds the Collector's burned mask with no corpse. Sometime later, Arkin manages to track down the Collector's house by researching every registered entomologist within a 200-mile radius of their last encounter. Arkin confronts the unmasked Collector, holds him at gunpoint, and taunts him about his father, a museum curator who, Arkin has learned, was responsible for the Collector's madness and modus operandi. Arkin announces his intentions of torturing and eventually killing the Collector, so that he can never harm anyone again. When the Collector tries to attack him, Arkin forces him into the red trunk and locks him inside."

Heini accepts and duly turns up at the railway station the next day. The Hitler Youth are also there, taking the same train. When the communists arrive at their own camp, there is only smoking, drinking, and dancing.  Boys and girls play games like cards, unlike the games which Heini expected.  Heini doesn't feel welcome, and wanders away.  In another part of the forest, Heini comes across the Hitler Youth camping by a lake where they are holding a midsummer bonfire. Heini watches them from a distance, but is caught by them, and taken into the camp, but they recognised him as having travelled with the communists, and so they send him away as well.  Heini sees them doing all the things that he hoped to participate in, i.e. 'wholesome' camping and swimming.  He is enamored by their singing.  In the morning, Heini watches the Hitler Youth's morning activities, but Stoppel comes looking for him.  He hides from Stoppel and instead catches a ride into town from a stranger.  When Heini returns to his home, he tells his mother about the Hitler Youth, and sings one of their songs to her, but his father overhears it and beats him for it. Heini wants to join the Hitler Youth and visits one of the Hitler Youth members' home, promising to come to the opening of their new club house.  However, he arrives late, just as the communists are attacking the Hitler Youth members.  Even though he had nothing to do with the attack, he is among those arrested by the police.  The police arrest some of the Hitler Youth, but no communists.  When the police let him go, he is recognised by the Hitler Youth members, who accuse him of colluding with the communists during the attack. Stoppel is impressed by the fact that Heini didn't tell the police that the communists were the ones who started the ruckus.  He confides in him that the communists plan to attack the Hitler Youth later that day, but Heini is distraught and threatens to tell the Hitler Youth about the attack.  He attempts to warn Ulla by telephone, but Fritz dismisses the matter.  Heini also informs the police, but they do not believe him either.  In the end, Ulla seems to have convinced Fritz to do something, as the communists' weapons store is blown up. Stoppel realises that Heini must have warned the Hitler Youth, and he goes to Heini's house and hints to his mother that he is going to kill him.  However, later Stoppel has a change of heart and orders the communists not to retaliate against Heini. Heini's mother is so distraught that she decides to kill her son and herself by shutting the windows and leaving the gas on in their apartment at night. She is killed, but Heini survives. Heini's father happens to meet Heini's Hitler Youth troop leader, Kass, when both men go to see Heini at the hospital. It is here that Heini's father reveals that he was injured in the war, and that that is the reason he could not work.  Kass attempts to convince Heini's father to join the Nazis.  Heini decides to move into a hostel run by the Hitler Youth, where he discovers to his dismay that not all members of Hitler Youth have such high moral values as he had thought.  They call him Quex, originally as an insult, a shortening of \u201cQuecksilber\u201d (quicksilver). The Hitler Youth leader takes care not to send Heini to the district where the communists live, but they find out where he is staying. Stoppel seeks Heini out on the street, and tries to convince him to return to the communists. Heini refuses, and Stoppel warns him not to return to the communist district.  One day, one of the Hitler Youth is beaten up by the communists while putting up posters , and Heini convinces his leader to allow him to visit the communist district to hand out flyers.  However, his fellow Hitler Youth Grundler has been taken in by the communist girl Gerda, and throws all the flyers in the river.  Heini then offers to reprint all the posters during the night and puts up the posters before the morning.  The communists hear about this and chase him and stab him. The Hitler Youth find him lying face-down dying."

        "content": "A recurring character in the film is the Communist street performer.  His theme is that \"for some people things work out well... but for George they never do.\"  The message is that life in Germany may improve for everyone else, but for the working man, George, life won't be good unless he joins the Communist Party. Heini V\u00f6lker's antagonist is the communist youth leader Wilde, \"a Nazi version of the incarnation of the 'Jewish-Bolshevik' will to destruction\". The film allows some sympathy for communists.  Heini's father, though violent and drunk, has become a communist because of his, and the workers', desperate condition.  In one scene, his argument for his son being with him revolves around his sufferings in the war and his unemployment.  Stoppel, the communist who invited Heini to a Communist Youth outing, while saying that he has to be eliminated, takes no part in the killing, Quex having made a strong impression on him."

She hasn't got enough money to cover her bill, so he surreptitiously pays for her. Later, after sending a telegram to his boss asking for funds, Larry sees Anne again, trying to send a wire to her mother for money to come home. Unable to pay for the message, she leaves, and Larry recovers her note. Exiting to the street, he thinks he sees Anne throw herself in front of a car, so he grabs her, making it look as if she embraces him wildly.  He admits to her that he is broke and that he knows she is, as well. They take a suite in a Hotel, pretending to be on their honeymoon and try to raise some money. After being revealed to the hotel manager, Larry receives fifty dollars from his coworkers, which gives them some time. Larry attempts to get a job with a local paper because he has a line on the Eel, a local gangster.  But his boss in Chicago denies his identity.  Again out of money, Larry pawns a police revolver he was given as an award for solving a case in Chicago. Shortly thereafter, Larry and Anne witness a robbery by the Eel, where a police officer is killed. Larry takes the place of the getaway driver and gets the loot before driving off. The next day, Larry describes the robbery to the police, while hiding his involvement. But when the gun used is found, it turns out to be Larry's. Once the police figure out Larry's part in the robbery, he is suspected of murder. When his boss in Chicago finally admits who he is to the police, he is given twenty-four hours to find the Eel.  Returning with Anne to the pawn shop, which they have worked out is the meeting place, Larry confronts the pawn broker, reveals he knows of the broker's complicity and they fight.  Having knocked out the broker, Larry pretends to be him when the Eel arrives. But the Eel isn't fooled and attempts to shoot him, but is shot by Anne, instead. When the story hits the papers, Larry is worried because they all refer to Anne as \"Mrs. Doyle\", meaning they'll have to get married, which is fine with them both."

The episode was written by developers Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton, and directed by David Von Ancken. The pilot introduces the series' protagonist, Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount), a former Confederate soldier whose quest for vengeance has led him to the Union Pacific Railroad's westward construction of the first transcontinental railroad. The pilot episode was filmed entirely in Alberta, Canada, with assistance from the provincial government of Alberta's film-development program. \"Hell on Wheels\" garnered a 3.1 HH rating, attracting 4.4 million viewers (2.4 million, aged 18\u201349; 2.3 million, aged 25\u201354) to become the second highest series premiere in AMC\u2019s history.

        "content": "The series opens in the year 1865, shortly after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. A young Union soldier (Tom Carey) enters a church in Washington, D.C. to confess his sins. Shortly after he begins, the priest asks the soldier about Meridian. The soldier, confused, asks the priest how he knows about Meridian and is then shot dead by the priest, who exits the confessional to reveal that he is not a priest, but Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount), a former Confederate soldier. Meanwhile, Thomas \"Doc\" Durant gives an inspiring speech about building the Transcontinental Railroad to a group of prominent Americans, including Senator Jordan Crane (James D. Hopkin). Afterward, Durant reveals to Crane that, through the use of Durant's company, Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier, Durant will essentially pay himself to build the railroad with government subsidies. Durant bribes Crane with shares in Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier to secure his assistance in this endeavor, ensuring Crane's support by threatening to route his railroad to exclude the Nebraska lands Crane owns, which would significantly lower their value. Arriving at the Hell on Wheels encampment, Bohannon seeks work from Foreman Daniel Johnson (Ted Levine), and though Bohannon has no experience in railroad work, Johnson hires him as a \"walking boss\" after learning Bohannon had owned slaves before the Civil War. Johnson introduces Bohannon to the \"cut crew\" - the men who dig the trail for the rails to be laid in - which is predominantly black. In a nearby river, the idealistic Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) baptizes a young Native American, Joseph Black Moon (Eddie Spears). Afterward, the two ride into the Hell on Wheels camp, to set up their church. Deep in the Nebraska Territory, surveyor Robert Bell (Robert Moloney) plots the railroad's path, with a small surveying team that includes his wife, Lily (Dominique McElligott). Robert urges Lily to return to Chicago, as they are entering hostile Cheyenne territory, but he is ill, and she refuses to leave him. The following day, they are attacked by a small group of Cheyenne, which slaughters all the surveyors (most of whom are unarmed) except Robert and Lily, who manage to escape. However, they are caught by one of the Native American braves, who kills Robert and wounds Lily. She kills the brave, in self-defense, and takes Robert's maps, which show the route through the Rocky Mountains discovered by the team, and flees into the woods. On his way to Hell on Wheels, Durant learns of Bell's death, which greatly complicates things. While digging the cut, Willie, one of Bohannon's workers, almost collapses because of the heat. Elam Ferguson (Common) aids him to get drinking water, but before they can return to the cut, Johnson arrives on horseback. A nearby explosion startles the horse, which kicks Willie twice, killing him. Although the death was unintentional, Johnson tells his workers, \"This is what happens when you break my rules.\" After the day's work is finished, Bohannon visits Elam's tent. He finds Elam sharpening a knife, intent on killing Johnson to avenge Willie's death. Bohannon tries to talk him out of it and later joins Johnson for a drink. After they discuss the war, Bohannon asks Johnson if he has ever been to Meridian. Johnson responds by taking Bohannon hostage. Johnson tells Bohannon that he read of the Union soldier killed in Washington, DC by a Griswold revolver, and seeing Bohannon's Griswold when he hired him, coupled with Bohannon's mention of Meridian, confirmed his suspicions. Johnson lets slip that Bohannon's wife was murdered; she did not commit suicide as the widower had thought. Rather, Johnson claims \"the sergeant\" strangled Bohannon's wife and hung her to cover up the murder, but Johnson refuses to grant Bohannon's request to name the sergeant. Elam appears and slits Johnson's throat, saving Bohannon but killing his chances learning the sergeant's identity."

She became addicted to drugs, and six years ago, she reportedly killed a police officer, though she cannot remember whether she did so or not. She was sentenced to death, but Division faked her execution and trained her to be an assassin. However, she broke one of their rules by falling in love with a civilian, Daniel Monroe (Sebastien Roberts). Division had Daniel killed in what appeared to be an accident, and this prompted Nikita to escape. Nikita explains all of this to Gary, knowing full well that doing so would alert Division to her presence. Meanwhile, in Detroit, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) is captured by the police during a failed robbery, while her accomplice escapes. Shortly after being brought to prison, Alex wakes up to find herself inside Division. Michael (Shane West), Division's second-in-command, informs Alex that they have faked her death and that she is being offered a second chance - an opportunity to serve her government. She soon meets two other recruits, Thom (Ashton Holmes) and Jaden (Tiffany Hines), as well as Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who also assists in training the recruits. Amanda guesses correctly that Alex had been smuggled to the US after being sold to human traffickers in Ukraine. Percy (Xander Berkeley), the head of Division gets wind of Nikita's reemergence and assigns Michael to kill her. Nikita once again gets Division's attention by visiting Daniel's grave. A strike team is sent to go after her, but, during the attack, Nikita captures Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford), Division's head technician. She demands that he give her access to Division's computer network. Even though he doesn't comply, she lets Birkhoff return to Division unharmed. In spite of Nikita, Percy decides to go ahead with all of Division's operations, including Operation Black Arrow, in which the head of a West African nation is targeted for assassination. Nikita learns about Black Arrow from an unknown source and sabotages the mission. Nikita then comes face-to-face with Percy and Michael at a government fundraiser and tells Percy of her intentions to destroy Division. Michael chases her out of the building and has the opportunity to kill her, but he hesitates. He tells Nikita that Percy cannot be stopped because he has evidence of every illegal Division operation ever done and that this information would irreparably damage the US government. Michael decides to let Nikita escape, but she shoots him in the shoulder before running off, claiming that she is protecting him since the wound would make it look like he tried to stop her. Percy immediately names Nikita Division's priority target and believes that she is working with someone who is giving her information on Division's operations. It is revealed that Alex is Nikita's source inside Division and that Nikita was Alex's accomplice during the robbery that resulted in Alex's recruitment into Division."

        "content": "The Flemish boys Lars, Philip and Jozef are somewhere between 20 and 30 years of age and each has a physical handicap. Jozef is almost blind and needs to use a magnifier. Philip suffers from paraplegia. He can only move his head and can use one hand which gives him the strength to control his automated wheelchair. Lars has an incurable brain tumor a side effect of which is that he is restricted to a wheelchair as a result of his increasing paralysis.  The three are good friends and visit each other frequently. Philip, who is able to control a computer keyboard with a mouthpiece, had a conversation with a man who lost his legs during his last holiday at the Dutch sea-side. That man frequently visits a luxury brothel in Spain which is specialized to host men with a handicap. Philip convinces Lars and Jozef to organize a trip to Spain \"as they do not want to die as a virgin\". Of course, they have to convince their parents but are afraid to tell them the real reason about the trip. That's why they deceive them and tell them that they are only going to visit some wine gardens in France and Spain. As Lars already made a well-organized plan about the trip and found a tour guide who is specialized in \"holidays for people with a handicap\" the parents eventually agree. Some days before departure, Lars goes to his doctor for approval to make the trip, but it seems his brain tumor has grown. His doctor advises to cancel his trip. Philip and Jozef initially cancel as well since they do not want to abandon Lars. Lars however insists that the trip should continue, so they decide to leave sneakily. However, the tour operator can't make the trip any more as it was cancelled by the parents, and does not want to jeopardize his professional and private life by ignoring the wishes of the parents. The tour operator takes pity and decides to send Claude, who also owns a specialized bus. They are surprised when Claude seems to be an oversized, unattractive, grouchy woman who does not understand Flemish (as she lives in Brussels). Philip and Lars dislike Claude and always use abusive Dutch language to describe \"the insensible mammoth-looking woman\". Neither Philip nor Lars speaks French, so Jozef becomes the interpreter. He is more friendly towards Claude and can't laugh with the remarks of Philip and Lars. Claude seems not to be very sociable. She only drives the boys to their different destinations and separates herself during each break. She does want to help the boys, but is always refused. The three are convinced they do not need Claude as \"a replacement for their parents\" and can handle the situation. Soon, they discover this is not that easy. Claude insists that the boys must accept her as they do need her help as a nurse. The three are surprised when they discover Claude does understand the Dutch language. They are embarrassed and ask Claude to forgive their misbehaviour, which she accepts. The following days are very entertaining and Claude decides to overnight in open sky. The next day, she drives them to a hotel. The three are led to a meeting room and are astonished when they meet their parents. They were able to locate their sons via the original tour operator who gave them the mobile number of Claude. Claude, who got a call of the parents, could not refuse the parents' request to drive them to this hotel. She is just out of prison due to maltreatment of her previous husband and does not want to get into new problems. The parents want to take their children back to Belgium. Philip and Lars get very aggressive and scream they do not want to be treated like children. Lars insists that his parents let them continue the trip. Eventually, they approve of their sons continuing the trip to Spain with Claude as a guide. Once they arrive Claude surprises them by taking them to a villa instead of the foreseen bungalow, which is a present from the parents. The boys decide that they want to see the night-life of the Spanish town. Claude brings them to the centre and allows them to take off by themselves. They try to strike up a conversation with a couple of girls and invite them to go to a restaurant together. Although the girls provide them with a recommendation, they are reluctant to join and state they don't have enough time, so the boys take off on their own. On the way to the restaurant, Lars is taken aside by a different girl which he had met before in a shop. He instructs Philip and Jozef to continue without him and takes off with the girl. Later on they are talking but Lars gets sick and is embarrassed. When Philip and Jozef return to the bus after dinner, they find Lars already there, clearly upset. Philip starts ranting about Lars ditching them, but Jozef tells him to 'shut up'. The first visit at the brothel is a disaster as Lars gets ill. During their next visit, Jozef does not want to go as he fell in love with Claude. This seems to be mutual and the two have sex in the tour bus. Lars and Philip enjoy their visit in the brothel. That night, the group decides to sleep on the beach. Next morning, Philip finds a dead Lars. Philip is picked up by his parents to travel to Belgium by aeroplane, whereas Jozef decides to stay with his new girlfriend Claude who drives him back to Belgium on her bus."

        "content": "The parallel universe's Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) recently had her father die; as she has Asperger syndrome, she concludes the only person she can talk to is herself, and discreetly crosses over through the Machine Room bridge to meet with the prime universe's version of Astrid (Nicole).  After a bit of initial surprise and discovery, the parallel version of Astrid explains that her father was aloof and distant to her special needs, and the prime Astrid admits the same, but implies she found a way to deal with them.  When parallel Astrid's disappearance is discovered in the parallel universe, Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) sends Fauxlivia (Anna Torv) across to escort her back. When she arrives, Walter (John Noble) is initially bitter about her arrival, recalling her deceitful tactics she used to earn his trust when she was sent to take the prime Olivia's (Torv) place, but he soon warms up to her, and they share a number of questionably pleasant memories during that time. Meanwhile, the prime universe's Fringe team learns of the death of a man who had just learned that he only had a short time to live due to cancer; his death was not natural, however, instead caused by a toxic aerosol spray that leaves him with bloody tears, giving him the appearance of the \"Tears of Ra\".  Walter identifies the poison as something that could not have been developed by technology in either universe. They are alerted to another man, Jared (G. Michael Grey), who had just survived a car accident that left him paraplegic.  Jared explains about a man that claimed he could see past, present, and future, and wanted to save Jared from suffering as a paraplegic by killing him before the accident; instead Jared ran, scared, into the accident himself.  With information from Jared and help from the parallel version of Astrid, they recognize their man as a TSA agent at the airport who had cleared all his victims prior. When Peter and Olivia approach him, he evades capture. Olivia and Peter (Joshua Jackson) learn their murderer is Neil (Chin Han), a former professor from MIT. A colleague there explains that, after spending a period of time at his lake house, Neil became fascinated by a series of high-level equations, ignoring work duties to study them and eventually abandoning his position. The two become concerned when they learn the lake house was on Reiden Lake, where, in this timeline, Walter had unsuccessfully tried to bring the parallel universe's version of Peter back over, and where Peter had reappeared within this timeline.  At the lake house, they learn that Neil survived a car accident as a child that took his father and brother. Realizing Neil's mother is still alive, the two descend on her home, and find Neil there. Neil explains to his mother that, shortly after the accident, he had overheard her claiming that God took the wrong son, and has been trying to act as a savior to prove her wrong. As the Fringe team bursts into the home, Neil recounts that angels don't belong on earth, and fires a gunshot towards Olivia, upon which she returns fire and kills him. As the scene is cleared up, Olivia realizes that Neil had purposely missed her to get her to kill him, since he would not have become an angel if he had taken his own life. The parallel versions of Astrid and Olivia soon return to their universe after warm goodbyes; the prime universe's Astrid is shown returning home into the welcoming arms of her father (Blu Mankuma), despite what she had told her doppelganger. At Neil's mother's home, two Observers, including December, locate Neil's safe and find a glowing blue tube, containing the aerosol formula. They recognize the tube as belonging to September, apparently lost when he had unsuccessfully tried to save Peter at Reiden Lake in 1985. December learns that Peter has reappeared in this timeline."

        "content": "The plot takes place in Beecham House, a retirement home for former professional musicians, patterned after the real-life Casa di Riposo per Musicisti founded by Giuseppe Verdi. Reg, Wilf and Cissy are retired opera singers who often worked together in the past; among other residents are Cedric Livingstone, a former director, and diva Anne Langley. All the guests in the retirement home are suffering in varying degree the ailments old age can bring but continue to be engaged in their former professions in one way or another, including lecturing and introducing young people to music. Finances threaten closure of the home, but proceeds from a yearly gala concert on Verdi's birthday hold hope for a continuation of the place. However, Cedric has become rather desperate because some of the most prominent singers have either died or decided not to participate at all. Reg, Wilf and Cissy were in the cast of a very highly rated recording of the opera Rigoletto, which includes a famous quartet for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor and baritone (\"Bella figlia dell'amore\"). This version is very prominent among opera buffs as THE Rigoletto of the post-war era. Reg is shocked to find his former wife Jean Horton, the missing soprano of the Rigoletto recording, turning up to live at Beecham House. Reg is angry not to have been warned or consulted as their parting was on very sour terms. At first, Jean tries unsuccessfully to mend things with Reg. In the ensuing conversations her infidelity arises, as well as her past marriages, but Reg comes to understand that all that is now in the past. In the meantime, Cedric has come up with a plan that could work, but has one flaw. He meets with Wilf, Cissy and Reg to put his idea to them. His hope is to convince them to re-form the quartet who sang on the famous recording and to sing it again for the Verdi Gala concert, hoping it will sell enough tickets to save the home. Reg is sceptical but agrees, having overcome his issues and problems with Jean living at the home and being in such close proximity daily. Wilf persuades the doctor in charge to allow them a night out, resulting in Reg, Wilf and Cissy inviting Jean to dinner. Blissfully unaware and thinking friendships mended and repaired, with the past forgotten, Jean accepts the invitation; however, she is harder to persuade as she vowed never to sing again after retiring, resulting in her getting angry and storming out of the restaurant. The following morning, Cissy brings Jean flowers from the garden to cheer her up, and asks if she wishes to discuss the quartet, but Jean doesn't want to take the flowers and beats Cissy with them, which only aggravates Cissy's already delicate senile condition. Jean apologises and is finally persuaded to sing in the quartet from Rigoletto, after learning that Anne Langley will be singing \"Vissi d'arte\" from Tosca as a finale, unless the four of them sing together, in which case they will be given pride of place as the last to perform. The group prepare for their performance and, moments before their curtain call, Cissy gets very confused and attempts to walk out the door, saying that she has to go back to her family, but Jean manages to salvage the situation. During her conversation with Cissy, Jean expresses regret for all her past bad behaviour towards Reg and admits that she is still in love with him. Reg overhears this. Just as the recital is about to start, the director of the home is amazed at the energy displayed by the guests of the home. The idea of rehearsing and playing before an audience has brought life back to the home and the quartet. Prior to going on stage, Reg asks Jean to marry him again. As the quartet enter the stage individually, and to the rapturous applause of the audience, Reg stands next to Jean. Jean asks Reg if he was serious, he replies yes. Jean accepts and takes Reg by the hand."

However, his obsession with speed often makes him an outcast in the slow and cautious snail community, and a constant embarrassment to his older brother, Chet. One night, Theo wanders onto a freeway to admire the traffic and wishes upon a star, later revealed to be an airplane, that he was fast. Suddenly, he is sucked into the supercharger of a Chevrolet Camaro drag racer, fusing his atoms with nitrous oxide. When he wakes up, he possesses superspeed and some characteristics of a real car. However, his first attempt to try out his new powers ends with him crashing a boy's tricycle into the garden in which many other snails work, resulting in him and Chet getting fired from the garden crew. Chet angrily scolds Theo for his recklessness and ends up being snatched by a crow, but is pursued and rescued by Theo at a run-down strip mall called Starlight Plaza. There, they are captured by Tito Lopez, a Mexican-American taco truck driver, and are brought to a snail race held by him and his co-workers. Theo wins the race in a matter of seconds, astounding both humans and snails alike, earning the respect of the snails, led by Whiplash, and firmly establishing the name \"Turbo\" as his own. Chet, on the other hand, is not happy with his brother's new ability. Tito dreams of reviving Starlight Plaza, in which his taco business is set up, with Turbo as an attraction, much to his brother and coworker Angelo's annoyance. The snails eventually manage to divert and strand a tour bus, bringing impressive business. At this success, Turbo convinces Tito to enter him in the Indianapolis 500 as a competitor. The neighbors agree to put up the entrance fee and accompany them to Indianapolis. Tito is initially refused entry into the race due to insulting a race official, but a chance meeting with Gagn\u00e9 gives Turbo a chance to show off his speed, astounding the audience and the racers by qualifying for the race via achieving a speed of 226 mph, becoming a sensation on social media and forcing the CEO of IndyCar to reluctantly let Turbo compete. The night before the race, after a heated argument with Chet, Turbo sneaks out to meet Gagn\u00e9, who reveals his true colors by demoralizing him. In the race, the racetrack and the more experienced competitors leave him trailing in last place. At a pitstop, Whiplash and the crew give Turbo a vital pep talk, advising him to stop racing like a car. Turbo uses his small size to his advantage and rapidly gains ground, but Gagn\u00e9 resorts to cheating and knocks him against the wall, damaging his shell and weakening his superspeed. With one lap to go and Turbo in the lead, Gagn\u00e9, refusing to lose to a snail, inadvertently drives over debris on the last turn, causing a pile-up involving most of the competitors, including Turbo, who wakes to find his shell punctured and his superspeed gone, so he falls into deep despair. Alarmed at seeing his brother losing hope, Chet, with a change of heart, braves several dangers to meet with Whiplash's crew. Seeing Chet and the crew arrive on crows to encourage him to continue, Turbo resumes the race. Gagn\u00e9 single-mindedly pursues him, dragging his wrecked car, but Turbo narrowly wins and Gagn\u00e9 is assaulted by one of the strip mall business owners for trying to harm him. Starlight Plaza thrives from Turbo's fame; all the businesses become spectacular successes and hold elaborate snail races. Whiplash's crew are given special propulsion aids for their shells, while Chet is content with his new job as the track referee and paramedic. As for Turbo, he discovers that his shell has healed, and with it, his superspeed has returned. In a mid-credits scene, one of the snails from Turbo and Chet's garden is finally able to tuck into his shell, only to realize that he is too big to come out."

        "content": "At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) attempts to put on a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing to other hipsters, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator\u00a0 \u201cto pray on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the pyramid\u201d \u2014 much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim\u00a0\u2014 who imitate Kelly Kapoor and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down\u00a0\u2014 leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie. In Scranton, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to protect Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) from a group of kids who are throwing pinecones at her, and a young girl, Tiffany (Caitlin Williams), punches him, giving him a black eye. Andy tells his co-workers that he stepped in when a \"gang\" harassed Pam, and Pam plays along out of gratitude to Andy and not wanting to embarrass him. At Andy's suggestion, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs at his misfortune, but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends."

The driver of the cart fearfully apologizes though Baelfire insists he is okay. Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) comes to check on his son who has a scraped knee. As punishment, he turns the driver into a snail and squashes him. Back at home, Rumpelstiltskin treats Baelfire's scrape but the boy refuses magic. Baelfire explains that everyone avoids him because they fear his father. Rumpelstiltskin explains that the only way to destroy his power would be killing him with his own dagger. The housekeeper overhears this, but being a mute, she does not respond. Baelfire asks his father if he could get rid of his power without hurting either one of them, would he do it. Rumpelstiltskin agrees, but he doubts that it is possible. The next day, Rumpelstiltskin encourages Baelfire to play with the other kids while he attends to some business in the woods. Baelfire deduces from the blood on his father's boot that he has killed their housekeeper to keep the dagger a secret. A friend of Baelfire's suggests he call on the Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy), which he does. The fairy offers Baelfire a magic bean that will take them to a land where magic does not exist and his father would be human again. However this bean is the last one of its kind and will only work once. When Baelfire goes to his father with the plan, Rumpelstiltskin is skeptical, but his son reminds him that he promised. Father and son take the bean into the woods and throw it on the ground. A vortex opens which will take them to the land with no magic. Baelfire jumps in while holding his father's hand, but Rumpelstiltskin resists, saying he cannot go through with it. His son calls him a coward and lets go. The vortex closes, taking Baelfire away and leaving Rumpelstiltskin behind. He realizes he has made a terrible mistake and calls on the Blue Fairy for help. The Blue Fairy tells Rumpelstiltskin that was his only chance and there is no other way to the realm where his son has gone. When Rumpelstiltskin suggests a curse might take him to Baelfire, the fairy's hesitation tells him he is onto something, but she is opposed to the idea, because she does not believe that he is willing to pay the price of the curse. Rumpelstiltskin lashes out at the fairy for taking his son away, but she tells Rumpelstilskin that he drove his own son away. Rumpelstiltskin vows that he will not rest until he creates such a curse and finds his son."

To perform a proper assessment, she removes Jake from the home and places him in an institution for two weeks where she can monitor him.

Ranjith makes it clear that he opted for Mohanlal as he felt he was the best for this character. Talking about the film, Ranjith explains: \"I believe there are two kinds of people in Kerala. On one hand, you have intelligent, successful people who become slaves to alcohol. They cannot function without it. As a result of it, their families suffer. Many of these alcoholics have marital problems and often, physically and emotionally, abuse their spouse.

But the project was postponed and Ranjith began the works of Spirit. According to Shankar Ramakrishnan, who was to play the lead in Leela, \"Leela has a landscape and a mindscape and the film was postponed as it requires us [the crew] to travel from Kottayam to Wayanad.\" Ranjith completed the film's script in a short time and the whole film, including post-production works, was completed in about a month.

Having been estranged from his father since childhood, he views the corpse dispassionately and leaves with a cardboard box containing pyjamas and other possessions including a mobile phone. To Cristoffer's surprise, the phone rings and he finds himself speaking to a lawyer who is handling the estate\u2014and who later turns out to be the father's gay lover. Returning to his hotel room, he confronts Maja with his knowledge of a clandestine affair she has been engaged in.

Christoffer learns from the solicitor that most of his father's assets have been committed to outstanding debts, but that he has inherited an unencumbered house. When he goes to inspect the substantial rural cottage, he meets the beautiful young housekeeper, Alena, who lives there with a daughter and works as a nightclub singer. They soon form a rapport, despite the fact that she speaks only Czech while he is limited to Danish and English. She is unable to answer his question about exactly what business his dad was in.

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they have a thigh curl contest to settle the argument. During the contest, Jim props their elbows up on pillows and tricks them into thinking they each have phone calls, then takes a picture, editing it as a computer wallpaper to make it look like Gabe and Dwight have had a gossipy sleepover. Dwight and Gabe are angered that Jim is mocking them for \u201cperfecting [their] bodies,\u201d but can\u2019t properly walk to the conference room, forcing Dwight to have Jim support him. While \"celebrating the finalization of his divorce\", Robert California (James Spader) drunkenly shuts down the Binghamton branch of Dunder Mifflin. The resulting commotion allows the sales team in Scranton, specifically Jim and Dwight, to begin poaching former customers of the closed branch. Harry Jannerone (Chris Bauer), an angry employee from the Syracuse branch of Dunder Mifflin arrives in Scranton to berate Jim and Dwight for taking New York clients even though those particular clients are closer to Scranton than Syracuse. The two argue, dropping the name of a particularly large client, Prestige Direct Sale Solutions, that is up for grabs. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is cooking lunch for everyone in the office, overhears the argument and gets an idea: if he can win the client, he might be able to use the account as leverage to get his job as manager back. Andy rushes to Prestige Direct and impresses the CEO (Dan Castellaneta) with his dedication\u2014in addition to his personal phone number, he also gives him a copy of his house key. Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the client, only to hear that the company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins the client, he calls Robert and offers him the client if Robert will re-hire him. Furious at his attempt to blackmail him, Robert profanely threatens Andy, and hangs up on him. This leads Andy to seek help from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire. Andy tells David that, despite being in poor shape, Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company's management is restructured. This piques David's interest, who allows Andy to come into his home and talk to him about his business proposal. After Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) reveals to Robert that he sent her a sexually suggestive voicemail, Robert tasks Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with finding what the voicemail entailed. Initially, Pam tries to trick Nellie into divulging the contents of the message, but this plan is ruined when Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) shows up, claiming that she was Robert's \"back-up plan\" in case Pam failed. Finally, Pam steals Nellie's phone and brings it to Robert and the two listen to the various voice messages. After hearing several which paint a life for Nellie that is sad and lonely\u2014she is unable to adopt a child and she has maxed out her credit cards\u2014Pam relents and tells Robert that she will not help him anymore. Pam returns Nellie's phone and the two strike up a conversation. Nellie reveals to Pam her disgust for Robert, saying that he is sexually obsessed. She asks Pam if she wants to hear about Robert's voicemail, but Pam declines her offer. In the end, Nellie reveals to the camera that she is deeply moved to have a real friend at her work place. After learning that they have lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break. They end up having a conversation over what they would do with their lives, if they were not working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and suggests they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces."

When the Pope (Jeremy Irons) learns of his arrival in Naples, he asks his son Cesare (Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud) if he knows of someone who could kill the Cardinal. della Rovere and Alfonso discuss deposing the Pope, with della Rovere offering to recognize the independence of Naples (from the claims of Spain and France), should he be elected Pope when Alexander is deposed. Alfonso is not convinced, as he believes Naples is already a proven free kingdom. He takes della Rovere to a dining room, where King Ferrante had his enemies stuffed and put on display, as a warning to anyone who would cross him. Meanwhile, in Rome, the Pope discusses the Vatican's financial woes with his sons Cesare and Juan (David Oakes). He suggests taking in the marranos, which have recently been exiled from Spain by Queen Isabella, at a high price. While emptying della Rovere's estate, Cesare meets with Micheletto (Sean Harris) and tells him to travel to Naples to assassinate the Cardinal. When Micheletto arrives in Naples, he hides in the dining room among King Ferrante's stuffed enemies until night falls, but before reaching della Rovere's room, he sees two guards posted outside and retreats. Reforming his plan, he attempts to kill della Rovere at a sulphur bath, but is discovered by the Cardinal, recognizing Micheletto's badly scarred back. In Rome, the Pope introduces his 13 new Cardinals in a ceremony at the Vatican. Micheletto barely escapes the baths, and della Rovere is expelled from Naples by Alfonso. The Pope consults Giulia Farnese (Lotte Verbeek) and Cesare on a request from the Sultan of Constantinople to house his half brother, Prince Cem (Elyes Gabel), for 40,000 ducats a year. In dire need of finances, they decide to accept Djem, even though he is a Muslim. When Cem arrives, he instantly develops a friendship with Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger) and Juan, whom he calls his \"Christian brother\". While Juan and Lucrezia entertain Djem, the Pope and Cesare begin the search for a husband for Lucrezia. While they have received offers from all over Christendom, the Pope and Cesare agree that to sustain the papacy, her husband must be Italian. While watching Cem and Juan practice swordplay, the Pope reveals to Cesare that the Sultan offered him 400,000 ducats if Djem were to die while in their care. The Pope meets with representatives for several suitors of Lucrezia, but during the meetings, he sees Lucrezia dancing with Djem. He decides that she will be married to Giovanni Sforza (Ronan Vibert), to secure a union with Milan, and to ensure that della Rovere is turned away from Milan on his road to France. Juan comes to Cesare, in search of Micheletto's services. Cesare quickly deduces that the Pope intends to kill Djem and use the money from the Sultan to pay Lucrezia's dowry. He refuses Juan's request, knowing that Lucrezia loves Djem and would miss him at her wedding. Juan, now unable to use Micheletto, plots with a cook to poison Djem's tea with cantarella. During a small gathering the following day, Cem drinks the poisoned tea, and quickly falls ill, but does not die as Juan expected. After consulting Micheletto, who tells them Cem will be in agony for weeks, Cesare makes Juan finish what he started. Juan enters Cem's room and smothers him with a pillow."

        "content": "The film follows a group of friends that are small-time criminals in Sneinton, a suburb of Nottingham.  The main protagonists are best friends, Jumbo and Malc.  At the beginning of the film we hear Jumbo narrating, \"We're not into anything heavy.  We just rob from the rich and sell it to the poor for half price.  We're just small time.\" Malc and his partner Kate live next door to Jumbo and his partner Ruby.  Malc and Kate can continually hear the domestic abuse in the neighbouring house,  but Ruby is quick to defend Jumbo although she does concede that he is bad in bed and tells Kate that she uses a sex aid. Malc is unhappy with the way his life is going but cannot seem to find a way out of the situation.  Kate is unhappy too and pushes Malc to sever ties with the group.  Kate attends a yoga class and makes friends with a classmate, Martin, who invites Kate and Malc to his house for the evening.   Kate, Malc, Martin and his girlfriend, Elaine are having a good evening until Jumbo turns up uninvited having found out where they were from their babysitter.  Malc makes it clear that he doesn't want Jumbo there. Jumbo later relays this tale to the rest of the gang, who are not impressed with Malc's new attitude.  They decide to be nice to him until they have completed an armed robbery, which they need him for, and then cut him out of their circle of friends.  Malc is uncomfortable with the robbery but goes along anyway. They raid a small new age store that sells incense, charms and the like.  Malc acts as a look out on the street with Terry, who is driving the getaway van.  Whilst the raid is going on, Malc convinces Terry to drive off.  Jumbo and the rest of the gang realise that there is no money on the premise they leave when they hear police sirens, but there is now no getaway van so they have to make a run for it.  Meanwhile, Malc has taken the van and is doing a moonlight flit - in broad daylight - with his family.  The film ends with Jumbo being apprehended with by the police. As the credits roll we see what's happened to the gang; Willy, Jumbo and Bets are in prison, Lenny gets his comeuppance for his dodgy deals, Mad Terry looking after Malc and Kate's children in Skegness, where they now live.  Kate and Malc now run a refreshment hut by the sea."

Tom, who was assisting Anne, is kidnapped by Pope and his men and taken outside of the airfield and is told that quite a few people are afraid of Tom and question his escape from the aliens and demand that he leave the group. Ben and Jimmy get the drop on Pope and disarm him, and take him back to base. Weaver contemplates kicking Pope and his men out, but Tom insists that he be made part of Pope's \"Berserker\" group and put under Pope's command to keep an eye on him. The next night Jimmy and Ben, who have been going out beyond the perimeter looking for aliens, find another group of skitters. They kill two of them but the third one exerts some influence over Ben and paralyzes him, causing his spikes to glow blue. Jimmy attacks the alien, and is thrown against a tree. The alien runs off and Ben snaps out of his daze, and finds that Jimmy was impaled on a branch. He brings Jimmy back to the airfield where Anne does her best to save him. Weaver and Tom find out that Ben was deliberately seeking out aliens to kill as revenge for kidnapping him. Pope, Tom and the Berserkers head out to the spot where Jimmy was hurt and find his compass and encounter a group of aliens collecting the bodies of their dead. Pope orders them to attack but Tom countermands the order; shortly thereafter a mech arrives and escorts the aliens away. At the airfield, a plane arrives carrying a messenger from Charleston, who advises the 2nd Mass, that several groups of survivors as well as remnants of the U.S. government are massing in Charleston and have access to supplies and hot water. Weaver believes their best chance for survival is to head into the Catskill Mountains, while Tom believes that Charleston is the best option for staying in the fight as hiding in the mountains would be tantamount to surrendering. Despite Anne's best efforts, Jimmy dies of his wounds. Tom, when reminding the Berserkers of their impending move, notices that Pope has Jimmy's compass. Tom demands he return it, and Pope refuses and calls Jimmy's funeral \"an empty gesture\". Tom attacks Pope and savagely beats him before being restrained. Weaver sides with Tom, believing Pope was out of line. Pope decides to leave 2nd Mass and only Anthony leaves with him, more out of a desire to keep an eye on Pope than anything. Weaver decides to go to Charleston, and before they leave they have a funeral service for Jimmy. Afterwards Ben approaches Weaver who is standing at Jimmy's grave and breaks down, blaming himself for Jimmy's death while Weaver holds him. The 2nd Mass begins to leave for Charleston, when Tom realizes that Ben is missing from the group. Hal leaves in search of him. Ben is found still at Jimmy's grave, when suddenly, the skitter who previously exerted control on Ben reappears. The skitter controls him for a few seconds again, and seems to communicate with him. The skitter then breaks off and runs when it hears Hal's motorcycle approaching. Hal retrieves Ben and they head back, and Ben withholds the events that just transpired."

Before Karen can place a harness on him, Tom and the Second Mass arrive and start a firefight. Karen manages to slip away but, in the confusion, Tom manages to point a gun at an Overlord, causing the enemy forces to stand down. Realizing the value of his target, Tom decides to take the Overlord prisoner and take the creature to Charleston. Weaver resumes command and sends Matt along with Lourdes and Anne to get more supplies from the basement before they leave the hospital, with Matt along as security. Soon after the prisoner has been brought to base, the humans are attacked. Weaver realizes the frontal assault is a diversion and sends Tom to stop a mech that has sneaked through the back. While successful, the resulting explosion traps Anne, Lourdes and Matt in the basement. Karen then appears offering terms: Surrender the Overlord and everyone will be spared, though Tom and Hal don't buy this for a second. Ben and Tom argue over Ben's ultimate fate with the teen deciding to leave after this for the Second Mass' protection. In the basement, Anne, Lourdes and Matt come across an injured Jamil who was sent to look for them. He has no signs of visible injuries but is hurt in a bad way and cautions them not to open the door opposite him. At the same time, Maggie and Hal are nearly attacked in the tunnels by a swarm of spider-like creatures seemingly sent by the aliens to force man's hand. In the meantime, Jamil is revealed to have been made into a \"Trojan horse\" as several creatures erupt from his body and chase Anne, Lourdes and Matt, trapping them in the blood lab. Matt is sent through the air vents by Anne to fetch help and narrowly avoids being eaten by the creatures thanks to being found by Tom and Pope and is pulled out in time. The basement is sealed off but since the creatures can eat through metal like rats this is only a temporary measure. Karen appears again to tell the resistance it has run out of time and callously executes a captured fighter (Boon) to prove a point. An enraged Tom goes to confront the Overlord (the same one whom he spoke with on the ship) to demand answers. Through Ben the creature reveals that they're after something on Earth though it won't specify what and that the culling of humans was a favor.  Humans are a weak self-destructive species that fights over dwindling resources and is ruled by emotions. To prove a point it begins to kill Ben through the link. Tom retaliates by shooting the alien in the neck leaving Anne to try to keep their only bargaining chip alive. Weaver is furious at Tom's actions but admits if it was Jeannie in that situation he would have done the same. While still uncertain, both men realize Red Eye's claims about a skitter rebellion may be true. While the Overlords consider the resistance a minor irritant, the prospect of their own slaves starting an uprising has them rattled. This still doesn't change the fact that the resistance is trapped. Tom gets an idea and tells them to bring in Karen. A smug Karen is brought in and gloats to Hal about how predictable the resistance is and how they fell for her ruse. Her attitude changes when presented with the injured Overlord and she has to be restrained to hear Tom's proposition: Let the humans leave and she gets her master back to treat.  Though the aliens could blow them up with an air strike, Tom reveals they have wired the building with C4. The explosives are connected to a detonator that is with a hidden Pope and if he sees or gets word of trouble he will blow the building up, killing Karen and her master. The aliens are forced to agree with the resistance's demands. Ben and Tom say tearful goodbyes on the road as the convoy stops for a rest/refuel.  After Ben leaves on foot to join the skitter rebellion, the Second Mass begins the final leg of their journey to Charleston."

In the days before the blow, Renzo first comes into contact with Riccardo, a homosexual boy who works in a sauna, and after he has discovered him stealing in his wallet, he falls in love with him and follows him, being able to recognize him by the scent, and later with Stella, the young and attractive maid of the canteen of the company where he works, bored by the m\u00e9nage he entertains with the head of the canteen and with another assistant, who tries to seduce him but is rejected however. Renzo organizes the robbery in all the details, including the escape from Italy, also bribing a port employee to board a transport ship that will sail to Panama.

The police at first are clueless, but, due to some unforeseen events, some people who know Renzo begin to suspect him and endanger his cover: during the escape through the dungeons, where Stella is flirting with her lover, he drops a lighter which is picked up by her, and, remembering having seen it in his office when she went to bring him lunch, she reports it to the head of the canteen; together they go searching for clues in his office but are seen by Renzo who from that moment will try to eliminate them: the first will die locked up in the cold room, while the girl will be spared after being stunned. Two other people are aware of his role in the robbery: one of the company's security guards, who identified him thanks to the cufflinks of his shirt that he also wore during the action, who, after having searched his home, claims a part of the loot but Renzo will kill him before going to recover the money. The second is Riccardo who recognized him after seeing him take off his glasses in the sauna, without however reporting it to the police, who stopped him as a suspect, and also attempting, with the help of two accomplices, to steal the stolen goods but Renzo will be able to neutralize them before escaping. The last unexpected event is represented by the mother, hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic and whom he occasionally visits, who seeing the identikit of the bandit in the newspaper, immediately recognizes him as the son in front of the nurse nun, who immediately warns the police. giving the man's name and surname but Renzo, using a secret passage in his house, manages to get away before being captured, managing to board the ship for Panama and, in the last scene, waking up on the deck, receives breakfast by a sailor, rewarding him with a generous tip."

Instead of agreeing to Declan's offer to purchase the heisted methylamine for $15 million in exchange for removing Walt's blue meth from the drug market, Walt offers a counterproposal: to sell his superior product through Declan's distribution network in exchange for a substantial share of the business and a one-time, $5 million payment to Mike for his share. Frustrated with having to negotiate with Walt, Declan demands to know who he is. Refusing to back down, Walt insists that Declan already knows his name and demands that he say it. When Walt informs him that it was he who killed Gus, Declan resignedly realizes and acknowledges Walt as Heisenberg. As Mike leaves with his $5 million, he informs Walt that he will continue making hazard payments to Gus's men out of his own money. He also advises Walt that the bugs planted in Hank's office must be removed before a sweep is performed by the DEA. Walt avoids Jesse's attempts to leave with his share of the money. Meanwhile, Mike learns through the bugs that the DEA has a search warrant for his house. He stashes a car with a go bag with cash, a passport, and a gun in an airport parking lot. When Hank and Gomez search his house, they find nothing. Later, Hank is told to end his surveillance of Mike due to budgetary considerations. Not being instructed otherwise, he decides to have Gomez follow Mike's attorney, Dan, who has been placing cash in various safe deposit boxes to facilitate the transfer of the hazard payments and to set aside money for Mike's granddaughter Kaylee. Gomez catches Dan in the act and apprehends him. Jesse confronts Walt and demands his share of the money. Walt becomes hostile and accuses Jesse of having nothing in his life, but his attempts to manipulate Jesse fail and he ultimately leaves without his money, angering Walt further. Walt is forced to cook his next batch of meth with Todd, who proves to be much more subordinate and better at following orders than Jesse. Pretending to be distraught over Skyler, Walt visits Hank at his office and manages to remove the bugs, but overhears Gomez telling Hank that they have arrested Dan and that he plans on telling everything he knows about Mike. Walt frantically calls Mike, who is at a park with Kaylee, and tells him the DEA is coming for him. Upon the arrival of the police, Mike is forced to flee the park without saying goodbye to his granddaughter. Mike asks Saul to retrieve the go bag for his getaway, but Saul fears the DEA will follow him. When Jesse volunteers to help, Mike refuses his assistance out of concern that Jesse would be spotted, leaving Walt to retrieve the bag. When Walt meets with Mike, he refuses to hand over the bag unless Mike tells him the names of the nine men he is paying off. Mike refuses and, angered by Walt's insistence that Mike owes him gratitude, proceeds to attack Walt's ego, insisting the entire situation could have been avoided if he had continued to work for Gus and had not killed him. Walt storms off momentarily, but then approaches Mike's car. Mike realizes his gun is missing from the go bag, just as Walt uses it to shoot him through his car window. Mike tries to get away, but \u2013 mortally wounded \u2013 ultimately resigns himself to sitting on a log by the river. After Walt catches up to him, Walt realizes he could have just asked Lydia for the names and that shooting Mike was unnecessary.

        "content": "After \"Normal\" aired, internet sources began to summarize the rules for True American, which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of True American came from a New Girl writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting \"JFK! FDR!\" and walking on chairs. As the cast did not understand the game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to \"have fun, dig in, jump in\" and play it as if \"they'd been playing this thing for years and years and years.\" The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming True American more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode. Fox subsequently released a set of official rules for the game, which can be summarized \"There are no real rules\". The characters also played True American in \"Cooler\", the 15th episode of the second season, in \"Mars Landing\", the 20th episode of the third season and in \"Wedding Eve\" the 21st episode of the fifth season."

Calling the film \"the most painful experience in my 30 years as a filmmaker,\" director Chung Ji-young wanted the audience to reflect on the theme of torture. He said he found the courage to make the film so that Korean viewers will \"engage with our sad history and the sacrifices of great people like Kim Geun-tae in a concrete, meaningful way. If we triumph over the past, we can move forward with unity and reconciliation.\""

Kim Jong-tae (Park Won-sang), 37, a prominent activist against the military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan and onetime commissioner of the Youth Federation for Democracy, is arrested and taken to a special interrogation facility in Namyeong-dong, a district in the center of Seoul synonymous with political torture in the 1970s and 80s because it was the location of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). During the first three days he is allowed no food or sleep and told to write an exhaustive essay on his life to date. On the fourth day, in order to find out why he resigned from the YFD, head interrogator Park Nam-eun (Myung Gye-nam) starts water torture, and on the next day waterboarding. On the sixth day, torture specialist Lee Du-han, known as \"The Undertaker\" (Lee Geung-young), starts a deadlier form of water torture, trying to get Jong-tae to admit he is a communist in league with North Korea. By the 11th day Jong-tae writes whatever they want him to, but Lee says it's full of inconsistencies and unusable in a court of law. The next day, after finding Jong-tae tried to smuggle out a note to his wife (Woo Hee-jin), Lee resumes a more painful version of water torture, as well as electric shocks."

He receives foolproof information that Khan and his nephew will be present at a local cinema theatre on a particular date, and he sets off to India to kill both of them. The story then moves in the present onto the life of a simple cook, Shekhar Bhatia, who is married to Dr. Kavita. Shekhar lives with his parents, his wife, and his younger brother Aryan. Aryan runs away one day from home, and Shekhar searches the whole city to find him. During his search, he witnesses Viren attacking the cinema theatre in which Khan is hidden, causing a stampede and decides to help the innocent people in the cinema. Whilst helping the innocent, Shekhar finds Khan's nephew fatally wounded and tries to rescue him. Viren witnesses this and mistakenly shoots Shekhar instead of Khan's nephew, thinking Shekhar to be Khan's man. Soon enough, Viren brutally murders Khan's nephew and flees the theatre. The wounded Shekhar dies. Aryan returns home and learns that Shekhar was murdered when he was set out to search for him. An enraged and shocked Aryan and his group of friends form a gang and kidnap Viren's entire family, including Abhir, with the idea of bringing Viren to them and seeking justice. Viren leaves no stone unturned to find out who dared do this. Each time he zeroes in on the gang, they manage to escape with the hostages. However, Abhir escapes and reaches his father. Aryan tries not to harm any of Viren's family members as he knows how precious a family is. However, Viren's wife suddenly dies when Abhir comes back to recover his family by himself with his gang, and accidentally shoots her while targeting Aryan. Viren believes Aryan is responsible for this. Aryan calls Viren to meet him at the same place where Viren killed Shekhar, along with the police. But the police decide to help Viren; thus, Aryan's plan fails. Aryan and his friends are taken into custody. After constant pleading by his daughter, a changed Viren decides to end it all and surrenders to the police. After cremating his wife, he also tells them to release Aryan and his friends, but the latter are so enraged that they set out to kill Viren. Viren, in the meantime, is in for the shock of his life when corrupt cops come out with the intention of killing him in an encounter at the behest of his own son Abhir, who apparently has now teamed up with Khan. An intense gun battle ensues between Viren, Aryan, and the gangsters, where Viren kills the corrupt cops, Khan, Syed, and Babubhai. Abhir tries to shoot his father, but Viren ends up killing Abhir. Viren demands that Aryan kill him now, but Aryan tells him that Viren's punishment is not death. Rather it is life itself, as Viren has nothing left to live for. He simply throws his gun and walks away, with a now apparently insane Viren looking on and muttering. The film ends on a note of karma, and Aryan, with his friends, is now managing Shekhar's canteen."

These two characters rarely pair up on the show, but \"through a common cause\" the writers were able to make it happen, \"and that cause became the welfare of a young teenage girl, who\u2019s both mourning the death of her hero father and praying for the return of her missing best friend\". On October 3, 2012, TV Line announced that Alex Kingston was cast as Miranda Pennebaker, described as a \"woman of questionable morals\". Showrunner Gary Glasberg noted that Kingston \"embodies everything I hoped for from this character. Heck, you might even see her again.\""

        "content": "In Billings, Montana, a police officer discovers Woody Grant walking dangerously on the shoulder of the roadway and takes him to the local police station. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money. After Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. Ross is especially frustrated because their Dad didn't put any effort into parenting them and used to drink a lot. He doesn't feel they 'owe' their father anything. David is visited by his ex-girlfriend, Noelle, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay and anger. While in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. The doctor wants to observe Woody for a day and when he hears about Woody's 'win' he says that'll cover the hospital fees. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway. They stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife Martha, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some drinks at a bar. Woody pressures David into having a beer. When David was six his Dad had let him drink beer thinking it harmless. David brings up Woody's alcoholism and problems within the family \u2014 with Woody implying that he fell into marriage and did not discuss having children with Kate; he just liked 'screwing' \u2014 they get into an argument. At another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's air compressor decades ago. But Woody previously said he had sold the garage to Ed. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire. Kate arrives by bus in Hawthorne, where David escorts his parents to the cemetery. Kate pays her respects there while providing some colorful history on Woody's relatives, particularly their sex lives. A local newspaper owner wants to run a story about Woody and his sweepstakes \"victory.\" She is an old girlfriend of Woody's and provides David with some background about his father. That night, Ed corners David in the men's room about some money Ed loaned Woody years ago that he wants back, threatening legal action. The rest of Woody's family, including Ross, come to visit him. Cole and Bart, along with others, approach David and Ross about their share of the money that they believe Woody owes them. A fight begins, ending abruptly with Kate calling out the relatives for their own unpaid debts. David, Kate, Ross and Woody tour the latter's childhood home, which has fallen into disrepair. They drive past a house Kate identifies as Ed's, so David and Ross conspire to steal back the air compressor. Kate soon realizes that the house actually belongs to another couple. She distracts the homeowners so David and Ross can quickly return the stolen compressor. At the bar, asking Woody for money, Ed reveals that Woody cheated on Kate before David's birth. As they leave, they are attacked by a masked Bart and Cole, who escape with the sweepstakes letter. They later tell David they threw it away after finding out it was a scam. Nevertheless, David and Woody go searching for it. They enter a bar where they find Ed reading the letter aloud to the other patrons, humiliating Woody. After Woody takes the letter back and goes outside, David punches Ed in the face. Woody has repeatedly said he wants to buy a truck with the money. He cannot drive any more, but Woody tells his son that he also wants to leave something for his family when he dies. David says that they are not going to Lincoln, at which point Woody collapses. David takes him to the hospital in Norfolk. In the middle of the night, Woody abruptly leaves and starts walking, so David relents and drives Woody to Lincoln. They arrive at the marketing agency, where they are told that Woody did not have the winning number. He is given a consolation gift of a hat that reads \"Prize Winner\". David goes to an auto dealership and trades in his Subaru for a late-model truck that his father always wanted, along with a new Craftsman air compressor. While driving back through Hawthorne, David lets Woody take the wheel for all to see, hiding below the dash to allow Woody to feel that his days of independence are not over yet. Among them is Woody's former flame who smiles at him, a nonplussed Ed with a black eye, and Woody's brother Albert. Woody waves goodbye and drives out of town, then stops in the middle of the road and switches seats with David, who takes them the rest of the way back home."

Gale, a man with a big heart, lives with an Indian woman, Alluna, and a girl, Necia, whom he treats like a daughter. In reality, Necia is the daughter of another Indian, Merridy, loved by Gale some time before, but who had married another. Bennett, her husband, had turned out to be a violent man and Merridy, trying to save her daughter from her abuse, had asked for help from Gale who had promised her to watch over the baby until she joined them after leaving her husband. But Merridy had never arrived and Gale had been charged with kidnapping the girl and murdering Merridy. Having escaped capture, Gale had gone into hiding, taking refuge in Flambeau. When the troops of the United States arrive in the city and, under the leadership of Lieutenant Burrell, create a fixed position of the army, Flambeau is all in fibrillation. Among the newcomers is also Bennett who now uses the name of Stark. The man, for fifteen years, has been on the trail of Gale and now he intends to have him arrested and to take Necia from him. Poleon, the French, who grew up with the girl, fell in love with her, but Necia prefers the lieutenant. Alluna, however, warns her that a white man will never marry a half-breed like her. Necia, after talking to Burrell who tells her that their separation would be the best thing for her, leaves with a broken heart. Gale decides to tell the lieutenant everything to ensure a future for Necia. Stark orders Burrell to arrest him, but he must confront the miner. From the clash, the two opponents both come out injured. At the end of his life, Stark says he has taken Necia. Poleon, who hears it, runs to the river to save the girl, arriving just in time. Burrell, meanwhile, obtains Stark's confession about Merridy's murder, thus exonerating Gale who is also found not guilty by the miners' committee for Stark's death. Poleon gallantly gives Necia to Burrell and leaves Flambeau in a canoe singing a song. [1]"

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of a 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". David Lee Dallas of Slant Magazine, wrote \"While the film charts its protagonist\u2019s gradual progression toward a renewed sense of agency and freedom, it rarely indulges in lengthy or even linear narrative arcs\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times said \"Moment by moment, it all adds up. The scenes of the family huddling and hugging, greeting and parting, and reaffirming primal bonds are quietly moving\". According to David Calhoun of Time Out, \"[Everyday is a] strangely intimate and powerful depiction of time passing and the peaks and troughs of childhood\". The A.V. Clubs Mike D'Angelo was not impressed by the film. He wrote \"For better and for worse-mostly for worse-it sticks to the mundane promise of its title\". Overseas, the critics were split. Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called the film \"strange and stirring\", while Peter Bradshaw of the same periodical called it \"Another great success for the endlessly creative and productive Winterbottom\". David Saxton of the Evening Standard called it an  \"average prison drama\". Reporting for The Irish Times, Donald Clarke wrote \"Utilising fluid shots of the English countryside set to one of Michael Nyman's most dynamic scores, Winterbottom makes something surprisingly lyrical of the non-story\"."

        "content": "The short focused on a boy named Pen (later renamed Finn in the television series) and a dog named Jake as they learn from the Rainicorn that the Ice King has kidnapped Princess Bubblegum, in the hope of marrying her. Declaring that it's \"Adventure Time\", Pen and Jake set off to the Ice King's mountain lair. Pen and the Ice King fight while Jake remains outside flirting with Lady Rainicorn, ignoring the battle. Just when Pen seems to be gaining the upper hand, the Ice King uses his \"frozen lightning bolts\" to freeze Pen in a block of ice. For unexplained reasons, this transports Pen's mind back in time, and to Mars, where he has a short motivational conversation with Abraham Lincoln. After being told to believe in himself, Pen's mind is returned to the present, where he breaks out of the ice, just in time to see the Ice King fly away with Princess Bubblegum. Chasing after him using Jake's extendable legs, Pen rescues the princess from the Ice King's grasp. Jake pushes the magical crown off the Ice King's head, thereby removing the King's source of power. The Ice King then plummets off screen, yelling a long list of complex threats of things he will do when he returns. The story closes with Princess Bubblegum giving Pen a kiss; he enjoys it, but is also greatly embarrassed by the act. He attempts to leave, but Jake claims that they have nowhere else to go and that there are no adventures that need them. However, some nearby ninjas are stealing an old man's diamonds, and they both run off in pursuit."

        "content": "Walking over a bridge on the way to his school in Bern, Raimund Gregorius, a Swiss professor of philosophy, notices a young woman in a red coat standing on the railing, about to leap. Dropping his briefcase, he runs and pulls her down. She helps him gather the papers that have spilled from his briefcase and accompanies him to the school where he teaches. But instead of waiting to talk, she leaves during the middle of his class, without her coat. Concerned, Raimund grabs the coat and runs after her, but in vain. He checks her pockets for identification. All he finds is a small book, a memoir of sorts, by Amadeu do Prado. It is stamped with the address of the bookstore where he happens to be a regular customer and he goes there. The bookseller remembers the girl's purchasing this obscure book and, as he leafs through it, a train ticket to Lisbon falls out. The train is, in fact, leaving in 15 minutes. Confused and doubtful, Raimund rushes to the station, but the woman is nowhere in sight. At the last moment he decides to use the ticket himself and jumps on the train. During the journey he reads the book. Amadeu do Prado lived in Lisbon, so Raimund searches for him, hoping that this will lead to the woman. He finds Amadeu's home, where the writer's sister, Adriana, welcomes Raimund; she gives him the impression her brother still lives there. Raimund learns that Amadeu was a doctor, and that only 100 copies of his book were printed after his death. When Raimund asks what happened to their father, Adriana's reaction is hostile. As Raimund is leaving, the maid informs him that he can find Amadeu in the town's cemetery. Raimund finds the tomb: Amadeu died in 1974. In the street, a cyclist runs into Raimund and smashes his glasses. While obtaining new glasses from a local optician, Mariana, Raimund narrates his experiences. When he returns to collect the glasses, Mariana tells Raimund her uncle knew Amadeu de Prado well and is willing to talk to Raimund. Raimund and Mariana both go to the nursing home where her uncle Jo\u00e3o E\u00e7a resides, and Raimund learns Jo\u00e3o and Amadeu were both in the resistance against the Salazar dictatorship. The story of their part in the resistance is told in flashbacks as the film continues. Raimund then visits the priest who taught and later buried Amadeu de Prado. The priest explains that Amadeu, an exceptionally smart young boy from an aristocratic background, befriended Jorge O'Kelly, another bright boy in the school although he was from a working class family. The boys bonded through their love for knowledge, particularly the philosophical and political knowledge not permitted under Salazar. Amadeu gave a graduation speech that reflected his contempt for the regime causing many of the families in the audience to walk out, much to the chagrin of his father, a well respected judge. Raimund returns to Adriana and asks for her side of the story, and then he revisits Jo\u00e3o to obtain more information. Raimund learns that Amadeu died of an aneurysm, which he knew he had, but had not told Adriana about. As a doctor, Amadeu never refused a patient, and when Mendes, a powerful member of Salazar's political police, called \"the Butcher of Lisbon\", was brought to Amadeu's clinic, he saved the man's life. Amadeu's friends were shocked by this, especially Jorge, who at that time was already in the resistance. Later, Amadeu confronted Jorge and declared that he too would join the resistance. Jorge introduced Amadeu to Jo\u00e3o and to his girlfriend Estef\u00e2nia, a beautiful woman with a photographic memory who helped the resistance by memorizing people's names and contact information. But Amadeu and Estef\u00e2nia were instantly attracted to each other. Jorge discovered that Estef\u00e2nia loved Amadeu and was crushed by her betrayal. When the revolution against Salazar began, Amadeu fled to Spain with Estef\u00e2nia but she refused his offer to start a new life together in Brazil. Raimund learned where she went to live and went there to find out if she was still alive. They talk and Raimund tells Estef\u00e2nia that Amadeu's death had nothing to do with her leaving Amadeu. The suicidal woman from the bridge in Bern has tracked Raimund down and waits for him in the lobby of his hotel in Lisbon. She came to thank Raimund for saving her life. She tells him that she felt suicidal because she had just learned from the book that her beloved grandfather was the Butcher of Lisbon, but she is learning to accept this. Raimund had brought with him the red coat she was wearing that day in Bern and he gives it back to her. The events have become a catalyst to Raimund's sedate life, in a gentle sort of way. Yet he informs the school that he will now return to his job. Mariana accompanies him to the railway station and, at the last moment, suggests that he could instead stay in Lisbon. The film ends with Raimund looking at Mariana with the train about to pull out of the station, leaving Raimund with time to leave or stay."

Lemere's widow, Ruby, approaches Gibbs, showing him a video message left behind by Lemere indicating that he might have been deliberately targeted. Abby's analysis of the bullet that killed Lemere appears to confirm this, after tracing the bullet to an American manufacturer. Gibbs suspects that the lead dog handler of a civilian contractor, Beta Co, might be responsible since he and Lemere had gotten in a fight previously, though they lack evidence to prove it. Ruby then receives a gold medallion in the mail, which is revealed to have been looted from Afghanistan. When a thief attempts to break into the Lemere household to steal the medallion, Dex chases the thief away. Gibbs and McGee decide to take Dex back to Afghanistan to investigate the crime scene while the rest of the team processes the evidence the thief left behind. DiNozzo and Ziva arrest the thief, who was using his contacts in Beta Co to smuggle looted Afghani artifacts into the US. Lemere stumbled onto the looting racket while he and Dex were clearing abandoned houses and refused the contractor's offer to assist them.  Gibbs confronts the Beta Co contractors, pointing out one of them was a former Special Forces marksman. The marksman draws his weapon on Gibbs, but Dex lunges and takes the bullet instead, before the marksman is shot dead by Gibbs. The surviving contractor is arrested for Lemere's murder. At Lemere's funeral, Gibbs approaches Ruby and tells her that due to the wounds he suffered, Dex has been permanently retired from the Marines, meaning he can stay with Ruby, much to her joy. The episode then ends with a phoof of Dex sitting by Ruby's side as the two study the coffin. Meanwhile, Director Vance is interviewing potential nannies to take care of his children but keeps rejecting the applicants. He confides in Ziva (whose father died in the same attack that killed Vance's wife) that he's afraid that if he hires a nanny, it will signify that he has moved on from his wife's death. Ziva tells Vance that only he can decide when to move on - let no one else dictate when he should. Inspired, Vance finally decides on which nanny to hire."

When Cyrus Stevens (Maxwell) receives a note that the gorilla will arrive at his home before midnight, he hires detectives Garrity (Frisco) and Mulligan (Gribbon) to help protect him. Stevens lives with his ward, Alice Denby (Lee), who is in love with Arthur Marsden (Pidgeon). Garrity and Mulligan stand guard outside the house until close to midnight, but do not see anything suspicious. Mulligan persuades Garrity to don a gorilla suit to entice the gorilla and trap him. To avoid being shot by those searching for the gorilla, Garrity wears a white ribbon around his neck. While Garrity searches for the gorilla, the real gorilla appears and chases Mulligan, who climbs a tree and calls for help, but no one arrives. The gorilla breaks off a branch of the tree and Mulligan falls to the ground. The gorilla then finds Garrity, who has hidden in another tree. He reaches for Garrity, but simply removes the white ribbon and places it around his own neck. The real gorilla then wanders freely, leaving Garrity, unable to remove his costume's head, hunted as the real gorilla. Garrity finally removes the head, but is still pursued and shot at in the dark until he reaches a lighted area. Marsden, who turns out to be an undercover detective, discovers that Stevens, in a gorilla suit of his own, is the real murderer."

When Wei visits Jing at his dormitory, however, she is told that Jing left for America. Unable to understand why Jing left so abruptly, Wei is confused and heartbroken. Back in her own dormitory, Wei becomes close friends with her three roommates: Ruan Guan, the most beautiful and popular girl in the class; Li Weijuan, a realistic girl who comes from a poor town but is determined to marry well; and Zhu Xiaobei, a tomboy. The four girls talk about their goals in life and all cheer to Ruan Guan's ambition\u2014to have a youth that never fades away. Wei is befriended by architecture majors Lao Zhang and his roommate Xu Kaiyang. Kaiyang comes from a well-to-do family and pursues Wei romantically, but Wei only regards him as a friend. One evening Wei goes to Lao Zhang and Kaiyang's dorm room to borrow a DVD. Wei is disgusted by the messy condition of the male dorm room, except for one bed that is neat and clean, which Lao Zhang says belongs to their roommate Chen Xiaozheng. Wei sees a building model on the table and fumbles with the parts. At this moment Xiaozheng comes back and yells out, \"What are you doing?\" Startled, Wei knocks the model off the table. Xiaozheng manages to save his model by shoving Wei out of the way, who falls in a mess on the floor. Enraged in humiliation, Wei angrily demands an apology from Xiaozheng, but Xiaozheng coolly replies that he has nothing to apologize for and that it was her fault for touching his model. From this moment, Wei is determined to repeatedly humiliate and pester Xiaozheng until she gets her apology. Through her attempts, Wei comes to the realization that she likes Xiaozheng. From Lao Zhang and Weijuan, Wei learns that Xiaozheng comes from a poor family and was raised by a strict mother, hence his disciplined personality. Wei declares her interest in Xiaozheng, and then relentlessly stalks Xiaozheng to get his attention, much to his annoyance. Eventually, Xiaozheng finds himself to like Wei too, and the two start dating. During the rest of their college life and relationship, Xiaozheng and Wei find that they have starkly contrasting personalities. Although he appreciates Wei's enthusiastic personality, Xiaozheng also reprimands Wei at times for her laid-back and undisciplined attitude towards her coursework. Wei asks Xiaozheng why he is always so serious about everything. Xiaozheng replies, \"My life is like a building that can only be built once, so I cannot afford any margin of error, not even a centimeter's width.\" Due to his family's modest financial circumstances, Xiaozheng feels that he needed to do everything he can to ensure the best possible professional future for himself. Eventually graduation comes upon Wei and Xiaozheng. At the on-campus recruitment and interview fair, Wei hopes she and Xiaozheng can work at the same company and thus remain together. Unbeknownst to Wei, Xiaozheng had applied to and obtained a graduate fellowship to study architecture in America. When Wei finally learns of his plan, she confronts Xiaozheng to ask why she was the last one to know. Xiaozheng explains that he could not tell her because he was afraid of hurting her and reiterates that he could not make any mistake in his life, so he had to make the choice to leave her to make a better future for himself. A few years later, Wei has become a mature professional who excels in her work, much different from her bygone youthful days. One day she suddenly encounters Lin Jing. Jing explains that he left abruptly then because he learned his father was having an affair with Wei's mother, so he could not face Wei. He never went to America, but avoided contact with Wei. The one time when he saw Wei on at her campus, she was happy with Xiaozheng. Now, however, he wants to come back and rekindle their friendship and romance. At the same time, Xiaozheng has also returned from America as an accomplished architect. Though he has everything professionally that he was determined to get, Xiaozheng finds his life to be empty. He deeply regrets letting go of Wei, realizing that his time with her was the only time he could be his true self, and thus he also wants to rekindle their relationship. However, Wei on their first meeting firmly rejects Xiaocheng. Not long afterward, Ruan Guan is killed in a car accident when trying to meet her university boyfriend one last time before she marries another man. Wei, in grief, asks Lin Jing to marry her. However, she later calls it off when Lin Jing tells Wei about another girl that loved him during their time apart. Afterwards, Xiaocheng and Wei meet once more at the aquarium to reminisce. There Xiaozheng asks Wei, \"Can I start over, and love you again?\" to which Wei replies, \"Xiaozheng, we spent our youth together, we owe each other nothing... youth is something you can only relive in memory.\""

Pest exterminator Archibald Snatcher strikes a deal with the city's leader Lord Portley-Rind to exterminate every Boxtroll in exchange for membership in the city's cheese-loving council called the White Hats, despite the fact that he himself is severely allergic to cheese. In actuality, the Boxtrolls are peaceful and emerge from underground at night to scavenge for discarded items with which to make useful inventions. A human boy named Eggs lives among them, cared for by a Boxtroll named Fish. As Eggs grows up, he becomes dismayed by the disappearing Boxtrolls seized by Snatcher. After Lord Portley-Rind's daughter Winnie sees Eggs with two Boxtrolls, Snatcher captures Fish. Eggs sneaks to the surface to find Fish and emerges in an annual fair to commemorate the disappearance of the \"Trubshaw Baby\" who was allegedly killed by Boxtrolls. Disgusted by the town's inaccurate portrayal of the creatures, Eggs follows Winnie. After a brief exchange, he asks her for directions to Snatcher's headquarters, located at an abandoned factory, where Eggs rescues Fish. They are caught in the escape. Snatcher recognizes Eggs as the Trubshaw Baby and reveals that all the captured Boxtrolls are building him a machine. Winnie, who covertly followed Eggs, overhears this exchange. She then helps Fish and Eggs escape from Snatcher and they take shelter in the Boxtrolls' caves, where Fish explains that Eggs' father had given him to them to protect him from Snatcher. Winnie agrees to help Eggs tell Portley-Rind the truth. At a ball held to commemorate the purchase of a giant cheese wheel called the Briehemoth, which was foolishly made using the funds for a children's hospital, Eggs tries to confront Portley-Rind, but is confronted by Snatcher (disguised as a woman named \"Madame Frou-Frou\"). Whilst trying to avoid Snatcher, Eggs inadvertently knocks the cheese wheel into a river. Eggs announces himself to the party as the Trubshaw Baby, but no one believes him, including Portley-Rind, who is too upset about losing the cheese wheel. Eggs tries to persuade the remaining Boxtrolls to flee for their own safety, but unknowingly demoralises them. Snatcher digs into the caves and captures them all. Eggs awakens to find his father Herbert Trubshaw a prisoner beside him. He sees the Boxtrolls stacked in a crusher and begs them to leave their boxes and run, but they are seemingly killed by the crusher. Snatcher drives his machine to Lord Portley-Rind's house, shows him the flattened boxes as proof of the Boxtrolls' extinction, and demands Portley-Rind's white hat in exchange for killing the last Boxtroll, which is actually Eggs disguised. The Boxtrolls, who have escaped from the crusher, free Eggs while Herbert reveals himself, causing Portley-Rind and the citizens to realize that Snatcher lied to them. With his plot exposed, Snatcher tries to take Portley-Rind's hat by force; two of his henchmen, Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles, turn against him and help the Boxtrolls disable the machine, which falls on Snatcher's right-hand man Mr. Gristle and crushes him to death. Eggs and Snatcher are thrown clear and land on the recovered Briehemoth, which triggers Snatcher's cheese allergy and causes him to swell to a grotesque size. He seizes Winnie and forces Lord Portley-Rind to give up his hat in exchange for her safety, but after tasting an aged cheese sample, his cheese allergy finally sets off and he explodes into pieces, killing him. With Snatcher's plot foiled, the townspeople and Boxtrolls agree to form a peaceful coexistence with each other. Winnie tells the tale of Snatcher's end to a crowd while Fish, Eggs and Herbert drive off in one of Herbert's contraptions."

Directed by Josh Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg, it stars Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell. Serving as a \"contemporary re-imagining\", the film follows a group of intelligent teenagers that build a transdimenssional portal, unintentionally leading them to gain superhuman abilities. It was the first Fantastic Four film that Bernd Eichinger did not produce due to his death in 2011. After Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) disappointed at the box office, Fox announced plans to reboot the franchise, and development of the film began in 2009. Trank was hired to direct in July 2012 and the principal characters were cast in January 2014. Principal photography began in May 2014 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and lasted for two months. Dissatisfied with the director's original cut, Fox executives mandated reshoots, which took place in January 2015. Fantastic Four premiered at Williamsburg Cinemas in New York City on August 4, 2015, and was released on August 7 in the United States. It was universally panned by critics and fans with criticism mostly aimed towards its dark tone, CGI quality, and writing. Many had also accused the film as an attempt by Fox to retain the Fantastic Four film rights compared to Roger Corman\u2019s  unreleased 1994 film. It grossed only $168 million worldwide against a production budget of $155 million, losing over $80 million and became a box office bomb. At the 36th Golden Raspberry Awards, it won several awards, including Worst Director and Worst Picture. Trank also voiced his displeasure with the final film, blaming it on studio interference. A sequel was scheduled for a June 9, 2017 release, but was cancelled after the first film's failure. It was also the third and final Fantastic Four film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, as the film rights reverted to Marvel Studios following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019. Another reboot, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is in development with Jon Watts helming the project."

The experiment is successful, and the facility's supervisor, Dr. Allen, plans to send a group from NASA to venture into a parallel dimension known as \"Planet Zero\".

Johnny and Sue have been outfitted with specialized suits designed to help them control their abilities. Reed is brought to Area 57, where Dr. Allen conscripts him into rebuilding the Quantum Gate in exchange for giving Reed the resources to find a cure. Arriving in Planet Zero, Dr. Allen's explorers find Victor, who has been fused to his spacesuit and now possesses telekinetic abilities, and bring him back to Earth. Believing that humans need to be destroyed so he can rebuild Earth in his image, Victor kills the scientists and soldiers in the base, including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm, and returns to Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate, with Ben, Johnny, Reed and Sue in pursuit. Now dubbing himself \"Doom\", Victor activates a portal on Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate and begins consuming the landscape of the Earth using a structure he created from the rock formations in Planet Zero. He is confronted by the four and, after a short battle, Ben punches Doom into the portal's energy beam, disintegrating him while Johnny closes the portal. Returning to Earth, the group is rewarded by the US military for their heroics by being given a new base of operations known as \"Central City\" to study their abilities without government interference. They decide to use their powers to help people and adopt the mantle of the \"Fantastic Four\"."

        "content": "Miles Teller as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic: Richards has been exploring the universe in his garage after school. He gains the ability to stretch his body into different forms and lengths. Teller said of the role, \"When I read the script, I didn't feel like I was reading this larger-than-life, incredible superhero tale. These are all very human people that end up having to become, I guess, what is known as the Fantastic Four. So for me it was just a really good story and gives me an opportunity to play something different from my own skin.\" Owen Judge portrays Reed as a child while Fernando Rivera portrays Reed in disguise. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm / Human Torch: A troublemaker,  thrill-seeker and the younger brother of Susan Storm,  he has the ability to shoot fireballs and fly. Jordan said of the cast, \"We're more or less a bunch of kids that had an accident and we have disabilities now that we have to cope with, and try to find a life afterwards \u2013 try to be as normal as we can.\" Jordan previously worked with Trank on 2012's Chronicle, and according to Trank, Jordan's character in Chronicle shares characteristics with Johnny Storm. Trank has described Storm as \"smart, hilarious and charismatic.\" Kate Mara as Sue Storm / Invisible Woman: Brilliant, independent, and sarcastic, Storm has the ability to become invisible and generate force-fields. Mara has said that she intended to focus on making her character \"as real as possible\". Trank has described Storm as \"smart, dignified and [with] integrity.\" Jamie Bell  as Ben Grimm / The Thing: Warm, sensitive, a loyal and protective friend, Grimm's stone body gives him super-strength and makes him \"indestructible\". Trank said Grimm grew up an alienated child in a \"tough\" neighborhood. Trank also said that Bell has \"qualities\" of warmth and strength which people would want to see from Grimm. Bell has said that Grimm is the \"heart of the group [Fantastic Four]\". In preparation for the motion-capture performance, Bell approached actor Andy Serkis for advice. During filming, he wore a tracking suit and stilts to match the height and eye-line of The Thing. Evan Hannemann portrays Grimm as a child. Toby Kebbell as Victor Von Doom / Doom: A computer technician and computer scientist who is mentored by Dr. Franklin Storm. Doom finds a new father of sorts in Storm. Angry, vengeful, and bright, Doom was changed in the Negative Zone, as were the other characters. Kebbell said that he concentrated the most on the voice of the character, adding, \"on the animated series, they never got his voice what I imagined it to be when I read the comics as a little boy. What I spent the majority of my time doing was not just being a fan, but being a bit of pedant and making sure I got exactly what I always wanted to see.\" Kinberg said that Doom is as central to the film as the \"titular\" heroes. He added that Doom has \"aspirations and struggles that are a little bit more classically tragic than the other characters\" and that the film would show how he becomes a villain. Dr. Doom's full name in this film was originally going to be \"Victor Domashev\", but after backlash by fans, it was changed back to \"Victor von Doom\" during reshoots, to match his name in the Marvel Comics universe. Reg E. Cathey as Dr. Franklin Storm: The biological father of Johnny and adoptive father to Sue. Cathey described Franklin as a \"brilliant scientist who has achieved much more than he thought he would\" and that Franklin's main drive in life is to help \"brilliant\" kids who may have been dropped through the cracks or who were misunderstood. Tim Blake Nelson as Dr. Harvey Allen: A scientist who works for the government and takes part in training the members of the team to hone their abilities. Nelson said that Allen is \"responsible for what the creative people do that he has to rein them in and discipline them.\" Additionally, Dan Castellaneta portrays Mr. Kenny, Reed's teacher and Tim Heidecker appears as Mr. Richards, Reed's stepfather. Chet Hanks, son of actor Tom Hanks, appears as Jimmy Grimm, Ben Grimm's older brother."

        "content": "John Ferguson, a whistleblower at Denning, a major pharmaceutical company, becomes disillusioned with the perceived lack of action taken against the company, murders several executives, and commits suicide as the police enter the building. Tom Miller, a paralegal assigned to the Denning case, subsequently loses confidence in the scheduled trial against Denning, as Ferguson was their star witness. Miller's boss criticizes his idealism as financially unsound, and when Miller writes an unsolicited memo on an unrelated case on the Gambizzi crime family, Alan Emmerich, one of the partners at the law firm, fires him. Roger, Miller's friend and a fellow paralegal, initially commiserates with Miller, but returns to the office in order to work late. Emmerich sends everyone else, including Miller's girlfriend, Anna, home early due to a technical problem with the firm's Internet access. As Miller leaves the building, he sees a man in a suit set down a briefcase. A different man then picks up the suitcase and enters an elevator.  Curious, Miller follows the man with the briefcase, only to see him produce a pistol from the briefcase and murder Janine, a lawyer. Panicked, Miller hides from the killer in the bathroom, where he discovers the body of a security guard. When he alerts Roger to the danger, Roger objects to Miller's plan to save Emmerich, as Roger does not believe that Emmerich would do the same for them. Regardless, Miller instructs Roger to contact the authorities as he tries to find Emmerich. Before Roger can make the call, the killer finds and strangles him. As Miller's recharging cell phone chimes, the killer realizes that there are more people left in the building than he anticipated. Miller uses his knowledge of the building's security to evade capture and eventually discovers Emmerich in an office with a woman who Emmerich identifies as Lorraine Gambizzi. When the killer breaks into the room, Gambizzi grabs a pistol, but the killer is able to shoot her first. Not noticing Miller, who hides, the killer spares Emmerich's life and orders him to stay in the office. When the killer leaves, Miller surmises that the killer is a Gambizzi hitman sent to kill Lorraine, who was going to testify against her husband. With her death, Miller hopes the killer will leave. However, the killer attempts to gain entry into the record room, a reinforced vault that Miller and Emmerich use as a safe room. Using Miller's recharged cell phone, the killer draws Anna back to the building and taunts Miller with this fact. The killer takes Anna hostage as soon as she arrives. Drawn out of the vault, Miller attempts to trade his access card for Anna's life, but the killer reneges on the deal, wounding Emmerich as he shoots at them. Now with access to the records, the killer starts a fire, only to realize that Miller tricked him into accepting a fake access card. Locked in the vault as the records burn, he chokes and falls unconscious. Miller enters the room to extinguish the fire, after which he realizes that the killer has recovered. As the killer beats Miller, Anna knocks him out with a fire extinguisher. Emmerich recovers the killer's pistol and fatally injures him. Before he dies, the killer whispers a code to Miller. Curious about the killer's last words, Miller investigates further and discovers that Emmerich likely targeted Roger for assassination because of his own whistleblowing about how the law firm was intending to throw the Denning case. When he confronts Emmerich, Emmerich begs him to destroy the evidence, as Emmerich believes the pharmaceutical company to be more powerful and ruthless than any crime family. When Miller refuses, Emmerich commits suicide. As Miller and Anna leave the building, the killer's earlier accomplice, now revealed to be a police officer, alerts his superiors, and a hitman outside the building radios that he has visual confirmation of Miller."

Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) sings \"Pretender\" in a Hit List number as Amanda's alter ego \"Nina\" performs for Sam Strickland's (Leslie Odom, Jr) manager character, who \"Nina\" is trying to get to be her manager. He introduces her to the Diva, played by Ana Vargas (Krysta Rodriguez), who fumbles her entrance and comes in late. Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) is concerned about Ana's mistakes. Derek talks about the show with Julia Houston (Debra Messing) (who's consulting) and Jimmy Collins (Jeremy Jordan). They all feel the show is missing something and aren't sure what. Jimmy, trying to keep the now deceased Kyle's spirit alive, doesn't want to change the writing. Derek publicly says that Ana, who's made several mistakes, needs a rest and decides to put in Daisy Parker (Mara Davi) (who is an old flame of Derek's and now in the ensemble) as the Diva for a night. Julia and Jimmy ponder that maybe the transfer to Broadway has lost a connection with the audience that existed in the off-Broadway show because of its smaller theaters. Ana is unhappy she's being replaced for the night and is suspicious of Derek's motives. Karen tells her she'll talk to Derek about it. When Ana tells her that Daisy was one of the women who accused Derek of sexual harassment the previous year, Karen confronts him about it. He divulges to her that after Daisy dropped the charges he went out with her a few times and during an intimate encounter, he promised her an understudy role in Hit List. The problem is that she filmed it and is blackmailing him with it and he says he doesn't have a choice. Karen is disgusted with him. Julia and Jimmy go to Jimmy and Kyle's apartment to check some of Kyle's notes for ideas. From an index card note, Julia remembers Kyle talking about wanting the audience to have a multimedia experience. They decide to put something in the show for that night's performance after the \"I'm Not Sorry\" number, basically tweeting the audience members and putting up a multimedia screen to engage them before the next number. Karen and Daisy perform \"I'm Not Sorry\" for Hit List, a performance that has \"Nina\" and the Diva performing at the Video Music Awards and trying to one-up each other. Eileen plans a Houston and Levitt tribute night for Tony voters to help get Bombshell some support for nominations. However, Julia is distracted with helping at Hit List and Tom is unhappy about it and word has got out that their partnership is splitting up. Tom, trying to get attention for his directing, turns the tribute into a cabaret revue that's more like an old time stripper show. He wants Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) to sing a song as a stripper. Ivy, having heard some gossip about several bad things she's done in her past, is afraid of anything that will put her in a bad light for Tony voters. However, she agrees to do it and performs \"Grin and Bear It\". Julia only makes it to the last part of the show but she and Tom sing \"The Right Regrets\". Afterwards, they hug and express regret about their fighting and Julia wonders if they really have to end their partnership. She's kind of scared since they've been partners for 11 years. He says maybe that's why the partnership needs to end. Jimmy wants more help with Hit List, but Julia tells him she was only consulting and helping with the transfer to Broadway and has to be loyal to and work on Bombshell. He is angry but tells her he understands. Karen and Ivy run into each other on the street and are friendly to each other. Ivy congratulates Karen on going to Broadway. Ivy then suggests that with the run up to the Tonys, they make every attempt not to stab each other in the back. Karen agrees. Ana, Derek and Karen are in a bar, and Derek tells the ladies that producer Jerry Rand loves Daisy as the Diva and wants her to remain in the role. Derek is unhappy about it but feels there's nothing he can do. He stalks off and passes Ivy without talking to her. Ana, who is angry about losing her job, asks Ivy about losing her Bombshell role early on after sleeping with Derek. Ivy is angry that Karen told Ana about that and confronts Karen about it. Karen says she's not trying to backstab Ivy, she told Ana because they are friends, and she thought everyone knew already. Ivy retorts that the only thing better than winning a Tony would be beating her for it and Karen decides to leave. Ivy then gets a call from her doctor's office telling her that she's pregnant"

        "content": "Jerry works at a bathtub factory, and lives in a modified apartment above a bowling alley with his dog, Bosco, and his cat, Mr. Whiskers. Jerry has schizophrenia, but chooses not to take his medication and enjoys delusions and hallucinations that manifest in the form of his pets talking to him. Bosco often represents his good intentions, while Mr. Whiskers represents his more violent nature. Jerry has a crush on his coworker Fiona, and asks her out on a date at a local Chinese dinner theater called Shi Shen. She agrees to go, but stands him up to go to a karaoke party with two other women from work, Lisa and Alison. Fiona's car doesn't start, leading her to flag down Jerry as he drives by. While driving her home, Jerry accidentally hits a deer, which crashes through his windshield. Jerry's hallucinations show the deer begging him to put it out of its misery. Jerry does as told, using a hunting knife to cut its throat. Terrified, Fiona runs off into the woods. Jerry chases her, still carrying the knife, and tries to explain, but ends up tripping over Fiona, and accidentally stabbing her. Jerry tearfully apologizes for hurting her and says that he loves her. To end her pain, Jerry stabs her again, and she dies. Upon returning home, Bosco suggests he go to the police and confess, while Mr. Whiskers says there is no shame in what he did, but insists Jerry needs to dispose of the body. Jerry collects Fiona's body but leaves a bloody shoe and pile of organs. He dismembers Fiona, packing her innards in numerous Tupperware containers and placing her severed head inside his fridge. As his delusions increase in intensity, Fiona's head comes to life and starts talking to him. Jerry attempts to apologize once again, but she rejects his apology, citing the good life she had before she died. Fiona then demands Jerry take his medication. Jerry takes his pills, and the next day, he experiences nightmares of his emotionally abusive father. When he wakes up his hallucinations have ended; his pets no longer speak to him, his apartment is a mess, with animal waste and garbage littering his living room, and blood stains all over his kitchen. Fiona's head no longer speaks and is foul and rotting. He throws away the pills in terror, and the next morning, his hallucinations return and his life is back to 'normal'. Fiona tries to convince Jerry to kill another person \"so she has a friend\". Jerry asks Lisa on a date. He takes her to his abandoned childhood home, where it is revealed his mother was mentally ill and was about to be institutionalized. When the authorities arrived, she decided to commit suicide by trying to slit her throat, but couldn't do it herself and so she begged Jerry to finish the job to end her suffering. The police found Jerry standing over his dead mother, and he was committed instead. Jerry sobs in front of Lisa, who comforts him. He leaves the knife he had intended to use to kill Lisa at his old house and they go to her place to spend the night together. The next day, wanting to surprise Jerry, Lisa goes to his house. She discovers the state of the apartment, including all the containers of organs and blood stains, becoming hysterical when she discovers Fiona's disembodied head on the coffee table. Despite pressure from Mr. Whiskers, Jerry refuses to kill her. Jerry tries to explain, but Lisa flees and locks herself in the bathroom. When Jerry breaks in, Lisa starts hitting him with a towel hanger and runs to his room. Jerry tries to calm her with an apology, which she seems to accept. When she tries to escape, Jerry throws her back into the room, accidentally breaking her neck, leaving her paralyzed and slowly dying. After she dies, Jerry dismembers her, placing her head in the fridge next to Fiona's. Other workers realize Fiona and Lisa have gone missing. When Alison goes to Jerry's house to investigate, Jerry kills her, taking her head as well. Jerry confesses his killings to his counselor Dr. Warren. She tries to call the police, but he takes her hostage and flees into the countryside, desperately wanting her to help him. She calms him down and shows understanding, seeming to make some progress with Jerry. Meanwhile, two other workers from accounting break into Jerry's home, letting Bosco escape through the front door, and immediately call the police. Shortly after Jerry returns home, still holding Warren hostage, the police surround his house and prepare to move in. Jerry flees down into the bowling alley, accidentally breaking a gas pipe while doing so. After rescuing Dr. Warren, the police are knocked back from an explosion caused by the gas leak. Jerry realizes the bowling alley is on fire and he is in grave danger. The voices of Bosco and Mr. Whiskers speak to him in his own mind. Mr. Whiskers insists that he get out of there and find another place to live, to hide, so that he may continue killing and feeling alive. However, Bosco tells him that there is no place for him in life any longer and that he should let the fire \"put him to sleep\". Choosing to stay and end his own misery, he lies down and waits until he blacks out and eventually dies from the smoke inhalation. In a white void, Bosco and Mr. Whiskers confess that, despite their opposing beliefs, they did like each other, before going their separate ways. Jerry then appears with his parents, Fiona, Lisa and Alison, and he apologizes to the women for killing them. Jesus appears, and they all dance and sing together. In the end, Jesus ascends Jerry in a forklift."

He recoils in disgust after seeing the images related to an open case, but Nicole advises him these are the types of images he will have to see every day and not look away from. Meanwhile, local contractor Matthew Lane picks up his 9-year-old daughter, Cassandra, after her figure skating practice. Matthew stops to pick up pie, leaving Cassandra in his truck. Minutes later, he returns to find her missing. He reports the abduction to the police station, where Jeffrey and Nicole are assigned to the case. They are skeptical of his story, which infuriates him. Cassandra's mother, Tina Lane, arrives and breaks down in rage at Matthew. Eight years later, Matthew and Tina are estranged; she blames him for Cassandra's disappearance. Nicole and Jeffrey are now romantically involved. Tina meets with the police regularly to discuss their case but Matthew, originally a suspect, has become a vigilante in the search for Cassandra. This entire time Cassandra has been held captive in the home of a child pornographer named Mika, who has installed remote cameras in the hotel rooms where Tina works as a chambermaid. Although Mika leaves his house to work and is no longer sexually interested in the now-teenaged Cassandra, the fear that he will harm her parents keeps Cassandra from escaping or seeking help. Jeffrey finds recent photos of Cassandra online. Mika makes her tell stories on camera to lure in younger children. Nicole poses as a child, which allows her and Jeffrey to catch a child molester named Willy, as well as a group of others. The arrests put Nicole into the public eye. Mika visits Willy in prison and urges him not to take any deals for cooperation. Willy says he will only comply if someone kidnaps Nicole and forces her to reveal what in her past may have inspired her to pursue child protection. Cassandra begins chatting online with a young girl, trying to entice her to meet. When Nicole arrives home, she finds Jeffrey using his own niece as bait to infiltrate the child porn community and immediately shuts off the web cam. Mika secretly turns the webcam back on to watch their fight and reconsiders Willy's offer regarding Nicole. Nicole attends a dinner held in her honor where she is drugged and kidnapped by Vicky, a woman working for Mika. While transporting trees in his truck, Matthew stays overnight at a motel.  He wakes to find the trees have been taken and left in a trail that ultimately leads him to a remote location where he finds Cassandra. Cassandra resists leaving with him and Matthew does not understand why until Mika appears and tranquilizes him; Mika had arranged the meeting to watch their reunion. Mika locks Nicole in a van and tells her to tell her story into a microphone. At the ice skating rink, Vicky questions Cassandra's former skating partner, Albert, about their history, pressuring him for details on how he was impacted by the disappearance. Matthew overhears this and follows Vicky to a restaurant, where he eavesdrops as Vicky plays a recording of her conversation with Albert for Mika. Matthew calls Jeffrey with their location and plants his phone's GPS on Mika's vehicle. Matthew goads the diner staff to call the police by being disruptive. He confronts the abductors to buy more time and steals Vicky's cell phone. She and Mika chase Matthew in their vehicle, shooting at his truck. Matthew escapes by driving by the diner again, where multiple police cars have responded to the staff's earlier calls. Jeffrey tracks Matthew's phone and locates Mika's house. Jeffrey is shot by Vicky before he kills her and fatally wounds Mika, who dies while being interrogated for Nicole's location. The Lane family is reunited at the police station and visit Jeffrey as he recovers in the hospital. The police finally find and rescue Nicole. Cassandra skates at her old ice rink and smiles."

        "content": "The Little Prince is a 2015 animated fantasy adventure drama film directed by Mark Osborne and based on the 1943 novella of the same name by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. The film stars the voices of Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Paul Rudd, Bud Cort, Marion Cotillard, Benicio del Toro, James Franco, Ricky Gervais, Paul Giamatti, Riley Osborne, Albert Brooks and Mackenzie Foy. It is the first adaptation as a full-length animated feature of The Little Prince. The film relates the story of the book using stop motion animation, which is woven into a computer animated framing narrative about a young girl who has just met the book's now-elderly aviator narrator, who tells her the story of his meeting with the Little Prince in the Sahara desert. The film's animation was provided by studios ON Animation Studios & Mikros Image. The film premiered on 22 May 2015 at the 68th Cannes Film Festival in an out-of-competition screening, followed by a wide release in France on 29 July by Paramount Pictures. The film was originally set to be released in theatres across the United States on 18 March 2016 before being dropped due to budget cuts; Netflix later acquired the U.S. distribution rights and released it on 5 August 2016. The film has received positive reviews, earning praise for its style of animation and homage paid to the source material, and earned $97.6\u00a0million on a \u20ac75\u00a0million budget, becoming the most successful French animated film abroad of all time."

        "content": "An ambitious young mother moves to a new neighborhood and imposes a coaching life plan for her daughter that leaves no time for leisure, all for her to enroll at the prestigious Werth Academy. The girl, however, becomes distracted by her elderly retired aviator neighbor, who tells her the story of the \"Little Prince\", claiming that he encountered him in the Sahara after crash-landing there. The aviator recounts the Little Prince asking him to draw a sheep. He drew two sheep (including a ram) before the Little Prince complained he needed a sheep that would live forever. The aviator drew a box with three holes saying that the sheep that he desired was inside it, which satisfied the Little Prince, much to the aviator's surprise. The girl and the aviator continue to read and play together without the mother's knowledge. The aviator tells the girl about the Little Prince's home, \"Asteroid B-612\", covered in baobab sprouts. He states that after clearing away the sprouts, the Little Prince discovered and found and nurtured a Rose into maturity. Despite becoming his friend, she was rather selfish and both too young to know how to love each other, which caused the Little Prince to travel to elsewhere with a flock of birds. During his journey, he meets adults that live on other asteroids, such as a king, a conceited man, and a wealthy businessman. The Little Prince eventually landed on Earth, meeting a snake who tells him where he is. The little Prince then meets and befriends a red fox. After a while, the fox bade goodbye to the Little Prince, advising him to always see with his heart. The aviator gives the girl a stuffed fox as a gift, telling her that he will leave soon to go find the Little Prince. The two decide to go out for her \"birthday\", but when they are pulled over by a police officer, the aviator is revealed to have no licence and the officer takes the girl home. Realising that she has not been following the plan, her infuriated mother redoubles her daughter's assignments. Nevertheless, the girl continues to read the story of the Little Prince, secretly visiting the aviator to find out the story's ending. The aviator tells her that the Little Prince had succumbed to a venomous snake bite to be reunited with his beloved Rose. Although the aviator assures her that he firmly believes the Little Prince succeeded, the girl, upset by the dark twist to the story, wishes that she had never met the aviator or heard the story. The girl tries to forget about the Little Prince, and focuses on her assignments. Towards the summer's end, the aviator is hospitalised. Deciding to put things right, the girl sets off in search of the Little Prince. Escaping out through her bedroom window to go to the aviator's yard, the girl, accompanied by her now-conscious stuffed fox.  The Little Prince's story pages, flies the aviator's now-fixed plane into space. They find all the stars mysteriously gone, all the while landing on an asteroid populated by workaholic adults owned by the Businessman from the Little Prince's story, who captures and holds all the stars to power his asteroid and belongings (including his employees). After encountering a police officer and an elevator operator who were the Conceited man and the King from the story.  they finally find the Little Prince, who has become an anxious, incompetent adult renamed \"Mr. Prince\" and works as a janitor for the Businessman, having no recollection or memory of his past. Mr. Prince accordingly takes the girl to an \"academy\" where she is to be \"reconditioned\" as an adult via a machine controlled by a tall, sinister Teacher. Recognising the drawing of his sheep's box from the aviator's pages, which he still keeps the original despite his amnesia, believing it could be important, Mr. Prince begins to regain his memories and saves the girl from the same fate that he had by putting the Teacher in the machine instead. They escape from the Businessman together and liberate all of the stars from his glass vault, which return to their rightful place in the sky. The girl and the fox then take Mr. Prince back to B-612, which is overgrown with dead, withered baobabs. They find the Rose dead, but seeing her image in the sunrise, the baobabs disappear and Mr. Prince turns back to his younger self, giving him renewed hope. The girl and the fox (once again an inanimate toy) return home, accompanied by another flock of birds. The next morning, the girl and her mother visit the aviator in the hospital. The girl apologises and presents him with the formerly loose pages bound together as a book, along with all the formerly missing parts filled in. The girl subsequently begins her studies at Werth Academy and reconciles with her mother. Both of them happily stargaze one night, while the Little Prince and the aviator are heard laughing joyfully together on Asteroid B-612."

Kansa arrives in the middle of a bar fight, when the sheriff, Corley, and his deputies defend themselves against local cowboy Swanee and his valet Meadows. Kansas manages to take the wrong side in the brawl. The commotion stops when Swanee's boss, John Thornton, and Mark Dawson from the Cattlemen's Protective Association arrive on the scene. Kansas is hired by Thornton as a cowboy and he returns with the rest of the cowboys to the ranch. Thornton's teenage daughter, Barbara, instantly falls in love with Kansas. He soon learns that this ranch and other ones that have refused to become members of the Cattlemen's Association, have been victims of vandalism. Kansas is therefore suspicious and decides to search Dawson's office for clues. He finds proof that Dawson has been taking money from the association for various unknown purposes. Unfortunately, Dawson walks in on Kansas when he is in the office, but he manages to escape and brings the proof with him. Dawson reports the break-in to the police and make them arrest Kansas. The other cowboys at the ranch rescues him from the town jail, and they know that he is a federal marshal undercover. Kansas deduces that Dawson and his men plan to rob the Cattlemen's money, $20,000 in total. With the help of the other cowboys, Kansas manages to take the box with all the money before Dawson gets it. Jailed for robbery, Kansas is rescued by Bolo, Meadows and Swanee, who know that he is a federal marshal. Dawson tries to frame Kansas, claiming that he has robbed the Cattlemen of its money. Again he tries to get Kansas arrested, but the other cowboys all testify on Kansas behalf. Having retrieved the money, Dawson plans to leave town, but the sheriff has got hold of the proof of Dawson's illegal activities and plans. Kansas and the three cowboys ride into town to confront Dawson and stop him, and meet him at the saloon. When Kansas' horse runs amok into the saloon, scared by gunfire, the rest of the cowboys manage to overpower and apprehend Dawson and hs men.

At her friend Allison's (Ellie Kemper) wedding, her boyfriend unexpectedly proposes. She also sees her father cheating on her mother. Shocked and confused, she flees and runs into teenager Annika (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) and her friends outside a grocery store. After buying them alcohol, Megan plays with their skateboard. When they ask her to join them on their night out, she does. Returning home, Megan's boyfriend suggests that rather than having a big wedding, they elope. Megan agrees, but delays the wedding by pretending she has a week-long career advice seminar to attend. Megan receives a call from Annika asking her to pretend to be her absentee mother at a guidance counsellor's meeting. Megan goes to the meeting, then asks Annika if, in return, she can stay at her house. Annika is unsuccessful at sneaking Megan into her house, where her single-parent lawyer father Craig (Sam Rockwell) questions Megan about her relationship with his daughter. Megan lies that there was a gap between her lease expiring and her move into a new apartment. Craig reluctantly allows her to stay and gradually begins to trust her. Annika asks Megan to drive her to her estranged mother's house to see her for the first time in years. Craig asks Megan out for a drink. When they return\u2014having had more drinks than they planned\u2014they end up having sex. The next morning, he offers to let her stay longer than the week she asked for, but she declines. Annika, seeing them kiss, tentatively tells Megan that she approves of the relationship. She then finds the engagement ring in Megan's purse. Megan tells her she's engaged, and that Craig has no idea. On the way home from shopping for Annika's prom dress, they begin arguing, and Patrick is distracted and crashes the car. He tells Megan he has been drinking the wine she bought for them because he is upset that his parents are sending him to boarding school. Feeling guilty, Megan tells the police she was the one driving the car. She still has alcohol on her breath from that morning, and is arrested. When Craig arrives to free her, Megan reveals her engagement and that she bought alcohol for his daughter. Megan's father picks her up at the police station. He says he has confessed his cheating to her mother and they are trying to work things out. Misty shows up at Megan's door with the white dress Megan bought and a few other things she'd left in Patrick's car, and tries to convince Megan to go to the prom. When Anthony comes to the door, they tell him Misty is a girl Megan was mentoring at the seminar. Once he goes back upstairs, Misty offers Megan a prom ticket and urges her to go for Annika's benefit. Megan continues to lie to her fianc\u00e9 about where she was for the past week. At the airport, he takes a selfie of them and sends it to their high school friends. Megan, realizing their relationship is stifling her, breaks up with him, unfriends her high school friends, and goes to Annika's prom, where she tells Annika to be honest and pursue Junior, a friend with whom she is in love. Megan goes to Craig's house and leaves him a box of wine with a note that says, 'Can we try again? Check [Yes] or [No]\". She knocks, then hides at the bottom of the steps. Craig answers the door, reads the note, sees Megan at the bottom of the steps, and closes the door. Not to be deterred, Megan knocks again, then picks up the house key hidden outside\u2014but before she can unlock the door, Craig opens it again and lets her in."

The performance of the feminine lead, Joan Weldon, is embarrassing in its inadequacy. Mr. Lovejoy makes an honest effort in a professional way, but the script is such a peachy morass he has no chance. That Lewis Seiler, the director, should fail so is more disappointing when one recalls his memorable Guadalcanal Diary''.\" Forget this fiasco, for it is one of those soggy melodramas that serve only to fill out double bills.\""

However, after some previews Universal Pictures  decided to remove the opening segment despite the audience's enthusiasm. Not wanting to waste the footage, the studio hired screenwriter Roy Chanslor to come up with additional material and Reginald LeBorg to direct a few new scenes, so that the episode could be released as a separate feature film. Duvivier's original episode was supposed to have ended tragically, but Universal insisted upon a few \"framing\" scenes wherein the refugee is shown to be innocent of the crimes for which he has been imprisoned, and which allowed a happy ending. Because the new footage had not only a different director but also a different cinematographer and art director, sharp-eyed viewers can easily tell the new scenes (which have the \"flat\" look of most of that era's Universal crime thrillers) from the Duvivier sequence, which is much more atmospheric and shadow-laden."

Meanwhile, Wade \"Unique\" Adams is caught using the girls' bathroom by Bree (Erinn Westbrook), and is forced to use the boys' bathroom from then on. In New York, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) rehearses \"You Are Woman, I Am Man\" from Funny Girl with her co-star, Paolo San Pablo (Ioan Gruffud), and surprises the director, Rupert Campion (Peter Facinelli), by wearing a wig during the performance, which he agrees fits the character. Rachel later tells Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) how it was positive for her to rebel a bit after Finn Hudson's death, and convinces Kurt that they should both get tattoos. In Lima, Principal Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is appalled by Will's assignment and bans twerking from McKinley High. Will refuses to accept this and performs \"Blurred Lines\" with New Directions and other students, misunderstanding the meaning of the song. Sue fires him, but he appeals to the school board by showing how several dances were, in their time, considered as controversial as twerking, and is reinstated. Unique is bullied while using the boys' bathroom and sings \"If I Were a Boy\" in frustration. She later asks Sue for a unisex bathroom, and Sue places a portable toilet in the middle of the choir room to get back at Will. He then volunteers to let Unique use the faculty bathroom every time she needs. Upon learning of this, Sue offers to give Unique her own key if Will ends the twerking assignment and cancels his plans to have them do it at Nationals, and Will grudgingly accepts Sue's proposal. Back in New York, Kurt is horrified to find out his tattoo is wrong, and that Rachel didn't get hers. He later confronts the tattoo artist (Bradford Tatum), who reveals Kurt misspelled it. He offers to fix it free of charge in order to motivate Kurt to not stop taking risks, and Kurt ends up getting a tongue piercing as well. Unbeknownst to him, Rachel did, in fact, get a tattoo, which spells \"Finn\". Back in Lima, Bree tells Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) that she had sex with Jake. Marley confronts Jake and breaks up with him when he confirms he has cheated on her with Bree. A heartbroken Marley then sings \"Wrecking Ball\". The following day, Will tells to the club about his deal with Sue, and Blaine announces he has found a perfect song for them to do that fits their style: they perform \"On Our Way\"."

He is banned from computers and touch-tone telephones until he is 18 years old. On his 18th birthday, he hacks into a local television station and changes the broadcast to an episode of The Outer Limits. Another hacker (handle \"Acid Burn\") counters Dade's attack. Dade identifies himself as \"Crash Override\". At school, Dade becomes part of a group of hackers: Ramon \"The Phantom Phreak\" Sanchez, Emmanuel \"Cereal Killer\" Goldstein, Paul \"Lord Nikon\" Cook (named for his photographic memory), Joey Pardella (a novice hacker without an alias and the youngest member) and Kate \"Acid Burn\" Libby \u2013 the hacker who kicked him out of the TV network earlier. Joey, out to prove his skills, breaks into \"The Gibson\", an Ellingson Mineral Corporation supercomputer. While downloading a garbage file as proof of his feat, his mother disconnects his computer leaving him with a fragmented file. However, his intrusion has been noticed and brought to the attention of computer security officer Eugene \"The Plague\" Belford, a former hacker. Plague realizes the garbage file being downloaded is a worm he himself inserted to defraud Ellingson. Claiming the file is the code to the \"Da Vinci\" computer virus that will capsize the company's oil tanker fleet, and pretending the hackers are to blame, he enlists the US Secret Service to recover the file. In fact, The Plague had inserted the \"Da Vinci\" virus as a red herring to cover for his worm. Joey is arrested and his computer searched, but he had hidden the disk containing the file. Dade and Kate make a bet, with Dade choosing a date with Kate should he win, and Kate having Dade perform menial computing tasks if she prevails. The hacking duel is to harass Secret Service Agent Richard Gill who was involved in Joey's arrest. After various hacks including canceling Gill's credit cards, creating a personal ad in his name, fabricating a criminal record, and changing his payroll status to \"deceased\", the duel remains a tie. Released on parole, Joey reveals the disk to Phreak who is arrested the next day and informs Kate the disk is hidden in a bathroom at school. Kate and Cereal Killer ask for Dade's help which he refuses as he has a record. He copies the disk so they have un-tampered evidence. Determining that Dade did not hack into Ellingson, The Plague sends him a powerful laptop with a request that he join him. He later threatens to have Dade's mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record. At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate's copy of the disk. Kate, Lord Nikon, Cereal Killer, and Dade learn that the code is a worm designed to salami-slice $25 million from Ellingson transactions, and that the Da Vinci virus is set to capsize the oil fleet the next day to provide cover and distract from the worm. Dade confesses that he gave Plague the disk and reveals his hacking history as \"Zero Cool\". Dade and Kate seek out Razor and Blade, producers of \"Hack the Planet\", a hacker-themed TV show. Lord Nikon and Cereal Killer learn that warrants for their arrest are to be executed at 9AM the next day. The next morning, Nikon and Cereal roller-blade from Washington Square Park, meeting up with Dade and Kate, while evading the Secret Service by hacking the traffic lights. Meeting up with Joey at Grand Central Terminal, they use payphones and acoustic couplers to hack the Gibson. At first, their attempts are easily rebuffed by Plague, who calls Dade to taunt him. Razor and Blade have contacted hackers around the world, who lend their support and distract Plague long enough for Joey to download the file. After crashing the Gibson, Dade and company are arrested. Dade surreptitiously informs Cereal Killer that he's tossed the disk in a trashcan. As Dade and Kate are being interrogated, Razor and Blade jam television signals and broadcast live video of Cereal Killer revealing the plot and Plague's complicity. Plague is arrested while attempting to flee to Japan. Their names cleared, Dade and Kate begin a relationship."

He saw the film as more than just about computer hacking but something much larger: \"In fact, to call hackers a counterculture makes it sound like they're a transitory thing; I think they're the next step in human evolution.\" He had been interested in hacking since the early 1980s. After the crackdown in the United States during 1989 and 1990, he decided to write a script about the subculture. For research, Moreu went to a meeting organized by the New York-based hacker magazine 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. There, he met Phiber Optik, a.k.a. Mark Abene, a 22-year-old hacker who spent most of 1994 in prison on hacking charges. Moreu also hung out with other young hackers being harassed by the government and began to figure out how it would translate into a film. He remembered, \"One guy was talking about how he'd done some really interesting stuff with a laptop and payphones and that cracked it for me, because it made it cinematic\". The character Eugene Belford uses Babbage as a pseudonym at the end of the film, a reference to Charles Babbage, an inventor of an early form of the computer. The fictional computer mainframe named the \"Gibson\" is a homage to cyberpunk author William Gibson and originator of the term \"Cyberspace\", first in his 1982 short story \"Burning Chrome\" and later in his 1984 book Neuromancer."

This gives him the courage to make his daydreams into a reality, which comes with some negative repercussions as Aiden's sense of justice might be considered warped. He gets robbed at gunpoint in a convenience store and after the assailant escapes and discards his gun, Aiden finds and keeps it. He begins a sexual relationship with Virginia and very quickly becomes obsessed with her. As the hired photographer at the 16th birthday party of the daughter of a wealthy but obnoxious businessman, Barry Endicott, Aiden spots him flirting and attempting to seduce some of the teenage guests. Aiden spies on and follows Endicott to a motel in Windsor, Ontario where he photographs him meeting for a sexual affair with one of his daughter's underage friends and Aiden later blackmails him. Aiden's  desires to be a hero and fantasies about killing people who annoy him start to concern him and he confides in his friend, Police supervisor Pete (Ron Perlman) who reassures him that everybody has these thoughts but doesn't follow through with them. While on a date with Virginia at a theatrical play performed by some of her friends, Aiden's thoughts become reality when he accidentally heckles them, embarrassing and angering Virginia who blocks him on social media and refuses to speak to him. Using the money he got from blackmailing Endicott, Aiden buys a gift for her but she rebuffs him, telling him that she feels uncomfortable around him and she needs space. He follows her to an industrial area where, to his disappointment, he finds that she has rekindled her relationship with her boyfriend Ravi (Edward Furlong). Aiden confronts Ravi and accidentally kills him but makes it look as though a homeless junkie killed him in a bad drug deal. A heartbroken Virginia discovers the crime scene and attends his funeral. Later on, Aiden and Virginia meet in the elevator of their building where he attempts to console her. After, in his apartment, he gets a knock at his door, presumably from Virginia."

        "content": "Lauzirika came up with the idea for Crave while working on an unrelated film, an adaptation of Phillip K Dick's I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon. Dick's daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, encouraged Lauzirika to make a smaller film before beginning the larger project and Lauzirika's former neighbor Robert Lawton pitched him the premise of Crave. The idea was that the film would be \"Travis Bickle meets Walter Mitty\" and Lauzirika and Lawton worked on developing the film's script and main character for two months, during which point each man wrote two drafts of the script. Lauzirika based part of Aiden's relationship with Virginia upon his own experiences, which he felt made the movie \"a little more interesting and a little more human\". He also chose to leave the film's ending deliberately ambiguous, as he did have a set interpretation of the ending but liked the idea of multiple interpretations as he feels that \"it\u2019s much more interesting to leave the theater with a question so people leave talking about it rather than having the answer handed to you on a silver platter\". Josh Lawson was brought in to portray Aiden, which Lauzirika felt made the character \"more human and likable\", which he believed made the character's interactions with Lung's character more explainable. Furlong was not initially considered for the role of Ravi, but was hired upon the recommendation of the movie's costume designer Oakley Stevenson. Crave was initially written and planned to be shot in New York City, but moved the film's setting and shooting location to Detroit due to Michigan's tax incentives for filmmakers. Lauzirika had some initial hesitations over this shift, but later felt that the move was appropriate as Detroit was \"a good match for Aiden\" and was very photogenic. Filming took place during late 2009, but experienced some setbacks during filming, as a scene that was to be set on the Detroit People Mover was canceled at the last minute due to concerns over the film's violent and sexual content."

        "content": "Six high school seniors head out to a secluded lake for a last day together. The seniors are: Johnny, a quiet type; Kitty, the aspiring actress who uses her looks to manipulate boys; Deb, Kitty's friend; Zeke, an obnoxious camera wielding geek; Matt, Kitty's jock boyfriend, and Simon, Matt's wild brother. While at the lake, Johnny meets an old man who knows his grandfather. The old man tells him that he should know better than to go on the lake but Johnny says they're just going to cross to the other shore and he'll show respect. The man agrees, but notes that Johnny's \"friends\" aren't the kind to respect the lake. The observation is proven correct when Johnny's friends ignore his pleas to stay in the boat and instead go swimming, thrashing about in the water, drinking, littering and playing with sparklers. They soon swim back to the boat after they feel a large object touching them underwater. They try to row back to shore but lose an oar in the water. As Deb reaches out to retrieve it, a giant fish bites her and she bleeds out and dies. The group tries to row to shore with one oar but the giant fish bites and destroys their remaining oar. In desperation, they throw Deb's body overboard to distract the fish and continue paddling using their hands; however, this is not successful and the group is left stranded on the lake, several hundred yards away from the shoreline. As the group panics, Kitty accuses Johnny of knowing about the fish because he tried to give her a necklace for protection earlier which she refused, thinking it was a love token. Zeke attempts to persuade the group to throw Johnny overboard. Disgusted with them, Johnny jumps overboard and begins swimming to shore but is pursued by the fish, and disappears underwater. Hysterical and desperate, Zeke is thrown overboard by an enraged Matt after accusing Kitty of sleeping with both brothers. His GoPro camera still recording, Zeke is seen being eaten by the fish, his arm with camera still attached is seen floating on the surface. From the shore, Johnny sets off in a motor boat to rescue the group, but after observing the fate of Zeke, he tells them he'll use a rope to tow the boat to safety. As he throws the rope, the fish bumps the boat causing it to spin and the rope catches around Johnny's neck, strangling him. Kitty is presented with an opportunity to save him by cutting the rope but she hesitates, resulting in Johnny's death. Kitty, Matt and Simon throw Johnny's body into the water as a distraction, but the fish refuses to eat him. The trio argue about Zeke's earlier insinuations regarding Kitty, and Matt angrily throws her into the lake. Kitty is denied entry on the boat, and she swims off. In a fit of madness, the brothers fight, and both end up falling into the water. Simon suffers a head injury, leaving drops of blood that attracts the fish; Matt, more concerned with his brothers safety than the fish, is kicked by Simon into the fish\u2019 path and is  eaten while Simon swims to shore. Meanwhile, Kitty observes Johnny's body floating nearby as she sits on the overturned motorboat. She takes the necklace he had previously offered to her off his neck and puts it on. The fish immediately goes to Johnny's body and consumes it. Believing the necklace will protect her, Kitty swims to the shore where she is confronted by a psychotic Simon, who drowns her in the shallows despite her pleas. As night descends, the bloodied Simon sees the old man in front of headlights. The man asks for Johnny and Simon replies that everyone is dead and he needs to get help. The old man states that Johnny was such a nice boy and that Simon needs to go back in the lake because it wasn't finished with him. Having seen Zeke's GoPro footage, and knowing what actually happened, the old man shoots at Simon several times until he goes back into the water. Simon tries to escape but is dragged underwater and devoured. Johnny's tooth necklace is seen washing ashore on the lake bed, covered with stains of blood."

One day Salvatore decides to move to Belgium to work in the coal mine of Waterschei as a Gastarbeiter. His family will stay in Italy as Salvatore will only be in Belgium for three years. He hopes to earn much money in a rather small timeframe so he can buy a forge for his son Rocco who is now still a 9-year-old boy. After a year, Salvatore decides his family should be with him, so they also move to Belgium. They soon discover the life of a gastarbeider is difficult: they have to live in some kind of barracks, they are neglected by the Belgian people and they do not earn much. They are astonished when they hear Salvatore signed a contract of five years and male children of gastarbeiders are ought to work in the mines as soon they leave high school. Rocco meets Helena, the daughter of the local grocer shop. However, the man is a racist and forbids his daughter to play with Italian boys. Ten years pass and Salvatore still works in the mines. They now live in a house they rent from the mine. Rocco takes accordion lessons. One day, he falls off his bicycle and his accordion is broken. His music teacher advises him to buy a new accordion, but Rocco's father refuses as he does not want to invest in the musical instrument. It turns out Rocco is a rather good mechanic and he gets an apprenticeship in the local automobile repair shop. Rocco's mother Ida earns some money by washing and ironing the clothes of other gastarbeiders. Salvatore, who is a selfish, jealous patriarch is unaware of Ida's job. Rocco uses his savings (as well as a part of Ida's money) to buy a new accordion. He can spend up to ten thousand Belgian francs, but the store owner (played by the real Rocco Granata) asks 25 000 francs for the accordion he wants to buy. However, after Rocco plays him some songs, the store owner is impressed and agrees to let Rocco buy the instrument on credit. Rocco once again meets Helena. She convinces Rocco to enter a talent contest. Rocco wins, but then Helena, unaware of his secret, tells Salvatore where his son got the money. Salvatore is furious and forbids his son to play the accordion. However, Rocco sneakily goes to pubs and bars to play with his music group \"The International Quintet\". One day, the group is arrested by the police as they do not have a \"professional card\". Rocco requests such card from the Ministry, but this is refused as he is the son of a gastarbeider. Rocco then asks a con man to make him fake cards. Meanwhile, Helena has started a relationship with Renaat, a rich snob. Both want to go to the university in Leuven. One day, Rocco has to check the car of Renaat, but he forgets to fill the oil. The car breaks down and the owner of the automobile repair shop puts and end to Rocco's apprenticeship. Helena realizes she does not love Renaat and she ends the relationship. She meets with Rocco and they sleep together. Renaat watches as Rocco leaves. The next morning, Rocco goes to a recording studio to record a single (a promoter was in attendance at a performance of \"The International Quintet\" and wants to record their song \"Manuela\", and the song \"Marina\" will be recorded for the B-side). When Rocco returns  home, he is arrested by the police as he is identified as the wrongdoer who raped Helena the night before. Although he proclaims his innocence the police do not believe him. Only after two witnesses declare Rocco did not rape Helena (Renaat was the wrongdoer), he is set free. Some time later, Rocco wants to visit Helena but she has moved to live with her aunt in the United States. There is also more bad news: the recording company does not want to release the single as \"nobody is interested in a boy playing the accordion\". Rocco decides to buy all the singles to distribute them in Waterschei himself. His father is still angry as he does not want his son to be a professional musician. Some days later, Salvatore is involved in an occupational injury and hurts his leg. After he wakes up, it seems he also has tinnitus. The board of the mine decides Salvatore can't work anymore in the mines due to the tinnitus. He will get a disability allowance for six months; after that he also has to leave the house. The board will pay for the incident with the leg, but claim they are not responsible for the tinnitus. The song Marina becomes an unexpected international success. Rocco heads to the US to promote his songs. During a performance in Carnegie Hall, he forgives his father who now is proud of his son. There is also an unexpected attendee in the audience: Helena."

Her standing complaint about Alan as a boyfriend has been that he sees life as one long rehearsal. This is exacerbated by the fact that, even with a now-steady job and dealing with strange passenger/clients, Alan rehearses his comedy at every opportunity and deals with bizarre situations with good-natured aplomb. He and his buddy Jay become involved the shady dealings of businessman Bradley Coleman, which results in a chase through Los Angeles with both sides of the law in pursuit. Eventually, things come to a head when he loses Bradley at a galleria, forcing him to go back and look for him just as he's about to perform a stand-up routine at the Laff Track. Unfortunately, he and Julie, who had followed him, end up being pursued by the mobsters.

They return to the Laff Track just in time for him to perform his routine, and Bradley reveals that he had gotten his goods legitimately through an inheritance and wanted to donate them before the IRS caught wind. During the routine, Alan stumbles when he sees the mobsters who had been pursuing him and stolen his limo at the cemetery have followed him to the Laff Track, triggering a brawl that he, Julie, Jay, and Bradley barely escape with their lives, but not before Alan schedules an appointment with network executives who had seen his act. When the police arrive, Alan indicates the men they came for, one of whom pathetically tries to pin it all on his partner. Later, Alan reveals to Julie everything involving Bradley's dealings, including his dropping the goods off at the post office between the funeral and his stand-up routine for safekeeping until he could get them back to Bradley.

As Lucas is taken to the hospital, Jon meets a man named Don, who explains that Lucas was the keyboardist for a band called The Soronprfbs, which Don manages. Jon mentions that he plays keyboards and is invited to perform with them that night. The rest of the band - drummer Nana, synthesizer and theremin player Clara, French guitarist Baraque, and lead vocalist Frank - are reluctant to accept him except for Frank, who always wears a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask over his head. Their performance abruptly ends when Clara storms off the stage after being shocked by an electrical fault. Frank invites Jon to become a full-time member of the band. He agrees and accompanies them to Ireland to spend a year in a remote cabin while they work on recording their debut album. One day, Don confesses to Jon that he feels he cannot live up to Frank's prowess. The next day, Don reveals he has not paid the cabin's rent and that they are being evicted, but Jon offers to pay what is owed using his grandfather's inheritance. After completing the album, the band finds what appears to be Frank's corpse hanging from a tree, but once they remove the mask, they discover it is actually Don. They cremate him, and Clara reveals to Jon that Don was the first keyboardist of the band. Jon reveals that he has been secretly uploading the band's recording sessions on social media, and that The Soronprfbs have gained a small fan following and have been invited to perform at South by Southwest. Most of the band is offended by Jon's clandestine promotion of them, but Frank, excited by the prospect of a large audience, agrees to go to the festival. Clara confronts Jon as the latter is soaking in the hot tub, expressing contempt for his growing influence over Frank. The ensuing argument culminates in them having angry sex, and Clara threatens to stab him if the trip to America goes awry. Upon arrival in Texas, they stop to scatter Don's ashes, but realize Baraque accidentally brought powdered food instead of the ashes. The band begins to have arguments over creative differences leading up to the performance. Clara and Frank disappear shortly before the concert and Jon finds them in an alley, where Clara is helping Frank stave off a mental breakdown. Jon tries to get Frank to go back to the festival with him, prompting Clara to stab him in the leg as promised. After she is arrested, Jon uses the scandal to build publicity for the band. The night before the concert, Nana and Baraque reveal their disdain for Jon's selfish ambitions and quit the band. Jon and Frank go onstage by themselves in spite of Frank's deteriorating mental health. When Jon tries to begin the set with one of his own songs rather than one from the album, Frank has a breakdown and collapses on stage. They move into a cheap motel together, where a frustrated Jon tries to forcibly unmask Frank. Frank tries to escape and is hit by a car, smashing the fake head. He flees before Jon can see his real face. Some time later, Jon visits a dive bar where Clara, Nana, and Baraque are playing as a trio, and apologizes to them for having taken control of the band. After numerous failed attempts, he finally succeeds in tracking Frank to his hometown of Bluff City, Kansas, where he is living with his parents. Jon finally sees Frank's face to find that he is scarred and balding from prolonged use of the mask. They explain that Frank has suffered from severe mental health issues all his life and began wearing the mask when he was a teenager after his dad made it for him for an alleged costume party, but that he has always been musically talented. Frank declares he has been unable to make music since the band fell apart. Jon takes Frank to the dive bar where the rest of the band is playing, where they quickly realize who he is. He begins to sing and they join him. With the original Soronprfbs restored, Jon leaves the bar alone."

Over an undetermined period, Hershel (Scott Wilson) helps Rick (Andrew Lincoln) to recognize that he has taken a violent, callous attitude towards protecting his group, and reminds him of how this has impressed on his son Carl (Chandler Riggs), nor allowed him to spend time with his infant daughter Judith. Rick comes to take Hershel's advice, and these scenes end with Rick deciding to put down his gun, take up farming alongside Carl, and enjoy time with the members of his group. In the present, Rick, Carl, and Michonne (Danai Gurira) follow signs along the tracks to Terminus. They hear cries for help and find a lone survivor surrounded by walkers. Rick warns them about conserving their ammunition and determines there is too much to risk in saving the man, leaving him to die. That night, they are ambushed by Joe (Jeff Kober) and his gang of Claimers, whose number also includes the reluctant Daryl (Norman Reedus). Joe had been tracking Rick's group for some time, seeking revenge on Rick for killing one of his own. Joe holds Rick at gunpoint, and Daryl (who was unaware it was Rick's group being tracked) tries to convince Joe to not harm his friends. Joe refuses Daryl and has two of his men secure him before turning his attention back to Rick. Joe says that the Claimers are \"reasonable men\", but in revenge, he will have Daryl beaten to death, sexually assault Carl and Michonne, and then kill Rick after he is forced to witness this. One Claimer, Dan (Keith Brooks), prepares to rape Carl. Instinctively, Rick headbutts Joe, who fires his gun but misses, but the shot leaves Rick temporarily deaf. Joe wrestles and secures Rick, but Rick then bites into Joe's carotid artery and rips out his jugular vein, killing him and shocking the other Claimers. Daryl and Michonne use the moment to break free of their captors, killing the rest of the Claimers except Dan. Dan pleads for his life, but Rick stabs him with Joe's pocketknife and disembowels him, and then continues to stab him to death repeatedly, as Carl watches. Rick makes sure the others are safe, and he and Daryl reconcile, and Daryl explains that he got separated from Beth and is unaware of her fate. Later, the four continue towards Terminus and soon come in sight of the train yard. Rick is concerned and decides to bury most of their weapons nearby before they enter. They are greeted at Terminus by brothers Gareth (Andrew J. West) and Alex (Tate Ellington), and they check their weapons before returning them to the group. Alex provides them with a tour of Terminus, providing them with food from their mother Mary (Denise Crosby). Rick notices inside Alex\u2019s cargo pants pocket the silver chain of the pocketwatch that Hershel had given to Glenn (Steven Yeun) as his sign of approval for marrying his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan). Rick takes Alex at gunpoint and demands to know where he found the pocket watch. Gareth, observing from a distance, orders his men to attack, starting a large firefight. Rick uses Alex as a bullet shield, before he and the others are forced into a series of alleyways, and eventually into a closed-in area, where they have nowhere to hide from snipers. Gareth demands they drop their weapons, and the group is escorted into a boxcar where they find that the Terminus residents have already captured Glenn, Maggie, Bob (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.), and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green), along with new allies Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz), Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos), Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt), and Tara Chambler (Alanna Masterson). When they are locked in, Rick tells the others that \"They're screwing with the wrong people.\""

It marks the final episode to feature Hershel Greene, although in a flashback sequence, following the character's death in \"Too Far Gone\". For this episode, Scott Wilson is readded to the opening credits after being removed after the ninth episode of the season. The episode marks the final appearance of recurring character Joe (played by Jeff Kober) as he was killed by Rick Grimes by biting out his jugular vein. The scene where Rick, Michonne and Carl are captured by Joe's gang was intentionally shot and produced to follow a certain portion of the plotline in \"Volume 10\", \"Issue #57\" of the comic book series. The main difference is in the comics, Rick, Carl, and Abraham are captured by three bandits, whereas in the show, Rick, Carl, and Michonne are captured by Joe's gang of five men. During filming of the final scene, Andrew Lincoln remarked that he delivered the final line which was very close to the one found in \"Volume #11\", \"Issue #64\" of the comic book series. Scott Gimple noted that this would never have passed the network censors, so they had to re-take another version of the final scene without the swearing. Despite this, the scene with the swearing is considered the canonical version. The home video release of the episode shows the uncensored version of the final line of the season, \"They're fucking with the wrong people.\""

        "content": "David is escorted to a hotel after his wife leaves him for another man. The hotel manager reveals that single people have 45 days to find a partner or they will be transformed into an animal of their choice; the dog accompanying David is his brother. David chooses to become a lobster should he fail. David makes the acquaintance of Robert, a man with a lisp, and John, a man with a limp. Guests are fixated on finding a mate with whom they share superficial traits such as minor ailments, which they believe to be the key to compatibility. The hotel has many rules and rituals: masturbation is banned, but sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory, and guests attend dances and watch propaganda extolling the advantages of partnership. Residents can extend their deadline by hunting and tranquilizing the single people who live in the forest; each captured \"loner\" earns them a day. On one hunt, a woman with a fondness for biscuits offers David sexual favours, which he declines. She tells him that if she fails to find a mate, she will kill herself by jumping from a hotel window. John wins the affections of a woman with constant nosebleeds by purposely smashing his nose in secret. They move to the couples' section to begin a month-long trial partnership. David later decides to court a notoriously cruel woman who has tranquilized more loners than anyone else. Their initial conversation is accompanied by the screams of the biscuit-loving woman, who has injured herself by jumping from a first floor window. David pretends to enjoy the woman's suffering to gain the heartless woman's interest. He later joins her in a jacuzzi where she feigns choking on an olive to test him. Noticing that he makes no attempt to help her, she decides that they are a match, and the two are shifted to the couples' suite. David wakes up one morning and finds that she has kicked his brother (his dog) to death. As David cries in response to losing his canine sibling, she concludes that their relationship is a lie and attempts to drag him to the hotel manager to have him punished. However, he escapes and, with the help of a sympathetic maid (who is later revealed to be a mole working for the loners), tranquilizes his partner and transforms her into an unspecified animal. David escapes the hotel and joins the loners in the woods. In contrast to the hotel, they forbid any kind of romance, which is punishable by mutilation. David, who is short-sighted, begins a secret relationship with a woman who is also short-sighted. They develop a gestural language they use to communicate. They are taken on covert missions to the nearby city, where their cover requires them to appear as husband and wife, which they secretly enjoy. The loners launch a raid to sabotage the hotel. David tells the woman with nosebleeds that John has been faking his. Other loners hold the hotel manager and her husband at gunpoint, tricking him into shooting his wife to save himself, but the gun is not loaded. They leave the couple to face each other. The leader of the loners obtains the short-sighted woman's journal and discovers her plan to escape with David. The leader takes the woman to the city, apparently to have an operation to cure her short-sightedness, but instead has her blinded. David and the woman try to find something else that they have in common, to no avail. One morning, David overpowers the leader, leaving her tied up in an open grave to be eaten alive by wild dogs. He and the blind woman escape to the city and stop at a restaurant. David goes to the restroom and hesitantly prepares to blind himself with a steak knife but hesitates twice and his decision is left unshown."

Hector is captured alive at the behest of the police chief and is executed live on television after a brief show trial. Bone, who has recently lost his job at a cryogenics facility for not showing the proper respect to authority, meets Helen, a woman forced into prostitution at the government-sanctioned whorehouse. They are immediately attracted to each other and begin an illegal romance despite several close calls with the police. Bone's friend Creon becomes jealous of their relationship and demands that Bone share Helen with him; disgusted, Bone refuses, and they eventually come to blows over Creon's behavior. After he observes Bone and Helen engage in petty theft, a mysterious man named Jason offers them passage to Frodan if they will steal records from a secure facility disguised as a hospital. Although suspicious, they accept and successfully deliver the information to Jason, who attempts to delay their reward and talk them into further criminal acts. Frustrated and needing money, Bone and Helen rob a bank, quickly becoming the most wanted criminals in Soleil. Creon attempts to blackmail Helen, but she dismisses his threats; before Creon can attack her, Bone saves her and tells Creon that he would kill him if he weren't leaving Soleil so soon. After losing faith in Jason's promises, Bone and Helen recruit J.D. and Alexi to help them escape. On the run, Helen and Bone hide out in the plague zone, where they encounter Jason, who is revealed to be a government agent. Jason explains that the government long ago ended any major crime in Soleil, and it is his job to recruit citizens to go on government-sponsored crime sprees that validate the powers of the police state. Helen and Bone briefly take Jason hostage, then flee to a safer location, where they discuss plans to rob upper class citizens stored in the cryogenics facility and hijack military helicopters that Alexi can pilot to Frodan. Creon bullies J.D. into betraying Bone and Helen to the police, with whom he has made a deal. Bone kills his former boss at the facility, and Creon tries to take Helen hostage. However, the police arrive and betray Creon, as Helen warned him they would. Creon takes J.D. and Alexi hostage; when J.D. mocks him, Creon murders J.D. At the military base, Helen and Bone, who escaped the facility, free Alexi and use Creon as a distraction as they hijack a helicopter. Creon begs to be taken with them, but they leave him behind for Jason to kill. Alexi flies Helen and Bone to Frodan, where they triumphantly land and celebrate their freedom. However, Frodan appears deserted, and Jason is waiting for them at the airfield. Jason casually murders Alexi and a police witness, then thanks Bone for making his plans possible. Jason reveals that everything has been a lie: Frodan is a radioactive wasteland, and the war ended twenty years ago; the \"plague zone\" is actually radiation that has drifted to Soleil. Jason knows too much for his position to be secure, and the information that Bone retrieved for him is his insurance. Jason allows Bone and Helen to escape, telling them that their continued threat justifies Soleil's military expenditures. Jason goes back to Soleil, while Helen and Bone start roaming and walking Frodan's land, searching for a new hope."

The graduate board reluctantly gives her a grant, with the help of Sally, one of her friends on the graduate board. Sally pushes for her approval. Elizabeth spends the next few months continuously chatting with strangers, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend, Damien, and friends Jenni and Max. Though most of her chats are quickly ended due to sexual content or scams, she accumulates plenty of data and is optimistic about the outcome of the project. While in the company of Jenni and chatting with strangers, Elizabeth encounters a woman whose webcam appears to be broken. The stranger reacts aggressively to Jenni when Elizabeth is away from the webcam, and Jenni logs off. Afterwards, Elizabeth's account is hacked, and her webcam is repeatedly turned on without her permission. The stranger attempts to chat with Elizabeth again the next day while she is in a coffee shop, but logs off quickly when another customer approaches the webcam. That night, Damien surprises Elizabeth by showing up to her home in the middle of the night. Elizabeth's hacked webcam records the couple having sex, before the hacker sends the video to Elizabeth's graduate board. Later, Elizabeth is prompted to chat with the stranger again; the stranger reveals that they witnessed Elizabeth having sex. Later still, their webcam turns on and reveals the account holder bound and gagged. She is murdered on-screen by a masked man. Elizabeth is shaken and immediately takes the video of the murder to the police. The police acknowledge that the video appears genuine, but advise her that such snuff films are usually faked. They also report that there is little they can do about it. Elizabeth later stumbles upon a disturbingly realistic depiction of a death during a game of Russian roulette, which turns out to be faked. Her friends, including the computer scientist Max, insist that the video is a hoax. Elizabeth remains unconvinced and is determined to solve the murder. However, both the police and other users of The Den turn out to be unhelpful. When she enlists Max to hack the account and to see where it originated, he finds that it has been routed through countless proxies. This makes the video untraceable. Damien is abducted while chatting with Elizabeth. She has her back turned at the moment of his kidnapping, and does not realize that he is missing until later. She eventually receives a bizarre call from his computer, which depicts his house completely empty. Though Elizabeth implores the police to investigate, they tell her that there is nothing that they can do. Meanwhile, Jenni is lured to Elizabeth's house by the hacker, who pretends to be Elizabeth. The hacker abducts Jenni when she arrives. While harried from trying to find a way to reach Damien, Elizabeth receives an angry call from Sally. Sally informs Elizabeth that the video of her and Damien having sex was sent to the entire graduate board. Sally does not believe Elizabeth, when the latter insists that she was hacked. Sally informs her that her grant is suspended until further notice. Later, while trying to reach Jenni, Elizabeth is lured to Jenni's house, where she finds the power cut. Seeing water flooding from the bathroom, Elizabeth enters to find Jenni in the bathtub, her wrists slashed in an apparent suicide attempt. Though Jenni is alive when Elizabeth finds her, she dies soon after. Elizabeth finds a suicide note emailed to her, ostensibly from the hacker posing as Jenni. Elizabeth is further shaken when she receives a message showing the attackers stalking and entering a home owned by Lynn, Elizabeth's pregnant sister. Though Elizabeth notifies the police and calls Lynn to warn her, the message is garbled. The attackers bind Lynn and prepare to cut open her stomach. But then abruptly leave, hiding the camera as they do so. Later, when the house is surrounded by police, one of the attackers returns and picks up the camera. This reveals that they are either part of law enforcement or posing as a police officer. The attacker fixates on the father of Lynn's child, who she is separated from. The attacker leaves and gets into a car. He follows Elizabeth back to her home, where she is packing in preparation to keep her sister company. She receives a chat request from Max, which shows the lead detective entering Max's house, and being murdered on-screen while there. Elizabeth calls for help from the officer guarding her, but she finds him murdered as well. She is attacked by a hooded figure hidden in her closet, but she stabs him repeatedly and flees. She is then apprehended by another hooded attacker, who was waiting outside. Elizabeth awakens in a room of a nightmarish, abandoned complex. She is chained to a wall, with a GoPro stapled to her forehead. A computer is in the room, forcing her to chat with the abducted Damien. He informs her that there are many other attackers. She is also shown a recorded video of Max being strangled with plastic wrap by the killers. Damien is then beaten and taken away to presumably be killed off-screen. Afterwards, another hooded man enters the room with Elizabeth, preparing to kill her. She overpowers him and strangles him with her chain. Unlocking her shackles with his keys, she attempts to escape the dark complex. She is only armed with a discarded hammer. She is chased by a number of killers, one of whom is a young man. She attacks this man, demanding to know where Damien is; he tells her that he is not there. She manages to escape to above ground, bludgeoning other attackers. She hijacks one of their cars, but crashes when blindsided by another member's car. She is removed from the wreck by the killers, and dragged back to the complex. The film cuts to another woman, Brianne, on The Den who chatted with Elizabeth at the start of the project. Much like Elizabeth's first interaction with the killers, she is lured to chat when one of the attackers pretends Elizabeth's webcam is broken. Brianne then views a recording of Elizabeth being hanged almost to death and then shot in the head by the killers. It is then revealed that the video of Elizabeth's death is also being viewed by a man surfing a website. The website features snuff film \"narratives\" of victims lured by killers exploiting The Den. The man is preparing to pay for Brianne's \"narrative\", before being interrupted by his young son."

Metacritic gives the film a weighted average of 48/100 based on 6 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" Fearnet gave The Den a positive review, commenting that it \"starts out a little rocky but if you're not completely fed up with 'found footage' filmmaking by now and you're willing to give a non-traditional visual presentation a fair shot, The Den has some pretty compelling things to say about the alleged safety of the internet.\" We Got This Covered also praised the movie, stating that it \"[executed] on a strong gimmick at a speedy, flowing pace.\" In contrast, Shock Till You Drop panned the movie as it felt that it \"lacks true scares, awesome kills or even the routine flash of nudity to warrant any sort of viewing. It panders a silly and over exaggerated message of the dangers of the anonymity of the internet and the \u201cnature\u201d of people. It uses a silly plot to carry a ridiculous camera technique and delivers nothing but angst and irritation.\" Fangoria criticized the film for many of the same reasons, as it felt that the movie began on a strong note but became \"inauthentic and irritating\" after the film depicted \"Almost everyone, online or not, responds to [the main character's troubles] with immediate hostility or disbelief.\""

        "content": "Joe, Emma, and Mandy pull up to a closed gate. Joe explains that Roderick, Joe's former right-hand, once referred him to this group. As trucks pull up, a crew of men with guns surround the trio and two seemingly authority-like figures step out. The woman, Julia, tells them to drop to their knees and put their hands behind their back. Emma and Mandy seem nervous but Joe encourages them to follow along. They get handcuffed and blindfolded as Julia and the man, Robert, lead them into one of the trucks. Ryan meets with Agent Mendez who asks if Ryan has any ideas who in the FBI may be leaking information to Joe, suggesting she's finding it hard to trust anybody anymore. Ryan uses that idea against her, and walks out claiming he doesn't know if he can trust her. On his way out, he runs into Weston who says he is leaving to go home. Despite Ryan trying to make him stay, Weston has his mind made up, as he feels too mentally unstable to continue working on the case after lashing out on Luke. He tells Ryan that his dad won't talk to him because he doesn't understand Weston's instability. Max tells Ryan that she was suspended from her job for six months. She attempts to convince Ryan to leave the hunt for Joe behind in favor of picking his life back up, returning to teaching, and living a normal life with his new family (Max). Ryan admits his obsession with Joe is what led him to teach, because he knew it would aggravate Joe, and that the only way he'll be happy is if he kills Joe himself. Max pulls into a parking garage and witnesses a father and son getting into a physical disagreement. She walks over to them, insisting the father back off. The father knocks her out as the son records the scene. The father brings Max to a room where he ties her up by her hands, leaving her dangling from the ceiling. After Ryan gets a copy of the little boy's video on his phone, he brings it to the FBI. Weston returns to assist in finding Max. Julia informs Joe that someone wants to meet with him. Joe meets Micah, the cult's leader. Joe offers his help with the cult in exchange for a place to stay. Later, Julia gives Joe a lie detector test to ensure his reasoning for being there is genuine. Afterwards, Julia informs Micah that Joe's intents are in-fact genuine. Mendez allows Ryan entry to speak to Luke, who is in custody and recovering from Weston's assault, to try to gain information on the man who kidnapped Max. Luke identifies the man as Kurt, aka \"the Huntsman,\" a serial killer known for killing women, usually prostitutes. Luke notes that Kurt had once hoped to romance Lily and will do anything for her, with the implication that he has abducted Max at Lily's request. The FBI enters Kurt's home and recognize his son from the video. After handcuffing him to get information, they find the address of where Kurt is. Max attacks Kurt and is able to run away into the woods, though Kurt chases after her. The FBI shows up and their police dogs lead them to Max and Kurt. Max sees Weston and calls him over as Kurt prepares to shoot them both from a distance. Before he is able to, he is shot dead. Joe, Emma, and Mandy are taken to a ceremony. Micah explains that offering the blood of one of their cult members will wash away the group's sins and bring them a step closer to \"going home.\" He also says that the selection will be \"through God's will\" as Julia runs through the seating area shaking a stick as though God is leading her to the selected individual, eventually stopping with her stick pointed at Emma. Emma is strapped to a post as she begs Joe for help, though Joe remains in his seat as Micah enforces that they all must trust each other. Micah slits Emma's wrists as her blood drips into a funnel, ending in a cup. Micah drinks the blood as Emma passes out. Julia informs Joe that Emma lived through the ceremony; Joe tells Julia he knows they targeted him by hurting Emma. Ryan receives a video from Lily; Mendez instructs they put it on a big screen in the FBI's office. Lily begins addressing Ryan and Weston soon recognizes the inside of his house in the background. He quickly demands a crew heads to his home to ensure his fathers safety. However, the video turns to Mark, then down to Weston's father strapped in a chair as Mark slits his throat and kills him. Weston's face fills with hysterical tears as he runs out of the room. Ryan catches up to him and holds him as he weeps outside of the FBI's building."

That evening, Tony and Oliver visit a crowded outdoor bar, where a quarter-finals football match is being watched. Tony loses sight of his son, who goes missing. Businessman Ian Garrett offers a reward for information leading to Oliver's capture, but it later emerges that, on discovering that Garrett is a paedophile, Tony beat Garrett to death and concealed the evidence. Eight years later, Oliver has not been found; the police have closed their investigation. Now divorced, Tony has continued to search for his son after seeing a recent photograph in which a little boy is wearing a scarf identical to the one Oliver was wearing on the day he disappeared and made for him with a unique insignia. Tony contacts Julien Baptiste, the retired detective who led the original investigation, and they discover where Oliver was kept prisoner after his initial disappearance. The police are persuaded by Baptiste to reopen the case, but the investigation is hampered by the disappearance of a piece of evidence, given by a corrupt police officer to a journalist.

Eventually the pair discover that Oliver was killed shortly after his disappearance, but no one survives who can tell them what happened to his body.

The idea to make a film about her story first occurred to Wheeler when she cast Chula, already diagnosed with cancer in real life, as a cancer patient who dispenses philosophical advice in her 2008 TV movie, Living Out Loud. When Wheeler and Chula worked together again the following year on Carl Bessai's film Fathers & Sons, Chula shared the story of a patient she'd met at a chemotherapy who credited her recovery to treatment in India. Wheeler, who had spent considerable time in India, decided to accompany Chula on her search for a cure. The film had its world premiere in April 2013 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. On March 9, 2014, Chi was named best short documentary film at the Canadian Screen Awards."

Jay (Ed O'Neill) sold the owner of Mandalay Bay, Burt (Ray Laska), some closet space and Burt gave him free access to the three main adult contingents at the hotel's platinum level rooms in return. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) runs into an ex-boyfriend of his, Langham (Fred Armisen), who is there with his partner Tim (Jeffrey Nicholas Brown) for their bachelor party. The two of them invite Mitchell and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) to their party but Mitchell declines the offer since he just wants to spend some time at the spa relaxing. Cam goes to the spa with Mitchell but when Mitchell has his massage, he leaves to go to Langham and Tim\u2019s pool party and gets back in time so Mitchell won't notice his absence. Gloria (Sof\u00eda Vergara) and Jay take a walk at the hotel\u2019s mall when Gloria sees Rebarka, the female version of Barkley, the butler dog that Jay bought from Las Vegas on a previous trip of his and she hates. She knows that when Jay sees it, he will want to buy it so she does everything she can to obscure Jay\u2019s view it. She manages to send Jay to their room to bring her a sweater while she pops into the store to buy Rebarka so they will take it out of the store window. On his way to the room, Jay discovers that their rooms are not on the top floor as they initially told him and he becomes intent on moving all of them to the \"Excelsior Plus\" floor. Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) wanted to go to Las Vegas for their own reasons. Phil wants to attend an underground magic society meeting that is headed by Ducky (Patton Oswalt) so he can perform his magic trick of \"metamorphosis\", while Claire wants to gamble so she can recoup the money she had lost on a previous trip to Las Vegas a few years back. Phil's appointment does not go as expected and he returns disappointed to the hotel while Claire manages to win the money she wanted, leaving her satisfied. Gloria and Jay return to their room as Jay tells Gloria that they have to convince Burt to give them rooms at the \"Excelsior Plus\" floor. Gloria opens the door and finds Rebarka there (the store delivered it instead of holding it for her as she asked them). She immediately convinced Jay to order some fine cigars for Burt and sends him away again so she can get rid of the dog. She takes it to Phil and Claire's room that is right next to theirs. In the meantime, Claire takes Mitchell to play blackjack. At the beginning he is doubtful of the idea, but he eventually likes it and wins some money. Langham sees him, and while they are talking, Mitchell accidentally leaves his room key at the table before he leaves. Langham thinks that he did it on purpose and takes it so he can join Mitchell in his room later. Mitchell gets to the room and orders the butler, Higgins (Stephen Merchant), to prepare a special bath for him and Cam while he goes to get some ice. Langham comes into the room while Mitchell is not there and Higgins, who thinks that he is Mitchell's partner, sends him to the bathroom while telling him that Mitchell is waiting for him. All the family members are back on the floor and a sequence of events takes place leading to hilarious misunderstandings. Higgins believes that when Phil talks about his wife, he means Rebarka the dog; Mitchell tells Cam that he prepared something special for the two of them but when Cam finds Langham in the tub he misunderstands Mitchell's intentions; Langham shares Cam\u2019s sentiments but still asks them to join him in the tub while also revealing that Cam was at their bachelor party; Claire comes into the room while Mitchell and Cam fight and tells them she has a surprise for them; Langham steps out of the bathroom in a robe, making Claire think she interrupted something, and Mitchell sends Langham to Jay's room because Langham's fianc\u00e9 is knocking on the door; Jay sees Langham and believes he is Burt, but Gloria tells him that he is not Burt; Langham leaves and goes to Phil's room, where Higgins sees him and believes that he is the \"Claire\" that Phil is waiting for; Phil escorts Langham out of the room while Gloria enters from the mid-room door to borrow Claire\u2019s hair products, but the towel she is wearing gets snagged in the door; Phil runs into Ducky, who came to tell him that he would like to give him a second chance for his magic trick, but before they get into the room, Gloria runs to the bathroom naked to hide; Phil takes Rebarka in the bathroom before he performs his trick while Jay meets with Burt next door; Ducky is not impressed with Phil's trick but when Gloria gets out of the bathroom dressed as a maid (she took and wore Rebarka's clothes), he believes that the transformation of the fake dog to a hot maid was part of the trick and he gets excited; Gloria returns to her room dressed as a maid at the exact moment when Jay tells Burt that he ordered him a Cuban (meaning a cigar, not a woman); Claire reveals her surprise to Mitchell and Cam, the \"Kilty Pleasures\" (an all-male revue of half-naked men dressed in kilts reminiscent of the Chippendales dancers), but instead of going to Cam and Mitchell's room, the dancers went into Jay's as he is in mid-conversation with Burt. Amused at Jay\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d, Burt gives him what he wanted: rooms at the \"Excelsior Plus\" food, only for Jay to discover a little while later that there is one more floor above the \"Excelsior Plus\u201d, which is the \"Excelsior Ultra\u201d."

Later that night, Teddy and Fred cut down a tree\u2014the one April carved a heart in\u2014with a chainsaw. The next day, Fred goes over to Emily's house.

She tells Mr. B that she does not want to come over to his house anymore. At a party, April goes outside to sit with Teddy. He says he cares about and loves her, which confuses her as they do not talk often. Later on, Teddy and Fred go to obtain weed from Skull. Among other things, Fred tells Skull that Teddy talked about wanting to cut Skull's heart out, although Fred was the one who had suggested it after he brought along a knife. Fred then asks Skull if he had a choice, would he rather be gay or a girl, to which Skull and Teddy make fun of Fred and call him a \"faggot\". Fred questions why they think it is wrong to be with a man and then explains that being inside a girl means that she is the one in control of the man and not the other way around.

Vasudeva Shenoy, Laksmi's colleague expresses his desire to marry her, despite his mother's objections. Kunjunni poses as a police constable and manages to marry Lakshmi before Shenoy can convince his mother. Shenoy then gets married and both the couples are blessed with baby boys on the same day. In the present, Shenoy's son Vikram has become an SI and proposes to his childhood friend Deepika a week before joining. Lakshmi's son Adithyan, who has been missing for a few years, returns to town at the same time. The story then proceeds into a series of flashbacks. Lakshmi finds out that Kunjunni had cheated on her but they pretend to have an amicable marriage. A young Adithyan however, still believes his father to be a policeman. He and Vikram become rivals in school and start competing with each other, wagering that the loser should salute the winner, a habit they then carry into adulthood. Adithyan always ends up losing. One day Kunjunni is caught red-handed by Shenoy and his team while attempting a theft and is paraded half-naked through the street. A distraught Adithyan and friends watch the scene. Unable to face his son and berated by Lakshmi, Kunjunni reaches a bridge. Kunjunni was found dead beneath the bridge the next day.

Though the two share a healthy rivalry, Shenoy is spiteful towards Adithyan. Adithyan outranks Vikram in the preliminary round which irritates Shenoy. Vikram however, acknowledges Adithyan's superior intellect displaying his deep respect for his rival. Shenoy is able to trap Adithyan in a narcotics case and desperate to put him behind bars, he guards the evidence personally. But Adithyan is saved when Vikram secretly swaps the evidence with Lactose powder and Adithyan expresses his gratitude, revealing that the respect they hold is mutual. In a final attempt, Shenoy convinces Lakshmi that he was the one who swapped in evidence and asks her for a favor in return. Lakshmi hides the interview memo Adithyan was to receive and only Vikram's name appears on the list for the final exam. A heartbroken Adithyan blames Lakshmi for Kunjunni's death and claims that she could have changed him had she tried. Adithyan disappears that night. In the present, the police station is holding a small function to commemorate Shenoy's retirement and Vikram taking charge on the same day.

One evening, as the family is playing on the beach, they are told to be quieter and discover that a TV show is being filmed nearby.  They watch and, as they are about to leave, the star, Milly, calls them over and gives Gelsomina a hair clip. Watching the program on TV, Gelsomina learns that it is launching a competition called Countryside Wonders, in which seven farmers will compete to have their products featured. While her father is strongly against participating, her mother warms to the idea, even though the quality of their honey is not great. Meanwhile, Wolfgang hires a juvenile delinquent named Martin to help with honey production. Martin never talks. Though Wolfgang tries to help Martin, he discovers that he is ineffectual. Unbeknownst to her father, Gelsomina applies on behalf of her family. She forgets about it after her father's old friend comes to stay. Later, left alone by their parents, while switching out the honeycombs to put in the processor, she accidentally injures one of her sisters, Marinella. At the hospital, while Marinella is being stitched up, Gelsomina realizes that Martin forgot to change the bucket which collects the processed honey and, on returning home, they find honey spilled over the floor. At the same time, they are visited by a man from the competition to inspect their production room. The children clean the work area and they are accepted. However, Wolfgang is infuriated by the news. Nevertheless, the family competes on the show, where they are dressed in ridiculous garb and must plead their case to the judges. On TV, Wolfgang freezes and cannot explain what makes his honey so special. However, Gelsomina steps up and, with Martin, performs a trick in which he whistles and bees crawl out of her mouth onto her face. The family loses the competition, however. Martin runs away and Gelsomina follows him but cannot find him. On the last boat ride back from the island, she finds herself alone with Milly, who takes off her wig and gives Gelsomina a hairpin.

They wake up at a table where Mark and Luke interrogate Ryan and Joe, threatening to kill Claire if they don't cooperate. Mike and Max show up and Mike shoots at Luke through a window while Joe cuts himself free. After everyone splits, Mike finds Mark and tells him that he killed Lily, not Ryan. Luke knocks Mike down but Max shoots Luke dead. Mark picks up Luke's body and runs off while a confrontation between Joe and Claire leads to Ryan putting Joe at gunpoint as Joe begs Ryan to kill him. Ryan, however, chooses not to shoot Joe and has Mike call Agent Clarke to have Joe arrested. Ryan suggests to Claire that he pack a bag and move to Claire's home with her and Joey but Claire tells him that they need to move on separately so she can give her son a normal life. Mike admits to Max that he would have killed Joe before the two share a kiss. That night, Ryan has a nightmare where he finds Luke's dead body lying in bed next to him, and Mark standing over him telling him he's a dead man. The episode and season ends with Mark, carrying Luke's body, being picked up by a truck with an unknown driver."

        "content": "The finale was watched by 4.81 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.5/4, up slightly from the previous episode, but down significantly from the first season finale. The show placed second in its timeslot and ninth for the night. Also, including DVR viewership, the episode was watched by a total of 7.28 million viewers and attained an 18-49 rating of 2.5. The finale received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 7.4 out of 10, signaling positive reviews, saying it \"was a fairly focused episode. Escape the church and rescue Claire. Not much else going on. It attempted to get deep during the dinner scene, where Ryan had to admit (again) that he was a bad person, but that stuff always winds up sliding off the back of this series like a rainwater. Still, I liked the dinner showdown and appreciated that the episode was mostly a straightforward affair.\" He then commented on James Purefoy's role in the finale and season, saying \"After last week's church massacre, Joe has seemed to have purged his system of all future cult activity, satisfied that his name will probably now live forever. Which made him a more docile, agreeable Joe when it came time to pair up with Ryan. It's all utterly silly, but at least it looks like next year Ryan and Joe might have a different dynamic.\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode \u2014 and the season \u2014 a mixed review, rating the finale 3 out of 5, saying \" There\u2019s no doubt that The Following Season 2 featired [sic] a promising and entertaining first half that reinvigorated the series. And yet, as if it couldn\u2019t help but follow the path of The Following Season 1, the second half seemed to fall apart on its inevitable journey to a Ryan and Joe final face off with stuff that really ended up not mattering thrown in along the way.\" He then commented positively on Ryan's decision to spare Joe, saying \"I appreciate Ryan\u2019s closure and seeing him attain the victory without killing Joe, but it doesn\u2019t excuse the mess that led up to the final hour of The Following Season 2. Too many shock value killings, pointless mini-quests and plenty of characters making really bad decisions plagued those latter episodes.\" Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club gave a much more negative response to the episode, giving it a D grade, saying \"The problem is that this show never really committed to what Joe Carroll was supposed to be. In the first season, he was megalomaniacal; in this season, he\u2019s oddly measured and wry. This finale plays more like a bizarre buddy-cop comedy\u2014in which Ryan and Joe play bad-cop/worse-cop against a pair of crazy serial killers who believe in death; never mind that Joe is also a crazy serial killer who believes in death.\" Dan Hajducky of Den of Geek also gave a negative review, rating it 1 out of 5, saying \"There it is, folks. Season 2, in the books. For me, The Following is a show that has undone all of its original promise. It\u2019s unfortunate to see the talents of Bacon, Ashmore, Purefoy, Underwood, and Stroup squandered on this semi-soap opera.\""

A nearly naked man jumps from the popped trunk and bolts through the snow into the woods.  Malvo calmly watches as the man runs away and makes no attempt at pursuit, instead choosing to gaze upon the dying deer. In town, the next day, a put-upon insurance salesman named Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) runs into Sam Hess (Kevin O'Grady), a former high school bully along with his sons Mickey and Moe. After reminiscing about the bullying he gave Lester, Sam intimidates Lester into accidentally running into a window and breaking his nose. At the hospital, Lester meets Malvo and tells him about Sam, and Malvo offers to murder him.  Lester fails to respond, but Malvo goes to Sam's workplace, to get a glimpse of him, and later that night murders him at a strip club by throwing a knife into his head. The next day, Lester meets Malvo in a motel restaurant and confronts him about the murder.  Malvo tells Lester that if Lester does not stand up to \"the boss, [Lester] will get washed away\". Meanwhile, Chief Vern Thurman (Shawn Doyle) and Deputy Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) investigate the car wreck and find the nearly naked man's frozen body in the nearby woods. They also look into Sam's death. While they are questioning Sam's wife Gina (Kate Walsh), Malvo calls Mickey pretending to be an attorney, and claims Moe inherited everything, leading the Mickey to beat Moe with a hockey stick before Molly tackles him. The police learn that Lester was overheard discussing Sam with another man (Malvo), at the hospital.  Lester tries to impress his wife, Pearl (Kelly Holden Bashar), by repairing the couple's washing machine, but he fails at it, and Pearl mocks him.  Lester, reaching his breaking point after years of her psychological abuse, hits her with a hammer and kills her. A panicked Lester summons Malvo to help with the aftermath.  Vern arrives at Lester's house to question him about Sam, but discovers Pearl\u2019s body in the basement. Vern radios for backup, but Malvo arrives soon afterward and fatally shoots him. Malvo disappears before Molly shows up, and Lester intentionally knocks himself out to make the killings look like a home invasion.  He eventually wakes up in the hospital and notices a piece of gun shot lodged in his hand. Later, in Duluth, police officer Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks) converses over radio with his daughter Greta (Joey King), until he pulls Malvo over for running a stop sign. Malvo overhears the radio and threatens Gus to either press the issue and face death, or allow Malvo to leave and live. Malvo drives away as a shaken Gus returns to his patrol car."

Sports chairman Peter Braganza (Kiran Kumar) expresses his desire of making street fighting a legal sport and decides to open a league called Right 2 Fight (R2F). Meanwhile, imprisoned Garson \"Gary\" Fernandes (Jackie Shroff), a recovering alcoholic and former MMA expert under rehabilitation, is released from his jail term, and his younger son Monty (Sidharth Malhotra) comes to pick him up. Monty gets tensed when his father asks about his elder son David and takes him away to their home. At home, Gary acts protective of all the belongings of his wife, Maria, who died many years ago. David (Akshay Kumar), now a physics teacher, has a daughter with a kidney ailment. Unable to arrange money from the bank and other sources, he starts to earn money through street fights, as he was once a promising MMA fighter when he was younger. This stresses out his wife, Jenny (Jacqueline Fernandez), as she is worried about David. Meanwhile, Gary, who misses his wife Maria (Shefali Shah), starts hallucinating about her and violently attacks a mirror from self-hating about how he destroyed his family. Monty rushes to stop and comfort his father, realizing how much regret he has. Gary then tries to meet David, but the latter ends up throwing Monty and Gary out of his house in a rage after Gary sees his granddaughter and learns David named her after his mother, Maria. Over a flashback, Monty is revealed to be Gary's illegitimate child. Maria nevertheless loved Monty, as she did David. The two brothers had a close, loving relationship until David was 18 and Monty was 15. On the night of Monty's 15th birthday, Gary came home drunk and apologized to Maria for destroying the family, but mentioned his lover Sarah's name, instead of Maria's. An enraged Maria confronted Gary about this, and in a drunken state, Gary hit Maria, who was injured from hitting her head on the furniture and died. A furious David pushed Gary aside; when Monty came close to Maria, who reached out to him before passing, David angrily pushed him away, holding his father and half-brother equally responsible for his mother's death. This is what created the rift between Gary, Monty, and David. David later loses his job in school when principal Shobhit Desai (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) learns about David's involvement in street fights. Monty, who wants to be a fighter, is then introduced to Suleiman Pasha (Ashutosh Rana), a fighting agent who is old friends with Gary, as they trained together. Suleiman fixes a match with Mustafa in which Monty is defeated. This enrages Gary, but Monty asks for a rematch with Mustafa, where Monty brutally defeats Mustafa after listening to his father\u2019s advice and is declared a selected fighter for R2F by Peter. The fight is recorded and uploaded to YouTube, and soon Monty becomes an internet sensation. Monty undergoes training to become the R2F champion. Meanwhile, David, too, decides to be a full-time fighter, and Jenny encourages him to do so. Suleiman is initially unconvinced by David but arranges a match while Monty celebrates his victory at a bar. David is soon victorious in the fight and is accepted for R2F after convincing Suleiman of his true potential. R2F begins its grand debut and soon becomes a sensation as fighters from all over the world show their interest in the league. Monty has a solid time winning till he goes up against Luca, a fighter who is notorious for knocking out his opponents but ends up defeating him in a total knockout, shocking the audience as he becomes the first finalist. Meanwhile David the underdog comes up with a good game plan to outlast his opponents to reach the semis. There, he fights Hammer; an aggressive fighter who kicks the cage, injuring Gary. This causes David to violently assault Hammer in retaliation, and he too advances to the finale. After beating their last opponents the brothers are now the finalists and their identities as siblings are revealed to the public causing massive media coverage for the R2F. Gary, feeling guilty about his sons fighting each other instead of loving one another because of his mistake, leaves the arena. Jenny, David\u2019s students, and everyone back at Suleiman\u2019s fight club watch the match, which becomes brutal from the heated rivalry between the brothers. Monty proves dominant in striking and throws in cheap shots to taunt David, Gary heads back to the arena when he sees the fight. During the fight, David breaks Monty's shoulder, which causes David concern as Monty refuses to give up. Gary rushes towards the cage and apologizes for his mistakes, and tells David not to direct his anger towards his brother. Monty continues to fight despite David\u2019s plea to stop. David gets Monty in a rear-naked chokehold and tells Monty not to fight anymore. Monty, in turn, tells David to continue to choke him because David is selfish and never considered how Monty felt that night, telling him Maria was also his mother and how lonely he was without her and David in his life. David moved to tears, now realizing how much pain he caused to his brother finally apologizes, and Monty allows David to win the championship. David takes Monty in his arms, and both brothers walk backstage, now having finally reconciled."

On 20 July 2013, a teaser trailer for the film was released, in response to the Child marriage controversy ongoing in Nigeria at the time. The film's theme focuses on Vesicovaginal fistula condition and underaged marriage among young women, narrating the story of a thirteen-year-old girl, Halima (Zubaida Ibrahim Fagge), whose poor uneducated parents marry her off to Sani (Tijjani Faraga), a 60-year-old man, who constantly rapes her. Halima gets pregnant and suffers Vesicovaginal Fistula (VVF) after child delivery; she's consequently abandoned by her husband and discriminated against in the society. Zara (Stephanie Okereke), a medical doctor who also suffered a horrific childhood meets Halima; she tries to help her get through her situation and also save other young women under such circumstance."

        "content": "Okereke had been disturbed with child marriage issue since she was in College and had been thinking on how to tackle the topic. The making of Dry was inspired by a true life story of a lady Okereke met in Northern Nigeria. She stated: \"I have been to the North and to other parts of the country, and I have seen first-hand how this health issue defies normal living for girls and women of different ages. I have decided to share their stories through DRY\" \"The issue might seem controversial, but if it will set one girl free and open the minds of the people, and also instruct different bodies and individuals to take action, then the movie would have served its purpose\". According to Linus, the film was in production for three years; it was reported in September 2012 that Stephanie Okereke just hit location for the film. The film marked the return of Liz Benzon to the big screen after a long time of absence from films. The opening scenes which were initially meant to be shot in Los Angeles were later moved to Aberystwyth, Wales by the line producers, Akanimo Odon and Murtza Ali Ghaznavi. The film was also shot in Aberystwyth University campus, in which the university acted as a production partner. Students from the University's Department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies were present on set to gain practical experience and to also help with the film shoot, and several University staff had minor acting roles, in addition to the professional cast."

This was around the time of \"Child marriage controversy in Nigeria\", when the senate was unable to remove a clause of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which states that \"any woman that is married in Nigeria is of full age\" due to shortage of votes from members of senate. This however was misconstrued by the general public as a bill for underaged marriage, which drew a lot of media attention at the time. Stephanie Okereke coincidentally just concluded the principal photography of the film at the time, so she released a RAW footage teaser trailer to lend her voice against the \"alleged bill\". The official trailer was released on 3 September 2014. Dry premiered on 29 November 2014 at the Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Wales. Behind the Scenes documentary video for the film was uploaded on \"NextPage\" YouTube channel on 30 July 2015, and the film premiered at the Silverbird Galleria in Lagos on 3 August 2015. The film also premiered in Abuja on 13 August 2015, before going on a general release the next day, on 14 August."

The psychiatrist Alberto Spinelli, who should have taken care of Paolo, easily realizes that the problem belongs to Luisa and tries to subject her to therapy; the problem worsens as soon Luisa is convinced that Alberto is her husband. From that moment, the life of the spouses is upset: Alberto, convinced that Luisa has suffered a trauma, supports her to try to heal her; while Paolo, jealous, wants to resume his post as consort and fears that the psychiatrist will take advantage of the situation. After various misadventures (which also involve Luisa's eccentric aunt, who got mad at Paolo), Alberto realizes that the cause of Luisa's problem is Allegra, Paolo's young and busty typist. Luisa offers of her own free will to reconstruct a precise event and lets it be understood that she has glimpsed him and Allegra in an unequivocal attitude through a half-open door. After finishing telling the fact, Luisa appears able to remember everything, recognizing Paolo as her husband: later she confesses that she has never lost her memory, and that she has devised a stratagem to punish her husband for his betrayal. The two reconcile, while Alberto, who after his long association had begun to fall in love with the woman, remains alone and disconsolate."

        "content": "Suresh 'Suru' Mukund wants to be a big dancer to fulfill his mother's wish. Vinita \"Vinnie\" Sharma wants to be the best hip-hop dancer. Childhood friends from suburban Nalasopara, Mumbai, they form a team and participate in a national-level competition Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin where they are disqualified from the grand finale as their moves are revealed to be copied from the performance act of the Philippine All Stars and the judges term them \"cheaters\". Everyone departs to search for jobs. Suru returns to work in a bar as a waiter, Vinnie rejoins a beauty parlor and Vernon gets back as a delivery boy where, on and off, they are insulted as cheaters. The departure of angry teammates adds injury to insult, and nothing is set to be corrected. Suru hopes to remove the negative tag by planning to win a grander hip-hop competition in Las Vegas. One day he watches Vishnu, a rogue visitor, prove his dance mettle to a betting visitor in the bar and convinces him repeatedly to be their choreographer. They audition for people and formulate the team. During the practices for qualifiers, Vinod, a deaf-mute dancer, discovers Vinnie and Suru's hidden love for each other. They visit the qualifiers in Bangalore, where they are pre-insulted as cheaters, but manage to win it after Vishnu begs the audience for one last chance for the team. Although things are fine, Suru is broken when Shetty Anna, the owner of the bar where he is employed, refuses to provide him financial support extending to Rs. 25 lakhs, something he had earlier publicly promised to Suru at the time of the Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin finale, and Suru leaves the place, angry at Anna's insulting language for Vinnie. However, Vishnu manages to get the money from Crocxz's uncle who he convinces after Suru loses hope when Vishnu gets angry at his inability to arrange team funds. Later they prepare to go to Las Vegas, but Vinod learns from Vishnu himself that the latter has ulterior motives to go to Vegas, and, as a matter of fact, he had deliberately impressed Suru and friends to procure a way out for his plan. After reaching Las Vegas, they win the qualifiers. Later, Vishnu leaves the hotel with team money to meet his son Manu, whose mother Swati, Vishnu's ex-wife, is married to another man and has moved on in life. His son Manu recognizes him, his art, and his achievements, and Vishnu leaves with a contented heart. Meanwhile, Vinnie is injured due to excessive rehearsal and is replaced by Olive, an American girl of partial Indian origin, and Vishnu discovers this while thanking friend Gopi, who works in a bar-cum-hotel. At the same time, Suru is enraged when he finds Vishnu missing and tries to proceed with jam sessions all on his own, but in vain. Vishnu returns while trying to save the day for Suru from the German team as they get into a fight, later admitting he had made a 'mistake' leaving without permission although he didn't want to lose a family he had yearned to create in years; he apologizes, is forgiven by Suru, and the team enters the finals. Across rehearsals, Olive gets close to Suru, and a jealous Vinnie finally confronts Suru, who initially finds it difficult to confess his love for her as they had been best friends from childhood, but eventually gets together with her. Although Olive has feelings for Suru, an in-person conversation with Vinnie assures Olive that Suru had that inherent charm with nothing to do about his sweetness, and Olive agrees to continue with the Indian Stunners after Vinnie recovers. The team enters the final, where Vinod's health worsens during an \"assemblage\" by the team, and the formation suddenly breaks down even as his friend D, who knew about his tuberculosis problem, tries to support him. Everyone has almost given up after the accident when Vinod tries to encourage Suru, who forgoes the accident and the others return to make the formation with success with Vinod at the bottom. Although unable to win the competition, they win the hearts of millions, with Suru lending a voiceover narrative about his mother's motivational lessons on dance."

Agent Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, having recently assisted with the cleanup of London following the Convergence, investigate the tree and deduce that it contained an Asgardian staff. Consulting with Elliot Randolph, a professor of Norse mythology, they learn of the Berserker, an Asgardian warrior who remained on Earth after a long ago war, and broke his war staff into three pieces. The professor reveals three poems, each pointing to the location of a piece; one matched the tree in Norway. Randolph sends the team to Baffin Island, but they soon realize that this was misdirection. They follow one of the poems to underground catacombs in Spain, where Randolph forces agent Grant Ward to touch a second piece of the staff, unlocking painful memories of a young boy in a well. The pagans attack Randolph with their own piece of the staff, taking his. Coulson arrests Randolph, and they discover that he is the Asgardian Berserker. He directs them to Ireland, to a church where he hid the third piece of the staff, but the pagans also find the church. The staff causes great surges of adrenalin within its users, and for Ward this comes from his memories\u2014he had been forced by his older brother to trap their younger brother in a well. Ward manages to defeat the pagans, with the help of agent Melinda May, who can control the staff after learning to live with her own bad memories. Coulson, Jemma Simmons, and Leo Fitz manage to keep Randolph alive long enough for his Asgardian heart to heal itself, and though Coulson wishes to touch the staff himself to try and unlock memories from his death and resurrection, Randolph convinces him not to. That night, Ward turns down agent Skye's offer to talk about his past, instead going to May's hotel room."

        "content": "European mercenaries, including Irishman William Garin and Spaniard Pero Tovar, travel to China during the reign of the Song dynasty's Renzong Emperor, searching for the secret to gunpowder. A few miles north of the Great Wall, they are attacked by a monster. Only Garin and Tovar survive; they sever the monster's arm and bring it with them. Upon reaching the Wall, they are taken prisoner by soldiers of the Nameless Order, led by General Shao and Strategist Wang. The Nameless Order exists to combat alien monsters called Tao Tie, which arrived from a meteorite and attack once every sixty years. While examining the severed monster arm, the Order's commanders are surprised by the monsters' first assault, which has come one week early. Shortly after, a horde of Tao Tie assails the Wall. Both sides sustain heavy losses before the monsters' queen aborts the attack. During the battle, Garin and Tovar are freed by Ballard, another European who came east twenty-five years earlier in search of gunpowder; detained, he now serves as an English and Latin teacher. Garin and Tovar display amazing battle skills, saving the life of young warrior Peng Yong, then slaying two monsters, earning them the Order's respect. The three Europeans secretly plan to steal gunpowder and flee during the next monster attack. That night, two Tao Tie reach the top of the Wall. General Shao is killed, placing Commander Lin in charge of the Nameless Order. Around this time, an envoy from the capital arrives with an ancient scroll which suggests that the monsters are pacified by magnets. Wang believes the stone Garin carries enabled him to slay the Tao Tie he fought at the cave. To test the hypothesis, Garin suggests they capture a Tao Tie alive and agrees to help. This delays his escape plans, angering Tovar, who nevertheless assists Garin despite Ballard's protests. During the next attack, the Tao Tie are numerous enough to cause Lin to resort to using arrows equipped with black powder, whose capabilities had been kept secret from the Westerners until now. They capture a living Tao Tie and prove the theory. However, the Imperial envoy claims the monster and takes it to the capital to present to the Emperor. A tunnel is discovered at the base of the Wall; the previous attacks had been a distraction so that the Tao Tie could dig the tunnel. While Lin investigates, Tovar and Ballard steal a supply of black powder and escape, knocking Garin unconscious for trying to stop them. Garin is arrested by the Nameless Order, and is locked up in the Wall. Some distance away, Ballard betrays and abandons Tovar, but is captured by bandits, who accidentally  kill Ballard and themselves after igniting the powder. At the capital, the envoy presents the captive Tao Tie to the Emperor and his entourage, but it awakens and reveals its position to its queen, who signals the Tao Tie to attack. The Order rushes to the capital. Lin orders the use of hot-air balloons, and sets Garin free before leaving. Wang tells him to warn the outside world, but Garin boards the last balloon with Peng and Wang. They arrive just in time to save Lin from being devoured. They land in the Emperor's palace, where Wang proposes killing the queen by tying explosives to the captured Tao Tie and giving it meat to be delivered to the queen. While approaching the site, a horde of Tao Tie attack the band, and Peng sacrifices himself to save the others. After releasing the Tao Tie, Lin and Garin climb a tower so that Garin can detonate the explosives with an arrow. Wang sacrifices himself to buy time for Lin and Garin to reach the upper floors. Two of Garin's arrows are deflected by the Tao Tie queen's bodyguards, but Garin throws the magnet into the horde, creating a gap in the shields, allowing Lin's spear to get through. The queen is killed, and the rest of the horde is paralyzed. With the threat eliminated, Garin is allowed to return home and elects to take Tovar (whom the Nameless Order recaptured) with him instead of a reward of black powder, much to Tovar's annoyance."

        "content": "Tess Thorne, a successful crime-mystery writer, is invited to a library in upstate Massachusetts for a meet-and-greet with fans, but is scared of flying so drives to engagements even long distances away. After the event, Ramona, the organizer, suggests a quicker route home for Tess. However, it takes her via a remote rural location where her car runs over nail-studded planks lying across the road, puncturing her tire. It happens by an abandoned gas station and, having no signal for her cell phone, Tess hopes that someone will stop to help. A man in a pickup stops and offers to assist. At first he seems eager to help, but soon turns nasty. He hits her, then brutally rapes and beats her, before choking her into unconsciousness. He drags her into a culvert and leaves her there. When she recovers the man is gone, and she finds three female bodies in the culvert, all victims (she assumes) of the same man. Tess leaves to find help, but as she walks she worries that the attack will create a scandal \u2013 she will be attacked in the media for \"asking for it\" and blamed. She will be re-traumatized and her reputation will be destroyed. She comes across a convenience store and calls a limousine service for a ride home. She decides that she cannot tell anyone what happened. When Tess is safely home, she decides to avenge herself. She receives a call from Betsy, a waitress at the Stagger Inn, telling her that her car has been parked there. The pair form a bond by both being victims of violence. Tess later realizes that Ramona is her attacker's mother and accomplice, who sought her out and invited her to the library, then led her into her son's trap. That night, she goes to Ramona's house with a gun to confront her. Ramona denies all knowledge and during a struggle Ramona wrestles the gun from Tess, then reveals that she helped orchestrate the attack and pulls the trigger, firing on an empty chamber. Tess grabs a kitchen knife and stabs Ramona before shooting her. She then spots an earring that she lost during the rape attack. In the house, Tess finds clues that identify her attacker as Lester Norville, aka Big Driver. At a nearby gas station she sees his rig, and notes the address on the truck. On the way to the address she sees the rig parked, and stops. The green pickup that he drove to the attack pulls into the lot. Fired up, Tess runs to the truck and shoots the driver as he climbs out, but then realizes he is not Big Driver, but rather his brother Little Driver. She regrets the killing, but at the urging of \"Doreen\" (a character from one of her books who is part of the \"Knitting Club\" with whom Tess often communicates) she moves forward to \"finish the job.\" Tess drives on to the address which turns out to be Big Driver's home. Breaking in, she finds graphic photos of his victims and photos of the brothers together with each body. There are also photos of her being raped by Big Driver. Realizing that Little Driver is not innocent, she no longer feels guilt about shooting him. Hearing noises from an outbuilding, Tess enters to find Big Driver working at a bench; confronting him, she fires twice before the gun empties and she runs outside. He painfully follows her but she hits him on the head with a nailed plank like the one that caused the flat tire. As he is trying to escape, she calmly reloads and shoots him in the groin and watches him die. Doreen appears again and urges her to leave quickly. An anonymous tip leads police to the bodies in the culvert, and to Big Driver's house with the incriminating photos. At home shortly afterwards, Tess receives an anonymous call from a woman she realizes is Betsy, who says, \"I know what you've done. Way to go, girl!\""

When she learns that her sister, Marie Truffle, is destitute, Polly decides to take her, her husband Elmer and their three children, Vivian, Jerry and Marty, from South Bend, Indiana, into her home. Joyce, Polly's socialite daughter, objects to her mother's decision, insisting that the Truffles are too unrefined to live among the Rochays. When the Truffles finally arrive in the big city, Polly puts her sister to work at her salon while Elmer looks for work as a mail carrier. Joyce resents the intrusion of the ill-mannered Truffles, and Polly concurs with her when the meddlesome Marie damages the beauty parlor and her children scratch her car. One evening, while Joyce is out on a date with her playboy sweetheart, Johnnie Beasley, Marie and Polly compare their daughters' boyfriends. Polly boasts that Johnnie is the better because he is a sophisticated millionaire, while Marie informs Polly that Tommy Haverly, Vivian's boyfriend, is from one of the oldest families in South Bend. Polly then insults Marie when she tells her that Vivian will never meet the same caliber of men that Joyce meets. When Johnnie brings Joyce home, he meets Vivian and takes an immediate liking to her, which makes Joyce jealous. The next day, after spurning Tommy, Vivian goes on a lunch date with Johnnie. Joyce later accuses Vivian of trying to steal her boyfriend. At the salon, Marie makes a nuisance of herself when, after a series of errors, she accidentally locks Polly in the steam room. Later, Polly and Marie become embroiled in their daughters' quarrel over Johnnie, and Marie strikes Joyce when Joyce insults Vivian. Three months pass, and the Truffles, now settled into their own home, await the arrival of Johnnie, who has been dating Vivian and will be escorting her to a party. While Vivian and Johnnie are out on their date, the heartbroken Joyce visits Marie and begs her to intervene in her daughter's affair with the man she loves. Moved by her show of emotion, Marie agrees to help Joyce by going to Johnnie's and speaking to him on her behalf. At Johnnie's, Marie accuses the young playboy of unfairly turning Vivian's head with fancy cars, yachts and other luxuries and then giving her the gate. Marie then insists that Johnnie marry Joyce, which he agrees to do. Marie tells her daughter that Johnnie was not worthy of her love because he was only seeing her to make Joyce jealous. After Joyce and Johnnie's wedding, Polly, unaware that Marie was responsible for their reunion, calls to gloat about the news and remind Marie that Vivian should have \"stayed in her own class.\" However, when Joyce explains Marie's involvement, Polly thanks her sister for her help, and the two forgive each other."

His father is upset, and while his mother is ambivalent as she feels for her son, she does not stand up to her husband either. His father then refuses to sign the scholarship application for Columbia University where Danny is supposed to attend, but Danny departs for New York anyway, leaving behind his supportive younger sister Phoebe. After reaching Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, he is befriended by a multiracial group of young, gay, and genderfluid street kids and drag queens, and witnesses police violence against them. Danny goes into the Stonewall Inn accompanied by his friends and is asked for a dance by an older man, Trevor, who is a member of the Mattachine Society. Later that night, the police raid the bar and arrest some customers. Danny, who did not get arrested because he was not cross-dressing, picks up his friend Ray at the police station next day. Danny, destitute, then turns to prostitution and is seen disgraced while being fellated by a middle-aged man. Danny then goes to a meeting of the Mattachine Society, which purports to attain gay rights through conforming to society rather than radicalism. There he finds Trevor, and though their opinions differ, they end up spending the night together. Danny soon finds Trevor with another young man, and, heartbroken, he decides to leave the Village. Immediately after, he is abducted and forcibly sent out to a high-class prostitution business, at the direction of Ed Murphy, who runs the Stonewall Inn. Murphy has colluded with corrupt policemen and exploited homeless gay youth to his own advantage. Danny escapes, aided by Ray, and the two go to the bar to confront Murphy. The police then raid the bar and arrest some customers again. Danny is thrown onto the street as well as the rest of the customers, and, despite Trevor's dissuasion, hurls a brick into one of the bar's windows, screaming \"Gay power!\" This instigates the crowd to attack the police, who lock themselves up in the bar in response. One year later, after finishing his first year at the university, Danny returns home and tells his sister that he is going to attend the gay liberation march on Christopher Street. The film ends on the day of the parade where he is marching in the street after reuniting with his friends and discovers his mother and sister on the sidewalk."

        "content": "Half-brothers Yasha (Yakov) and Merab Papashvili live in Tbilisi. Yasha is a musician, and Merab works as a taxi driver. In 1987, Yasha (being half-Jewish on his mother's side) decides to repatriate to Israel with his family. Merab, being quite happy with his own lifestyle of a careless playboy and not thinking of emigration, accompanies them to Moscow and then to the Sheremetyevo airport. The brothers want to drink champagne together one last time, but the local cafe would not serve any and sends them to the duty-free shop instead. Not quite realizing the possible consequences, easy-going Merab grabs his brother's travel document and crosses the border checkpoint, pretending to be him. He buys champagne in the duty-free, but then realizes that he can't walk back quite as easily. He runs frantically around the airport, and due to a series of misunderstandings ends up being escorted to board a plane (meant for Yasha) which immediately takes off. While onboard, Merab befriends the charming adventurer Borya, who is dressed as a stereotypical Russian peasant and sports a balalaika. The plane lands in Vienna (a common practice at the time, due to the lack of direct flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv). As soon as they leave the airport, Borya breaks his balalaika apart to reveal a large stash of US dollars hidden inside (which at the time was illegal to own in the Soviet Union, let alone earn). He proceeds to buy himself a stylish outfit in the nearest supermarket and casually offers Merab a job. When the latter refuses, Borya gives him a taxi ride to the Soviet embassy and leaves, cheerfully anticipating to continue his spending spree. Merab tries unsuccessfully to get help from the embassy, but is told that the ambassador is off till Monday, and even then his case can't be resolved quickly. When Merab tries to press the issue, he is promptly apprehended by the Austrian police, taken mugshot of, and handed over to Sokhnut. There he again meets Borya, who had already managed to lose all his money in a casino. Undaunted, he contemplates the new business opportunities. Both decide to let Sokhnut fly them to Israel. Once in Israel, Merab again pretends to be Yasha to get through the immigration procedures. His new plan is to borrow some money from the local relatives, then return to USSR on a tourist visa and switch places with the real Yasha. He is received by Uncle Izya (Isaac) and his wife. After hearing his improbable story, Izya thinks he is a KGB spy and throws him out of the house at gunpoint. After spending a night in an abandoned boat on the beach, Merab visits the local market and encounters a casual acquaintance from Tbilisi, a former policeman, who brings him to a lavish party attended by another acquaintance of both, wealthy and influential Tengiz. At first Tengiz seems sympathetic, but Izya, who happened to be among the guests too, denounces Merab as a KGB agent. Merab is beaten and thrown out. After spending another night on the beach, Merab tries to contact the Soviet mission, but they wouldn't believe his story and suspect him of being an agent provocateur of some kind. Enraged, Merab follows the official to the parking and handcuffs himself to his car (he borrowed a pair of handcuffs from another protester a little earlier). However, this turns out to be a wrong car, and the official departs. Having no keys to the handcuffs, Merab unhinges the car door and carries it around for a while, before being able to break free. Merab is approached by an American journalist Jane and confides his story to her. She introduces him to old Senya (Semyon), a World War II veteran who works in a huge industrial freezing facility and seems to be involved in some shady business. He proposes a plan to sneak Merab secretly through the borders back to the USSR, and they depart on a fridge truck. On the way, both drink and sing Russian songs. Senya grows increasingly paranoid and incapacitates several innocent bystanders who seem suspicious to him. The truck is stopped by the police, while Merab is driving. Senya pretends to be asleep and not knowing Merab at all. Merab tries to run, is shot in the leg, arrested, taken mugshot of (this becomes a sort of a running gag in the movie), and thrown in prison. There he quickly changes several cells, being beaten by both Muslims and Jews after his unsuccessful attempts to blend in. Soon thereafter, Merab is bailed out of prison by Tengiz, who was alerted by Senya and after checking with mutual acquaintances in Tbilisi realized that Merab is in fact not a spy. They drive through the desert, when Senya confronts them on his fridge truck and stubbornly insists on his original plan. When Tengiz protests, Senya incapacitates him, then also Merab, and forcibly brings the latter to the border. Resigned to his fate, Merab bluntly obeys. Suddenly turned somber and mournful, Senya gives Merab his wedding ring and asks to put it on his wife's grave back in the USSR. (A flash-forward sequence during the opening credits, unexplained until now, reveals that in due time Merab made good on this promise). Senya walks Merab through the minefield, gives him directions and contacts, walks back and blows up on a landmine in what was possibly a deliberate suicide. Devastated, Merab remains on the site until captured by Jordanian border patrol. He is apprehended, taken mugshot of, and imprisoned as an Israeli spy. Three years later Merab is released from the prison. Using Senya's contacts, he crosses to Turkey and travels to the border with USSR. His original travel document is probably lost or expired, and in any case not meant for reentry, so he has no legal way of entering. Left without other options, he wades across the border river, waist-deep, with arms outstretched, begging the unseen border guards not to shoot. The film ends with yet another mugshot."

The kidnappers drive away with Olivia in an ambulance in which one of the kidnappers, Otto (Robert Baker), tells her to beg and negotiate for her release, but Olivia refuses and tells them that she will only talk with the leader of the kidnapping. She is then drugged and passes out. Olivia wakes up in a demolished cell with a cell mate, a man named Ian Woods (Jason Butler Harner), who claims to have been there a long time. He tells her that he is a journalist and was kidnapped after finishing a story in Egypt. Olivia assures Ian that she will get them out of there. As time goes by, Olivia and Ian begin to bond and share details of each other's lives. One day when she is in the bathroom, Olivia discovers a window and tries to escape through it, but is caught by the kidnappers who, knowing they can't harm her, decide to punish her instead by taking Ian and shooting him.

In her dreams, both Tom Larsen (Brian Letscher) and Abby (Darby Stanchfield) show up to tell her that she does not have anybody to rescue her and that she must rely only on herself. When she is taken to the bathroom, she tries to escape again out the window, but discovers that the kidnappers cemented it shut. Olivia is devastated and begins to cry. However, she manages to get a hold of a pipe iron and uses it to knock out one of the kidnappers, and steals his keys and gun. She begins to run towards the red door leading out of the building, but is stopped by the other kidnapper, Otto. Olivia, after much hesitation, shoots and kills Otto. She manages to unlock the red door, but discovers that the small building she is being held in is within a warehouse and that there is no way out. She also discovers that Ian is actually the man holding her hostage as leverage against the president."

Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, lives in a cottage just outside the city with his wife and five daughters. One day, in his office, he reads the drafts of O Lost, a novel by Thomas Wolfe (Jude Law). Struck by the content, Perkins decides to publish it and begins to collaborate with the author. It is eventually published as Look Homeward, Angel and proves to be a commercial success: 15 thousand copies sold in a month. Perkins and Wolfe become best friends, while Wolfe's relationship with Aline Bernstein (Nicole Kidman), a married woman twenty years his senior, is severely tested after the novel's publication. Max manages to publish Wolfe's successful second novel, Of Time and the River, after several years of exhausting revision. Wolfe is in Paris where he follows the events remotely, thanks to news received from Perkins. On his return to New York, he immediately goes to work, writing his new book. His turbulent character leads him to quarrel with Perkins, destroying the relationship between them, resulting in Wolfe turning to another editor.

The following act is shy Western Union messenger Herbie Fenton, who stuns Betty with his amazing singing voice, performing \"Out of This World\". In the audience are Bing Crosby's four sons, even though they are not orphans (due to \"Dad and his horses\"); they recognize the voice right away. Dorothy Dodge, secretary to the orphanage's main benefactor, faints during his performance. A photo of Herbie holding Dorothy up is published in Life magazine. The next day, Betty gets a much-needed job offer in New York, but it stipulates she must bring her male singer: Herbie. She talks him into signing an exclusive contract for fifty dollars per week, an easy task as he is smitten with her. They do not have enough for train fare to New York, but Dorothy gives Betty the money ... in exchange for 25% of Herbie. Then the hotel manager wants his bill paid, so the girls have to sell more shares of the contract. On the train, Betty is horrified to discover they have sold another 100% of Herbie. Betty can only hope that Herbie flops, but she doesn't know that Dorothy hires bobby soxers to scream and swoon at his performance. Later, Betty confides to Herbie that she wants to marry either someone handsome or one with $100,000, explaining that her mother married a vaudeville actor and she wants the security her mother never had. On The Crawford Glamour Hour radio show, Herbie sings \"I'd Rather Be Me\", and the bobby soxers do their job so well that J. C. Crawford, the show's sponsor, pressures Betty into signing a contract ($750 a week for the orchestra and $1000 for Herbie), reminding her that he has an exclusive option on her band. On the train after a performance, Herbie tells Betty he loves her, and he is now worth $100,000. She tells him she feels the same, but asks him to propose later, after she gets something straightened out. She summons all the contract shareholders to New York. When Herbie finds out Betty's financial dealings, he believes Betty lied about everything and quits. Crawford has arranged a big charity event, to be broadcast nationwide (to 50,000,000 potential customers) and featuring Herbie. When he finds out that Herbie refuses to perform, he threatens to sue everyone involved. The other shareholders sell out to Dorothy, who then sells all of Herbie to Crawford for a hefty prof|it. Meanwhile, Betty sees to it that Herbie catches a cold, so he has an excuse not to sing at the event. Crawford does not believe Herbie has lost his voice, so to keep Betty out of jail, Herbie comes up with the idea to lip sync to a recording. Afterward, Dorothy points out that Betty is 19 and, as a minor, cannot be party to a contract. In one of the last numbers at the event, five noted orchestra leader-pianists, Carmen Cavallaro, Ted Fiorito, Henry King, Ray Noble and Joe Reichman, show off their piano talents."

        "content": "Army (\u9678\u8ecd Rikugun) is a 1944 Japanese film directed by Keisuke Kinoshita and starring Chish\u016b Ry\u016b and Kinuyo Tanaka.  It is best known for its final scene, which Japanese World War II censors found troubling. Army tells the story of three generations of a Japanese family and their relationship with the army from the Meiji era through the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.  Ryu plays the man of the middle generation, Tomohiko, and Tanaka his wife Waka.  A large portion of the movie concerns Tomohiko's and Waka's concern that their oldest son Shintaro will be too weak to become a good soldier and their efforts to mold him into one.  Other portions of the movie include Tomohiko's own exclusion from fighting during the Russo-Japanese War due to illness, and his later indignation when a friend suggests that Japan could lose a war. In the wordless final scene of the movie, Shintaro marches off with the army for deployment in the invasion of Manchuria.  Tanaka's character runs alongside him tearfully and expresses her anxiety over his well-being.  Japanese wartime censors were upset by this scene because Japanese mothers in films were supposed be depicted as being proud to send their sons to battle, and not being at all upset about it.  According to film critic Donald Richie, the scene was spared being cut because arguably Tanaka's emotions were caused by her internal conflict between her duty to be happy to send her son off to war and her own selfishness by loving and trying to possess him.  Criterion Collection essayist Michael Koresky and others attribute the fact that the script escaped censorship of this scene to the fact that the scene is wordless, and so in the script it merely states \"The mother sees the son off at the station.\u201d  Koresky attributes the scene's power to purely cinematic elements, i.e., \"expressive cutting, the variations in camera distance, Tanaka\u2019s stunning performance.\" As a result of the final scene, which according to Richie was called \"deplorable and an unnecessary stain on an otherwise fine film,\" Kinoshita was subjected to enhanced attention from the censors until the end of the war.  Reportedly, an army officer stormed into the Shochiku film studio after the film's premiere on November 22, 1944, accusing Kinoshita of treason.  He would not be permitted to release another film until after the war ended. According to author Alexander Jacoby, Army is superficially conformist but the final scene is an expression of Kinoshita's \"antimilitarist sentiments.\"  Kinoshita later stated that \"I can\u2019t lie to myself in my dramas. I couldn\u2019t direct something that was like shaking hands and saying, \u2018Come die.\u2019\u201d"

        "content": "In 1963, brothers Bob and Horatio Huntington run a traveling circus together, doing well in spite of their vastly different personalities. After a show, the circus' resident gypsy fortune teller Esmerelda presents her beautiful niece, Talia, to her employers, asking them to give her a job. Bob and Horatio are both immediately smitten with the lovely woman, but her affections are solely for Bob. When the pair announce their plans to marry, Horatio becomes furious, and delivers an ultimatum to his brother to choose either Talia or himself. Bob marries Talia, and Esmerelda gives them a mysterious box as a wedding gift, which allows them to open a new circus. Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus, known for animals performing amazing, seemingly impossible, feats. Years later, Bob's son Owen marries his childhood friend Zoe at the circus, where they had first met as kids. Following the initial excitement however, Owen soon discovers he now has to work as a taste tester for Zoe's father Mr. Woodley at his dog biscuit factory. Fifteen years later, Horatio, whose luck has taken a serious downturn since his fight with Bob, sneaks into Bob and Talia's dressing rooms, trying to find the secret to the magic animals, and accidentally starts a fire which apparently kills Bob and Talia. Their funeral is attended by Owen, Zoe, and their daughter Mackenzie. Horatio makes an unexpected visit, and announces that he'll be taking over the circus. He and his friends start a fight, causing the Huntingtons to leave. Before they leave, circus pets, Old Blue the dog and Zena the cat, give the Huntingtons the mysterious box, they later discover it holds animal cracker cookies. Owen eats one and turns into a hamster. The Huntingtons return to the circus to figure out how this happened. They learn from clown Chesterfield that the animal crackers will turn the user into the animal they eat, but it contains only one human cookie to change them back. Later, he tells them they inherited the circus. Zoe is excited, but Owen, determined to please Mr. Woodley, decides to continue his job. Zoe restores the circus while Owen stays at the dog biscuit factory. Mr. Woodley, frustrated that Zoe quit her job, begins to consider Brock, an egotistical saboteur, as her replacement. Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus reopens, but is a disaster, upon the discovery of no animals. Owen reluctantly decides to eat the animal crackers and performs stunts as an animal. By the end of the day, Owen grows to like it, and decides to quit his job. As his finishes packing up though, Brock unwittingly eats one of the cookies and turns into a mandrill. To catch up with him, Owen turns into a lion, but Brock gets captured by Horatio's henchman Mario Zucchini, who also steals cookie pieces. Upon returning home, Owen soon discovers he has lost the human cookie, and will remain an animal forever. He attempts to adapt to life as a certain animal but has little success. Binkley, an employee of Mr. Woodley who's trying to create a new type of dog biscuit, discovers the animal crackers and persuades Mr. Woodley to attend the circus. At one performance, Horatio appears and offers Owen his human cookie (which Mario had also unknowingly stolen) in exchange for the circus. Owen however, refuses, thinking that remaining an animal will at least keep his family together, but he is forced into the deal by Horatio's henchmen, who are now mutated animals created from consuming the cookie pieces. The circus performers then come across the scene and a fight breaks out between them and his henchmen. Enraged, Horatio eats some crumbs and turns into a chimera. He is confronted by Old Blue and Zena who reveal themselves as Bob and Talia, alive but forever trapped in animal form due to the destruction of their human cookies in the fire. They ask Horatio to redeem himself, but he refuses. Horatio flies up, grasping them. Owen, Zoe, and Mackenzie, and the other circus performers work together to save Bob and Talia. Upon capturing Horatio, Owen turns him into a hamster as punishment. Bullet Man quotes In Memoriam A.H.H. from Alfred Lord Tennyson: \"I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it when I sorrow most; 'Tis better to have loved and lost. Than never to have loved at all.\" The henchmen are also caged and are gleefully told that since they ate the broken pieces of the animal crackers, their human cookies are in pieces and it will take quite a long time to figure out whose parts go to whom, much to their dismay. Having witnessed the entire fiasco, Mr. Woodley reevaluates his views on both Owen and the circus, and with Binkley, decides to create a new circus souvenir using her failed experiments; animal crackers that cause the eater's skin to temporarily take on the color and patterns of the animal whose cracker they eat. Owen and Zoe now work happily at the circus, with Owen debuting as a dragon."

Following the end of World War II and the liberation of the concentration camps, Nelly returns to Germany with her friend Lene. Here, Lene takes Nelly to a reconstructive plastic surgeon. Although Nelly tells the surgeon that she would like to look exactly as she used to, he is unable to recreate her old face completely and Nelly is disappointed with the final result. Lene finds an apartment for her and Nelly. Since Nelly's family members all died during the war, Nelly has inherited a considerable amount of money. Lene suggests to Nelly that she collect the money and that the two of them travel to Palestine. She believes they will be safe there and can help with the creation of an independent Jewish state. Although Lene warns Nelly that her husband Johnny may have been the one to betray her to the Nazis, Nelly denies this possibility. She leaves the apartment at night to find him. She finds Johnny working in a nightclub called Phoenix. Johnny fails to recognize her, yet says later that she bears an uncanny resemblance to his late wife, Nelly. In order to obtain his wife's inheritance, he asks Nelly to impersonate his wife. Johnny slowly transforms Nelly into an image and performer of her previous self before her arrest. Nelly goes along with Johnny's plan and keeps her true identity concealed, telling Johnny that her name is Esther. Although Lene continues to warn Nelly that Johnny was possibly complicit in her arrest, Nelly maintains a romantic view of the relationship. As Esther, she questions Johnny about his feelings for his wife and his behaviour at the time of her arrest. Johnny avoids answering most of Nelly's questions, wanting her to concentrate on learning to impersonate his wife. Johnny tells Nelly that he plans to stage her \"return\" from the camps within the week, and invites several of the couple's old friends to meet her with him at the train station. After spending several days with Johnny, Nelly returns to the apartment she shares with Lene. Here, the landlady informs her that Lene has killed herself, leaving behind a note for Nelly. In this note, Lene admits to Nelly that she knows that Johnny divorced Nelly the day before her arrest. She includes a copy of the divorce decree, which forces Nelly to accept Johnny's betrayal. Nelly keeps this knowledge a secret, meeting Johnny and their old friends at the train station as planned. Later, at the home of one of the friends, Nelly invites the group to listen to her sing, accompanied by Johnny on piano. As Nelly sings, Johnny recognizes her voice and sees the number tattooed on her arm when she was a prisoner in the concentration camps. He stops playing the piano and shows strong feelings of guilt while Nelly finishes the song and walks away."

The novel was freely adapted into the 1965 J. Lee Thompson film Return from the Ashes. In his adaptation, Christian Petzold decided to change the setting to Berlin shortly after the German surrender at the end of World War II. The screenplay was co-written by Petzold and the artist Harun Farocki. It was the last screenplay of Farocki's career. In the process, the scenarists changed the characters' names and occupations. They eliminated the book's narrative device, in which the survivor's daughter Fabienne discovers the story of her mother's and stepfather/lover's relationship through journal entries written by her mother. She is revealed to have died under suspicious circumstances. They also dropped a secondary plot in which Fabienne has developed a relationship with her stepfather, and thus challenges her mother for his affection when identities are ambiguous."

        "content": "Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) return to the barn and introduce Aaron (Ross Marquand) to Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and the group. Aaron tells them he is part of a larger community surrounded by reinforced steel walls that provide protection from intruders and \"roamers\", and after observing the group believes they would make trustworthy additions to his community. Rick, however, doesn't trust Aaron and knocks him unconscious before tying him to a wooden column. A search of Aaron's pack reveals, among other things, a flare gun, suggesting there are others nearby. When later pressed by Rick, Aaron reveals he has one partner who is hiding some distance from the group. He provides Rick with directions to two waiting vehicles, which are to transport Rick's group to the community. Rick is unwilling to trust him, but Michonne (Danai Gurira) insists they must investigate the possibility of a new home, and Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) agrees. Maggie, Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz), and Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos) also go to see if the vehicles are in fact there, while the rest of the group watch for an attack on the barn. While alone with Rick, Aaron explains that he worked for an NGO delivering food and medicine to communities on the Niger River delta, and \"bad guys\" often threatened him \u2014 but he doesn't believe Rick is a bad guy. Glenn questions why Aaron would want people who have done what the group has done to join him, but Michonne points out that the group has taken in people like Father Gabriel, Tara, and herself. They find a car and an RV for transport, as Aaron said. When everyone reconvenes, Michonne declares that since Aaron appears genuine, they will join the community; no one disagrees. Aaron says he will take them the next morning, but he refuses to reveal the camp's location in order to protect its inhabitants. Instead, Aaron says they'll take Highway 16 and provide further directions as they travel. However, Rick decides against that and declares they will travel via Highway 23 that night. Aaron protests, saying that his people haven't yet cleared that road, but Rick is adamant. Michonne questions whether Rick actually intends to join the camp. Rick responds that it is a struggle to believe anywhere is safe for his family, he will make a decision when he is outside the walls. Rick, Michonne, Glenn, and Aaron take the lead in the car, while the rest of the group follow a short distance behind in the RV. On the way, Michonne is looking at the pictures that Aaron has given her and she asks him why he has no pictures of his people. He says that he did take one picture but that he had got the exposure wrong and it didn't develop. Michonne then asks Rick if he has given Aaron their own audition interview: How many walkers have you killed? How many people have you killed? Why? Aaron answers that he has killed 'lots' of walkers, but only two people, and only then because they were trying to kill him. At that point Rick then finds a parabolic microphone in the car and expresses concern that Aaron's people might have heard their plans. Rick's outburst distracts Glenn, who drives into a herd of walkers on the dark, unscouted highway. Coming out the other side, they lose sight of the RV and conclude it backed away from the herd. They can't get the car started to rendezvous. They see a flare go off and Aaron bolts into the woods, pursued by Glenn. After close calls for each, Glenn cuts Aaron free and returns his pistol, and together they return to the car to save Rick and Michonne from the herd. The four of them head for the flare and reunite with the RV group who have rescued Aaron's partner and boyfriend, Eric (Jordan Woods-Robinson). Relieved that Rick's group saved Eric, Aaron reveals the community is located in Alexandria, Virginia, and Glenn urges Rick to trust Aaron. The group hits the road in the morning. Michonne cautions Rick to allow himself to stop fighting; he slips away to hide a gun in the woods. Pulling up to the community walls, Rick hears the sound of children playing. Believing that Aaron is telling the truth and the community is safe, the group leave the vehicles and heads to the gates."

        "content": "In 2009,  Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) announces to his wife Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) that he is now running the McKinley High glee club. Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is depressed as he starts his second year at McKinley High. Guidance Counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) notices him looking at a pamphlet about suicide, and calls his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to the school. Afterward, Burt tells Kurt that he has to join a team by the end of the week and start making friends. At lunch, Kurt sits at a table with Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), and tells her that he needs to join a club; after finding out that he can sing, she suggests the new glee club. The two of them meet and sing but when Kurt suggests they audition together, Rachel refuses: stars shine separately, and she plans to shine. Kurt then asks Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) for advice, since he has heard that she is a star of her church choir, and also recruits her to audition for the glee club. He auditions, and tells his father that he has joined the club. Burt is unsure but happy for his son, but Kurt hesitates to tell his dad that he is gay. Rachel tries to befriend Mercedes, and asks to come to her church to hear her sing. When she does, Rachel is worried, and tells Mercedes that she has a great future as a soul singer, but Mercedes tells her that whatever type of music is being sung, Rachel will have to compete with her for it. Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) is rebelling by using a fake stutter to drive most people away, and dressing as a goth. She is friends with Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), who really likes her as she is the only one at the school who treats him like a regular human being despite his being in a wheelchair. In the cafeteria, a couple of Tina's goth friends dump food on Rachel and Kurt as a dare, and one dares Tina and Artie back to try out for the glee club. They both do, supporting each other, and each is impressed by the other's singing ability. The first meeting of New Directions is a tense one: Will gives the first solo to Artie, but Rachel insists that she should be getting the solos as she has the best voice, a claim immediately disputed by Mercedes. That night, Terri finds Will working on music for the glee club, and she is concerned that Will's commitment to glee club may cause future issues with their marriage, but Will promises to put her first. Rachel is pleased when Will gives her the next solo, but Mercedes is very upset. She is talked out of quitting by her church choir director (April Grace), who urges her to stay, and predicts that competing with Rachel will ultimately make Mercedes a better singer. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) and Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) praise Sue's leadership of the Cheerios cheerleaders to five consecutive national championships. Sue wonders about the revival of glee club, but Figgins assures her that they are of no concern and that Sue and the Cheerios will always be the center of McKinley High. During her weekly one-on-one basketball game with Will, Sue tells him that it is wrong to encourage the dreams of such young minds, but Will disagrees, and says that glee club could be even more important than cheerleading. Sue gives him an ultimatum: her friendship or the glee club. Will picks the glee club, adding that he just recruited Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), the quarterback of the football team. Sue is furious. Hearing that Terri is pregnant and that Will may be leaving as glee club director to become an accountant, Rachel goes to see Terri to convince her that Will needs to stay at McKinley. Terri is not persuaded in the least. Mercedes and Kurt are having issues with Finn, which they talk over at a coffee shop, where Mercedes has a chance encounter with Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). Artie, Kurt, Mercedes, Rachel, and Tina meet on whether or not to kick out Finn, but they realize that he belongs in glee club as much as they do, and they unanimously vote to keep him in. Emma begs Figgins to give Will a raise so that he can stay on as glee club coach, but Figgins instead finds an old video of Will competing in a glee club championship, which Emma shows to Will. Sue congratulates Will on his departure from teaching, but as he is leaving, he hears the sound of the glee club singing \"Don't Stop Believin' in the auditorium, and he stays to watch them."

Mike refuses to let him exit until he pays cash or provides a court-supplied parking sticker. Jimmy meets with Craig and Betsy Kettleman, who are being investigated for embezzlement. They are hesitant to hire him and when Jimmy later tries to order them flowers while driving, he hits a man on a skateboard. The skateboarder's twin brother records the incident on camera and threatens to call the police unless Jimmy pays them hush money. Recognizing their ruse, Jimmy refuses. Afterward, he returns to his \"office\" \u2013 the boiler room of a Vietnamese beauty salon \u2013 where he finds a check from Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), his brother Chuck's law firm. Jimmy tears up the check and later confronts the partners, accusing them of trying to cheat Chuck with a token payment. On his way out of HHM's office, he sees the Kettlemans entering, which causes him to angrily and repeatedly kick a trash can. Jimmy visits Chuck, who is housebound and believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He has no working lights or appliances and works by lantern on a manual typewriter. Chuck refuses to accept a buyout from HHM and also suggests that Jimmy stop using the McGill name for his law practice. Jimmy tracks down the skateboarders, Cal and Lars, and tells them how he got the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" as a young man by faking \"slip and fall\" accidents to get easy money. He arranges for one of them to be struck by Betsy's car, which will enable him to make another pitch to defend the Kettlemans. Instead of stopping to check on Cal after hitting him, the motorist drives off. Cal and Lars give chase, but when the car stops, an elderly Hispanic woman exits. They try to make her pay and follow her into her house. Jimmy arrives moments later to try and save them but is pulled into the house at gunpoint by Tuco Salamanca."

In August 1989, Whitney invites Bobby to her lavish 26th birthday celebration, where Bobby discovers her abusing cocaine. Whitney begins recording her third album I'm Your Baby Tonight (1990), the relationship between her and Brown continues to blossom consistently, leading to a sexual relationship between the two. Unbeknownst to her, Brown is in a relationship with his girlfriend Kim, who had just given birth to his daughter. Just as Houston discovers this, she is left heartbroken and infuriated. Bobby later severs ties with Kim, and Whitney later manages to pull through and persevere in the already hectic relationship. Sometime later, Brown is unable to replicate the success of his album Don't Be Cruel, as his record label wants him to record a greatest hits compilation. Whitney and Bobby continue to date for a number of years, with Brown proposing to her by late 1991, and the two are married by the summer of 1992. Around this time, Kevin Costner handpicks Houston to star in what will become her film debut The Bodyguard. Though she is initially reluctant, Bobby encourages her to proceed. While on the set of The Bodyguard, Houston suffers a miscarriage, causing her to become very sickly. Cissy visits and persuades Whitney to leave Bobby, but Whitney refuses.

Gina mentions that her boyfriend Choi is running late. Eden introduces Sadie, a girl she and David met in Mexico who is now staying with them. Throughout the evening, Will wanders through his former home and relives memories, including Eden's attempted suicide. In the kitchen, Will witnesses Eden slap Ben when he makes a joke about her ideas on expelling pain. Eden and David's friend Pruitt arrive. David locks the front door, explaining that there was a home invasion in the neighborhood. Will goes outside for firewood and, through Eden's bedroom window, sees Eden hiding a pill bottle that he later learns contains the barbiturate phenobarbital. David and Eden tell their guests about a cult-like group they joined, along with Pruitt and Sadie, called \"The Invitation\", which helps people work through their grief. David shows everyone a video in which the group's leader Dr. Joseph comforts a dying woman as she takes her last breaths. The guests then play a game of \"I Want\" in which Sadie kisses Gina, Eden kisses Ben, and Pruitt confesses to killing his wife and doing time in prison. David tries to convince an unsettled Claire not to leave, but Will challenges him. Claire leaves, accompanied by Pruitt, whose car is blocking Claire's. Will watches Pruitt take Claire out of sight to talk to her, and David confronts Will about being too suspicious. After dinner, Will peers through a cracked door and sees Sadie make odd faces into a mirror. She makes eye contact with him, follows him outside, and startles him with an indecent proposal, which he rejects. Will talks with Tommy about the weird, unsafe atmosphere he feels at the party, but Tommy reassures him that it is natural to feel strange about visiting the house and that Will is brave for showing up. He returns to the party while Will stays outside. Will finally gets a cell phone signal and finds a voice mail from Choi indicating that he was at Eden and David's doorstep before the other guests. Presuming that David and Eden must have done something to Choi, Will angrily confronts the couple about their strange behavior and links to the cult. Choi arrives unexpectedly, explaining that he was called away by work. Will is embarrassed, but the others assume his residual grief over Ty's death is causing him to behave irrationally. Will finds a laptop with a foreboding message from Dr. Joseph. David lights a red lantern in the garden and pours drinks for the guests to toast, but Will smashes the glasses, fearing they are poisoned. Sadie attacks Will, who inadvertently knocks her unconscious in the scuffle. Gina, who had sipped her drink before Will's intervention, collapses and dies. David, Pruitt, and a recovered Sadie attack the guests, killing Miguel, Choi, and Ben. Will, Kira, and Tommy flee and hide in the house. Will overhears David tell Eden that they have been chosen and that finishing what they started is the only way they can leave the Earth and be free of their pain. Tommy fatally wounds Sadie with a fireplace poker. Pruitt finds and attacks Will and Kira, who beats him to death with a wine bottle. Eden shoots Will, wounding him, then remorsefully shoots herself in the stomach. David stalks the survivors with a knife, but Tommy disarms and stabs him to death. Eden apologizes to Will and asks him to take her outside. Will, Kira, and Tommy carry the dying Eden into the garden, where they hear sirens and screams and helicopters overhead. They see more than a dozen nearby homes with red lanterns and realize that Los Angeles is erupting in chaos as other cult members carry out similar plans."

In July 2014, it was revealed that production on the film had concluded, with Logan Marshall-Green, Michiel Huisman, Emayatzy Corinealdi, Lindsay Burdge, and John Carroll Lynch starring. The Invitation is the second feature to be financed by Gamechanger Films.  Kusama was influenced by the slow reveal of Let the Right One In and the unraveling family reunion in Festen.  She cited the film's theme as \"a metaphor for what the nightmare of anxiety really is, which is this irrational sense that people are trying to hurt you somehow\"."

        "content": "Chuck Darling (Kelsey Grammer) is the co-anchor at WURG-TV, News 9, and also the former co-anchor of WURG until New Year's Eve 1996, until he left for a better job, moving through different markets before finally moving to an anchor job in Los Angeles. Ten years later, he made a curse-filled outburst towards a co-worker, Darcy Tanner, which became a massive YouTube sensation. He has now returned to WURG-TV and is once again co-anchor with Kelly Carr. He later finds out he has a child with Kelly named Gracie, a result of a one-night stand the night before he left. He and Gracie get along well, and despite the fact that Gracie is oblivious to his paternity, it seems that Chuck has passed on some of his personality traits to his daughter, which include their mutual dislike for Kelly. He was raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. Kelly Marsha Carr (Patricia Heaton) is Chuck's co-anchor, and was formerly until New Year's Eve 1996 when he left WURG. As a result of getting drunk while doing a report on drunk driving, and later having sex with Chuck, she now has a daughter she conceived with him. When Chuck returned, she wasn't happy, taking every chance to get angry with him. She revealed that her daughter Gracie is in fact Chuck's child. Montana Diaz Herrera (real name Sally Lerner) (Ayda Field) was WURG's purportedly Latina weatherwoman until episode 13 when she was fired.  Montana isn't the most well-educated person, but she will do a lot to make sure people in power like her.  She also has a difficulty pronouncing \"Monongahela\". Her name has disappeared from the credits as of episode 10, because in the plot line for episode 13, she was fired. It is revealed her real name is Sally Lerner. She pretended to be Hispanic because most stations \"only wanted to hire minorities.\" She chose the alias Montana because it was where she used to ice skate, and she chose Diaz Herrera only after mistaking it for \"Happy Days\" in Spanish. It has been alluded that she is Marsh's daughter. Montana/Sally's mother is named Louise Lerner. Ryan Church (Josh Gad) is the news director at WURG. He stated in the pilot that he is 26 (and a half) years old, and his birthday falls in the month of March. He also has a crush on Montana, and repeatedly tries to impress her by doing stupid and dangerous things. He formerly ran the station's internet division. Gracie Carr (Laura Marano then Lily Jackson) is Chuck and Kelly's daughter, though she was unaware that Chuck is her father until episode 11. She and her father Chuck seem to share many qualities, such as their sense of humor and their allergy to pistachios. She recently turned eleven. Lily Jackson replaced Laura Marano starting with the tenth episode, \"The Wall of Fame\", and Gracie reverted to the age of 10. Gary Crezyzewski (pronounced \"Sure-shwoov-ski\") (Ty Burrell) is WURG's field reporter, a position he has held for 12 years. His ambition is to become an anchor, and it has been hinted that he holds a grudge against Chuck because Gary hoped to be the new anchor. He always ends up in awkward and unwanted situations while reporting, which have included, as he explains, \"every freeway chase, toxic spill, and record snowfall\". He was also seen to have been used as a test subject in a taser demonstration. His name is often mis-pronounced by his co-workers, especially Chuck. Gary is married to a woman named Kitty, and their marriage is described as somewhat antagonistic, but loving. Kitty is often mentioned, and usually described as behaving outlandishly, but is never seen on camera  \u2013 much like Maris from Frasier or Vera from Cheers, both programs from Back to You producer Christopher Lloyd. Gary is of Polish descent. Marsh McGinley (Fred Willard) is WURG's fairly dim-witted sports anchor. He throws up before the beginning of each show. He also breaks down while reading \"Casey at the Bat\", because his father used that poem to break his stutter. Could possibly be the father of Montana."

        "content": "In conjunction with the development of the film, the DAU multimedia project was started. Since 2007, thanks to the collaborative, financial, and ideological support of philanthropist Serguei Adoniev, the project began to take new, unique forms, for which it is now renowned. The DAU Institute was built on the site of the former Dynamo Aquatic Stadium in Kharkiv, Ukraine, occupying 12,000 m2. It became the largest film set in Europe and a sort of alternate reality for three years between 2008 and 2011. The project involved scientists, artists, musicians, philosophers, religious figures and mystics, as well as cooks, cleaners, nurses, hairdressers, and secret service agents, all of whom lived and worked at the institute, observing the rules of dynamic historical reconstruction of a period spanning from 1938 to 1968. Cameras recorded the natural behavior of each character in circumstances orchestrated by the director. Everyone, with the exception of Dau (portrayed by Teodor Currentzis), his wife (Radmila Schegoleva), their son (Nikolai Voronov), and Krupitsa, director of the institute from 1938 to 1953 (Anatoly Vasiliev), lived in the institute under their own names. Their biographies were adapted to the new Soviet reality. In total, 392,000 people auditioned for the film. There were two departments at the DAU Institute: the theoretical department, where the actual theoretical physicists worked, and the experimental department, staffed mostly by contemporary artists. Research into the quantum physics concepts of string theory and loop quantum gravity was carried out at the institute. In addition to this, experiments were conducted in less conventional fields, such as orgone energy, teleportation, and superhuman abilities. Ilya Khrzhanovsky's original idea of creating a film about Lev Landau has been transformed through the process of filming into a large-scale study of human nature that continues to this day. At different stages of the project, contemporary artists Marina Abramovi\u0107, Carsten H\u00f6ller, Boris Mikhailov, and Philippe Parreno, among many others, have been involved, as were stage and film directors Peter Sellars, Romeo Castellucci, Anatoly Vasiliev, designers including Rei Kawakubo, musicians Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack) and Brian Eno, and many more."

Though all right, she complains of headaches, and her doctor orders her to give up alcohol.  For the sake of their son Jimmy, Nora and Jim pledge to sober up, but the doctor expresses skepticism when he learns they will be traveling to Ireland to visit Nora's elderly grandmother.  Nora assures her doctor they will purge themselves of all their bad habits there. In Ireland, Nora and Jim stop at a pub to get directions.  While drinking, they run into Joe, one of Nora's old friends.  He warns them that Nora's Uncle Bill has gone insane.  Jim becomes jealous and starts a fight with Joe, and they are thrown out of the pub.  Before they reach the mansion, Nora has another vision and crashes the car.  Though none of them are injured, they are forced to walk the rest of the way.  Alice, a young girl adopted by Bill, leads them there. When Bill offers them drinks, Jim declines, much to Nora's annoyance.  Bill reveals himself to be blind.  After Jim makes several insensitive remarks, Nora takes Jim aside, accuses him of being drunk, and searches his clothes for a hidden flask.  Though Nora is angry when she finds it is empty, Jim says they will restart their sobriety anew together.  Bill suggests that Nora meet her grandmother alone, but she is confused and briefly becomes ill when he leads her to the basement.  There, he reveals a preserved bog body, which he explains is a Druid witch named Niamh.  Meanwhile, Jim encounters Nora's grandmother, who attacks him and wanders off.  When Bill describes his belief that Niamh will come back to life, Nora returns upstairs, though she is surprised to see Niamh apparently open her eyes. Nora tells Jim that they should leave the next day, as Joe was right about Bill.  Concerned for their safety amid crazy relatives, Jim and Nora move Jimmy into their room.  When they lie down, they discover Druidic relics hidden under their mattress.  Bill and Alice look for Nora's grandmother and lead her back to her bedroom.  When Bill returns to the basement, Niamh, now a lookalike of Nora, comes to life.  After Bill kisses her, Niamh slits his throat, decapitates him, and goes upstairs.  At the same time, Nora's behavior becomes erratic, and she tells Jim that she left Ireland for America after having an abortion. Jim goes downstairs to drink, where he eventually encounters Niamh.  Mistaking her for Nora, Jim kisses her.  When he becomes uncomfortable with the idea of public sex, they stop and he lights cigarettes for them both. She accidentally sets her robe on fire, and runs outside.  Jim follows, only to run into Joe. They argue, and Joe knocks him out.  Joe enters the house and seduces Nora. Jim finds them, and Nora hits him as he attempts to pull her away from Joe. Then Niamh comes back inside, and seeing both Nora and Niamh, Jim becomes confused.   When Niamh attacks them, the gardener, Sean, saves them by shooting Niamh.  When she revives and kills Joe, they retreat to the kitchen, where they electrocute her, and her burning body falls through the floor.  Alice explains that Niamh intends to steal Nora's body and soul.  When Jimmy stands too close to the hole, Niamh grabs him.  Nora jumps through the hole, and the others race downstairs. Nora encounters her grandmother, who upon hearing that Nora is willing to sacrifice herself to save Jimmy, encourages her to do so.  Nora and Niamh begin showing shared personalities.  Noticing this, Jim uses Nora's alcoholism to keep Niamh occupied.  Niamh eventually flees outside with Jimmy, where Nora confronts her.  Remembering her grandmother's advice, Nora slits her throat and jumps into the ocean, as Niamh watches.  When Jim arrives, Niamh says that everything is alright, as Nora has purged herself of the Druid's influence and taken over Niamh's body.  Niamh \u2013 now Nora \u2013 and Jim embrace, and Alice says that Nora has finally shed herself of her fears and weaknesses."
