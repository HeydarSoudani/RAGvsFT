        "content": "Port Adelaide Football Club is a professional Australian rules football club based in Alberton, South Australia. The club's senior team plays in the Australian Football League , where they are nicknamed the Power, whilst its reserves team competes in the South Australian National Football League , where they are nicknamed the Magpies. Since its founding, the club has won an unequalled 36 SANFL premierships and 4 Championship of Australia titles, in addition to an AFL Premiership in 2004. Founded in 1870, the club is the oldest professional football club in South Australia and the fifth-oldest club in the AFL. Port Adelaide was a founding member of the South Australian Football Association , later renamed as the SANFL. Port Adelaide has repeatedly asserted itself as a dominant force within South Australian football, going undefeated in all competitions in 1914, and enjoying sustained periods of success under coaches Fos Williams and John Cahill, sharing a combined 19 premierships between them. After entering the AFL in 1997, the club claimed three minor premierships and a premiership under coach Mark Williams between 2002 and 2004. Port Adelaide holds a unique status among AFL clubs, being the only pre-existing non-Victorian club to have entered the AFL from another league. Port Adelaide has a long-standing rivalry with fellow SANFL club Norwood, as well as an intense rivalry with the Adelaide Crows in the AFL; a fixture referred to as the 'Showdown'. The club has played at their SANFL home ground, Alberton Oval, since 1880 and has used their AFL home ground, Adelaide Oval, since 2014. Port Adelaide first adopted the colours black and white in 1902, with their 'Prison Bar' guernsey. Following its entry to the AFL, the club adopted the colours of teal and silver, in order to differentiate it from Collingwood."

        "content": "Port Adelaide was formed on 12 May 1870 as a joint football and cricket club, created by locals to benefit the growing number of workers associated with the surrounding wharves and industries of Port Adelaide. The first training session of the newly formed club took place two days later. The Port Adelaide Football Club played its first match against a newly established club from North Adelaide called the Young Australian. Prior to 1877, football in South Australia was yet to be formally organised by a single body and as a result there were two main sets of rules in use across the state. In an effort to create a common set of rules, Port Adelaide was invited to join seven other clubs in the formation of the South Australian Football Association , the first ever governing body of Australian rules football. In 1879, the club played reigning Victorian Football Association premiers Geelong at Adelaide Oval in what was Port Adelaide's first game against an interstate club. It played its first match outside of South Australia two years later, when it travelled to Victoria to contest a game against the Sale Football Club. The club won its first premiership in 1884, when it ended Norwood's run of six consecutive premierships. It later contested the SAFA's first grand final in 1889, as Port Adelaide and Norwood had finished the season with equal minor round records. Norwood went on to defeat Port Adelaide by two goals. Port Adelaide won its second SAFA premiership the following year, and went on to be crowned \"Champions of Australia\" for the first time after defeating VFA premiers South Melbourne. As the 1890s continued, Australia was affected by a severe depression that forced many players to move interstate to find work. This exodus translated into poor on field results for the club. By 1896, the club was in crisis and finished last, causing the club's committee to meet with the aim of revitalising the club. The revitalisation had immediate results, helping Port Adelaide win a third premiership in 1897, one of only four occurrences since 1877 where a team won a premiership after finishing last the previous year. Stan Malin won Port Adelaide's first Magarey Medal in 1899. During the 19th century the club had nicknames including the Cockledivers, the Seaside Men, the Seasiders and the Magentas. In 1900, Port finished bottom in the six-team competition, which it has not done in any senior league since."

        "content": "Port Adelaide began wearing black and white guernseys in 1902 after it was having trouble finding dyes that would last for its blue and magenta guernseys. After finishing the 1902 season on top of the ladder, Port Adelaide was disqualified from their finals game against  after the club disputed the use of an unaccredited umpire. The 1902 SAFA premiership was subsequently awarded to North Adelaide after they defeated South Adelaide in the Grand Final a week later. Port Adelaide offered to play North Adelaide after the conclusion of the season, but the SAFA refused to allow it. Port Adelaide won the premiership the following year. In the early 1910s, Port Adelaide became a consistent premiership contender, setting up the club to win three more Championships of Australia. Port Adelaide won the South Australian Football League premiership in 1910 defeating Sturt 8.12 to 5.11 in the Grand Final. The club would go on to defeat Collingwood for the 1910 Championship of Australia title, and Western Australian Football League premiers East Fremantle in an exhibition match. They also defeated a combination of some of the WAFL's best players in another match. Although Port Adelaide had success in the minor rounds the following two seasons, dropping only one game in 1911 and going undefeated in 1912, it was knocked out of contention by West Adelaide both times. The club won the SAFL premiership in 1913, dropping only two games during the minor round and defeating North Adelaide in the Grand Final. They also defeated Fitzroy for the 1913 Championship of Australia. The 1914 Port Adelaide Football Club season is unique in SANFL history, being the only occasion in which a team has gone undefeated. The club won all its pre-season matches, won all fourteen SAFL games and the 1914 SAFL Grand Final where it held North Adelaide to a single goal for the match 13.15 to 1.8 . It also became the first to score over 1000 points during the minor round. The club met Victorian Football League premiers Carlton in the Championship of Australia, defeating them by 34 points to claim a record fourth title. At the end of the 1914 season, a combined team from the six other SAFL clubs played Port Adelaide and lost to the subsequently-dubbed \"Invincibles\" by 58 points."

        "content": "Port Adelaide's early-century success was hindered by World War I. During the war, the club lost three players as casualties. A scaled-back competition referred to as the 'Patriotic League' was organised during wartime in which Port Adelaide won the 1916 and 1917 instalments. Port Adelaide initially struggled to replicate its past success after the war. After eventually winning the 1921 premiership under the captaincy of Harold Oliver, many of Port Adelaide's champion players from before the war started to retire and the club's performance declined. It won only a single premiership between 1922 and 1935. By the mid 1930s, Port Adelaide's form began to recover. It suffered two narrow grand final losses in 1934 and 1935, before winning consecutive premierships the following two years. During 1939, Bob Quinn, in his third year as a player for the club, coached the team to a Grand Final win over West Torrens. Many Port Adelaide players also enlisted for military service during this time. The club suffered six player casualties during the war. Just as had happened in 1914, the league was hit hard by player losses in World War II. Due to a lack of able men, the league's eight teams were reduced to four and Port Adelaide temporarily merged with nearby West Torrens from 1942 to 1944. The joint club played in all three Grand Finals during this period, winning the 1942 instalment, but losing the 1943 and 1944 editions to the Norwood-North Adelaide combination. While normal competition resumed in 1945, Port Adelaide was unable to regain its pre-war success in the rest of the decade. In particular, it lost the 1945 SANFL Grand Final after a remarkable comeback from West Torrens. The 'All Australian', predecessor to the modern 'All-Australian' team, was created by Sporting Life magazine in 1947, with Bob Quinn being named in the side as captain."

        "content": "During the 1950s, Port Adelaide reestablished itself as a perennial contender, winning seven premierships. At the end of the 1949, having missed two finals series in a row, the Port Adelaide Football Club's committee sought out a coach that could win the club its next premiership. Following a failed attempt to obtain Jim Deane, the decision was made to appoint Fos Williams, a rover from West Adelaide. In his second season as player-coach in 1951, Williams led the club to their first standalone premiership in 12 seasons, defeating North Adelaide by 11 points. In the 1951 post-season, Port Adelaide lost an exhibition match to VFL premiers . In the mid-1950s, Port Adelaide and Melbourne, often the premiers of South Australian and Victorian leagues respectively, played exhibition matches at Norwood Oval. The most notable game was the 1955 match, which had an estimated crowd of 23,000. The match went down to the last 15 seconds when Frank Adams kicked a decisive behind to give Melbourne a one-point victory. Geof Motley took over the captain-coaching role at the club in 1959 when Williams retired from his playing career and also took a break from coaching. That year, the club won the premiership and equalled a national record of six consecutive Grand Final victories, having won each premiership from 1954 to 1959. Port Adelaide's premiership streak was brought to an end in the 1960 preliminary final with a 27-point loss to Norwood. Williams returned in 1962, and coached Port Adelaide to win three of the next four premierships. In 1965 he coached his ninth and last premiership in front of 62,543 people, the largest-ever crowd at Adelaide Oval. After the 1965 Grand Final, Port Adelaide's success was limited by the dominance of Sturt, which won seven premierships over this period under the leadership of Jack Oatey. Despite playing in 6 of the next 10 grand finals, Port Adelaide failed to win another premiership in that span."

        "content": "One of Port Adelaide's leading players during the Fos Williams era was John Cahill. After retiring from playing in 1973 and following the departure of Fos Williams to West Adelaide in 1974, he took over as coach and began another era of premiership success for the club. In 1976, Cahill took Port Adelaide to its first Grand Final under his leadership, facing Sturt. Sturt won in front of an official attendance of 66,897, the record for football in South Australia. The actual crowd was estimated at 80,000, much bigger than the official figure. The following year, Port Adelaide won the premiership to break a 12-year drought. The 1980 season was Port Adelaide's most dominant since 1914. The club completed its fourth ever 'Triple Crown', winning the premiership, Magarey Medal and having the SANFL's leading goalkicker in a single season. The Magarey Medal was awarded to Russell Ebert for a record 4th time and Tim Evans set the then-league goal kicking record of 146 goals in a season. The club set a new record for most points scored during a season at 3,176, whilst also having conceding only 1,687 points. The club's win-loss record was 19\u20132 with one draw and a  of 65.31, its best percentage since 1914. Following the 1982 season, Cahill was offered a contract by  to coach their club in the VFL. In his stead, Russell Ebert became coach in 1983. During his five years as coach, Port Adelaide made the finals three times, and achieved a win rate of above 55%. John Cahill returned as coach from the 1988 season, winning the premiership that year. He won a further five premierships, totalling a record-equalling ten over his coaching career. Two key events of the late 1980s were attempts by the VFL to further expand outside of Victoria and financial difficulties in the SANFL. In 1989, seven of the ten SANFL clubs were recording losses and the combined income of the SANFL and WAFL had dropped to 40% of that of the VFL. During May 1990, the SANFL clubs unanimously accepted a SANFL proposal to not enter a club from South Australia until 1993. Weeks later, Port Adelaide, suffering from a mixture of ambition and frustration, started secret negotiations with the VFL in the town of Quorn for entry to the competition in 1991. When knowledge of Port Adelaide's negotiations to gain an AFL licence were made public, the other nine SANFL clubs called a crisis meeting to discuss options. Plans were made to kick Port Adelaide out of the SANFL should they succeed, and to prevent them from using Football Park as a home ground. SANFL clubs urged Justice Olssen to make an injunction against the bid, which he agreed to. During these meetings, an option was discussed to make a counter offer to the AFL. On the 16th of August, the SANFL officially launched a submission for a composite team. After legal action from all parties, the AFL agreed to accept the SANFL's bid to enter the composite team, which was named the Adelaide Football Club. During December 1994, Max Basher announced that Port Adelaide had won the tender for the second South Australian AFL licence on the condition that a merger take place between two existing AFL clubs to keep the league at the club limit imposed by the AFL in 1993. As such, the licence would not be made available until at least 1996, and was not guaranteed. With the merger of the Brisbane Bears and  looming, the club was advised on 21 May 1996 by the AFL that they would take part in the 1997 AFL season."

        "content": "Following confirmation of their entry in 1997, the club began preparations to enter the league. John Cahill began the transition to the AFL, with Stephen Williams, a son of Fos Williams, taking over the SANFL coaching position from midway through the 1996 season. Cahill then set about forming a group which would form the inaugural squad. Brownlow Medallist and 1990 Port Adelaide premiership player, Gavin Wanganeen, was signed from Essendon and made captain of a team made up of six existing Port Adelaide players, two from the Adelaide Crows, seven players from other SANFL clubs and 14 recruits from interstate. The AFL's father-son rule for the club was set at 200 games for SANFL players before 1997, compared to only 100 for Victorian clubs. On 29 March 1997, Port Adelaide played its first AFL premiership match against Collingwood at the MCG, suffering a 79-point defeat. It won its first AFL game in round 3 against Geelong, and defeated cross town rivals and eventual premiers Adelaide by 11 points in the first Showdown in round 4. The club finished its first season 9th, missing the finals on percentage behind Brisbane. Following the 1998 season, John Cahill retired from his coaching position. In 1999 Mark Williams, another son of Fos Williams, took over as coach of Port Adelaide and led the club to many notable first achievements in the AFL over the next decade. They earned a spot in the AFL finals for the first time in Williams's first season. They were eliminated by eventual premier, North Melbourne, by 44 points in their qualifying final. Port Adelaide had a very successful 2001 season, starting with a maiden pre-season competition victory. Port Adelaide finished their 2001 home and away season in third place, though the club would lose both finals it contested. In 2002, Port Adelaide built on its success and won its first AFL minor premiership. However, they lost to the eventual premiers, the Brisbane Lions in the preliminary final. Port Adelaide continued its minor round dominance in 2003 and again claimed the minor premiership; however like the previous year, Port Adelaide was eliminated in the preliminary final. The 2004 season started strongly for Port Adelaide, winning five of their first six matches. Although they lost three of their next five games, the club would only lose a single game between Round 12 and the end of the minor round. This resulted in the club claiming the minor premiership for third consecutive year. Port Adelaide won its qualifying final against Geelong, earning a home preliminary final. Port Adelaide made it through to its first AFL grand final after defeating St Kilda in a preliminary final by six points, with Gavin Wanganeen kicking the winning goal. The following week Port Adelaide faced the Brisbane Lions, who were attempting to win a record-equalling fourth straight AFL premiership. Port Adelaide led by 15 points at quarter time, but a strong second quarter by Brisbane meant only one point separated the sides at half time. Late in the third quarter Port Adelaide took the ascendency to lead by 17 points at three-quarter time, and dominated the final term to win by 40 points: 17.11 to 10.13 . Byron Pickett was awarded with the Norm Smith Medal for being judged the best player in the match, tallying 20 disposals and kicking three goals. Port Adelaide had limited success in the middle of the decade. In 2005, the club made the finals for the fifth consecutive season, where they contested the only Showdown final to date, with rivals Adelaide winning by 83 points. In 2007, Port Adelaide finished the minor round second on the ladder with 15\u20137 record. They reached that year's grand final, where they were defeated by Geelong by an AFL record margin of 119 points, 24.19 to 6.8 . Following their second grand final, Port Adelaide began experiencing financial troubles and also saw a decline in performance. By 2009, the club had accumulated a consolidated debt totalling $5.1\u00a0million and was unable to pay its players; they had lost $1.6\u00a0million the season before. The AFL delayed giving the club financial support, instead urging it to sort out deals with SANFL as a predecessor to any league support. On 20 May, Port were handed $2.5\u00a0million in debt relief by the SANFL, and on 15 June were handed a $1\u00a0million grant by the AFL commission. Plans for a re-merging of the two teams was rejected by the SANFL early during 2010, though they eventually signed off on the proposal during November 2010. The 2010 season saw Mark Williams step down as senior coach. Matthew Primus took over as caretaker coach for Port Adelaide after Mark Williams stood down. He led the club to five wins from its final seven games."

Despite underwriting $5\u00a0million of Port's debt in 2010, the takeover failed when the SANFL was unable to get a line of credit to cover Port Adelaide's future debts. After the failure of the takeover, AFL Chief executive Andrew Demetriou offered $9\u00a0million over the next three years to help the club, ahead of the move to the Adelaide Oval. Port Adelaide suffered its worst season result in 141 years, finishing sixteenth with 3 wins for the season. Rounds 20 and 21 saw the club lose to  and Hawthorn by record margins of 138 and 165 respectively. The following season, Matthew Primus stepped down from his position as coach, following a loss to . On 8 October 2012, Ken Hinkley was announced as the new senior coach of the club. During the same week, David Koch was named chairman of the club and numerous board members were replaced. The club finished the home and away season 7th on the ladder, qualifying for finals for the first time since 2007. Port travelled to Melbourne to play Collingwood at the MCG in an Elimination Final where they won by 24 points; they then lost to Geelong by 16 points the following week in a Semi-final. The 2014 season saw both Port Adelaide and Adelaide move their home ground from Football Park to the redeveloped Adelaide Oval. Port Adelaide signed up a record 48,968 members for the 2014 season, an increase of 23% from the previous year, and averaged 44,824 at home games. Port Adelaide finished fifth on the ladder, with a win-loss record of 14\u20138. They hosted Richmond in the elimination finals, kicking the first seven goals of the game and leading by as much as 87 points before recording a 57-point victory. After defeating  in the semi-finals, the club's season ended with a three-point loss to Hawthorn in the preliminary finals. In 2017, Port Adelaide made finals after winning 14 games to finish fifth on the ladder. Port Adelaide's season came to an end in an elimination final loss to  by 2 points in extra time. In the 2020 AFL season, Port Adelaide qualified for the finals as minor premiers for the first time since 2004, making it to the preliminary final and being defeated by eventual premiers  by 6 points. Port Adelaide returned to the AFL finals in the 2021 season, finishing in second place at the end of the home-and-away season and qualifying for a second consecutive preliminary final, where they were defeated by the Western Bulldogs by 71 points. Despite this, Ollie Wines became the first Port Adelaide player to win the Brownlow Medal, the league's highest individual honour, winning the award with a record-equalling tally of votes."

        "content": "Port Adelaide first showed interest in an AFL Women's side in 2015. The club signed Erin Phillips as their marquee player in the event that the club was admitted to the AFLW for the 2017 season. However, logistical demands related to the club's China program prevented the club from submitting a bid. The club subsequently attempted to enter a side in the SANFL Women's League , but this approach was rejected by the South Australian Football Commission. In May 2021, the AFL Commission announced that the remaining four clubs without AFLW teams would be admitted to the competition by the end of 2023, with the clubs to bid for entry order. Port Adelaide's bid to enter the competition was successful, with the AFL Commission deciding all four clubs would debut in the AFLW in the 2022/23 season. SANFL presence As part of Port Adelaide's initial bid for the 1994 AFL license, the club had no plans to maintain a presence in the SANFL. After winning the tender for the license however, an agreement was created with the SANFL for Port Adelaide to field two separate clubs in the SANFL and AFL, at the request of the other SANFL clubs. This agreement resulted in the creation of the Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club, a separate legal entity to Port Adelaide Football Club. For the first few years after 1997, the Port Adelaide Magpies were forced to train at Ethelton to ensure they would not gain any advantage using the upgraded Alberton training facilities. Additionally, Port Adelaide AFL-listed players who were not selected for the senior team were randomly drafted to SANFL clubs to play reserves matches until the two Port Adelaide entities merged. This arrangement was necessitated as the other SANFL clubs did not want the reserves side to gain any use of the senior side in the AFL's resources, fearing any potential advantages would be too strong in the SANFL. Australian football historian John Devaney described the forced separation of Port Adelaide's SANFL and AFL operations as being \"akin to the enforced splitting up of families associated with military conquest or warfare\". In response to financial trouble suffered by both Port Adelaide entities, the \"One Port Adelaide Football Club\" movement was launched by former players Tim Ginever and George Fiacchi on 20 August 2010, in an effort to merge Port Adelaide's AFL and SANFL operations. A website was created that claimed 50,000 signatures were needed for the merger. On 16 November 2010, following approval from all nine SANFL clubs, the club formalised the off-field merger between the two entities. On 10 September 2013, Port Adelaide and the SANFL agreed to a model to allow all its AFL-listed players to play for the SANFL side. As part of the arrangement, the club lost its recruiting zones and could no longer field sides in the junior SANFL competitions, and as a result established an 18 to 22 year old academy training team to compete in the league's reserves competition. In 2018, Port Adelaide and the league jointly agreed that it would no longer field a team in the SANFL Reserves competition. Port Adelaide initially still had success in the SANFL after accession into the AFL, with the Port Adelaide Magpies winning back to back Grand Finals in 1998 and 1999. However, the club would not make another grand final until the 2014 season, where it was defeated by Norwood by four points. Port Adelaide featured in two further grand finals against Sturt and Glenelg, though it would be defeated in both. The club did not field a team in the SANFL in the 2020 season due to AFL restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, though it re-joined the competition in 2021."

The tradition was cemented, at least in the view of then-secretary Charles Hayter, when in 1929 he received a letter from a junior Kilkenny player requesting a number one Port Adelaide guernsey as he had just become captain of his underage team. Hayter granted the wish of the junior and provided him with a number one Port Adelaide guernsey. Since 1924, there have been few exceptions to the tradition. The most notable exception was Geof Motley, who followed the captaincy of Fos Williams. Following his appointment as captain-coach, Motley elected to continue wearing the number 17, and continued to do so for the remainder of his career. When Motley handed the captaincy to John Cahill in 1967, at the insistence of coach Fos Williams, the tradition of Port Adelaide captains wearing the number one guernsey resumed. When co-captains were appointed for the 2019 season the No. 1 guernsey was temporarily retired. It was re-instated the following season when the club returned to appointing a single captain."

During the early 1900s, it was commonplace that touring teams would wear numbers, allowing spectators to identify unknown footballers. Port Adelaide attached a white square to the back of its guernsey, with black numbers to be printed on the square. This design would continue to be used after the introduction of numbers into the SANFL, and was interchangeably with a black square and white numbers. The design bearing the black square eventually became the design of choice until 1928. The club introduced a 'permanent' white panel for the 1928 season, which would remain until the club was forced to merge with West Torrens during WWII. The club reintroduced the panel in 1953 and has since continuously used it in the SANFL. The panel was also present on the club's AFL guernsey until it was phased out in 2009. The number panel returned to the club's guernsey in 2017. The white panel is also intended to resemble the white back of a local Magpie species that is present on the badge of South Australia."

        "content": "Historically, the black and white 'Prison Bar' guernsey, alternatively and historically known as the Wharf Pylon guernsey, has been Port Adelaide's most iconic guernsey design. The club first adopted the guernsey in the 1902 season, after having difficulty finding magenta and blue dyes that could repeatedly last the rigours of an Australian rules football match. The guernsey was designed to be a literal depiction of the wharves and pylons that were prominent along the docks of Port Adelaide at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to adopting the guernsey the club had won 3 premierships over 31 years. After adopting the guernsey, the club won 33 premierships and 3 Championships of Australia. The Prison Bar nickname first originated from fans of rival football clubs, in particular those of . The nickname was used in a derogatory fashion, in an attempt to liken the club to a criminal stereotype. The nickname first appeared in media in early 1993, in a match report written by former cricketer Alan Shiell. The nickname was subsequently accepted by the Port Adelaide fanbase, becoming a popular nickname for the design among fans. Upon joining the AFL, Port Adelaide, along with being required to find a new logo, song and nickname, was also forced to replace the Prison Bar guernsey because existing club Collingwood, already using the Magpie logo and nickname, also wore a similar guernsey with vertical black and white stripes. A new guernsey was ultimately created, incorporating teal into its design. Since the club's entry to the AFL, Port Adelaide has made numerous requests to the AFL to wear the Prison Bar guernsey in specific games, only some of which have been approved. The club was first granted the right to wear an AFL-approved Prison Bar guernsey in the Heritage Round of the 2003 season. During 2007, following controversy the year prior in which the AFL declined Port Adelaide the right to wear their heritage guernsey, the AFL and Port Adelaide reached an agreement whereby the club could wear its traditional guernsey in the heritage round, with the proviso that in future seasons its players can only wear it in home heritage round games and provided that such a game is not against Collingwood. No heritage rounds have been held since this agreement was reached. In 2014, the AFL declined Port Adelaide permission to wear its traditional guernsey for celebrating of 100 years since its 1914 Championship of Australia. On 2 September 2014, the AFL cleared the club to use the guernsey in their final against , following controversy about their prior decision to have Port Adelaide wear their clash strip. For their 150th anniversary, the club was granted permission to wear the guernsey in its Showdown match in the 2020 season. The following year, Port Adelaide requested permission to permanently wear the guernsey in all future Showdown matches, but this proposal was rejected by the AFL. Support for the guernsey remains extremely high, with a merchandise for a game against Carlton in 2013 generating over $500,000. On 9 September 2020, it was revealed that memorabilia associated with the Prison Bar guernsey raised $2,000,000 for the club in 2020 and the Prison Bar guernsey itself was the highest selling piece of merchandise in the AFL that year. Towards the end of 2018, a group of supporters organised to push for the return of the club's traditional guernsey full time from the start of the 2020 AFL season, to coincide with the club's 150th anniversary year, and a supporter petition in 2019 calling for the reinstatement of the guernsey reached 10,000 signatures. On the 29 July 2021 club president David Koch revealed that if the club wore the Prison Bar guernsey without permission it would be deducted four premiership points along with a fine."

        "content": "Port Adelaide has adopted different insignia on several occasions throughout its history. Up until 2020, all of the club's insignia in the SANFL were designed around featuring one or multiple Magpies. The original club crest, adopted in 1900, featured a tan football and magpies perched on a gum tree with a black and white striped flag on the left and the Australian Red Ensign on the right. The ensign switched to blue sporadically through the 1910s before the flags were dropped in 1928. From 1930 until 2019, the logo always featured a dexter magpie, perched upon a gum branch or a fence wire . The last Magpies-specific logo, used by the club between 1975 and 2019 in the SANFL, was situated inside a circular disc as was the case at all other SANFL clubs. It made mention of \"Magpies\" in the logo for the first time and was the longest standing in the club's history. Upon entering the AFL in 1997, Port were required to adopt colours and an insignia that distinguished it from , who already had the nickname of the 'Magpies'. The club designed a new logo with a silver fist clutching a lightning bolt, in front of both a Prison Bar design and teal background, showcasing both new colours the club adopted. The logo was slightly altered in 2001 with the lightning bolt and fist defined and the reference to \"Port\" dropped. Ahead of the 2020 season, Port Adelaide's 150th anniversary, the club unveiled a commemorative logo to be worn by both the senior AFL team and reserves SANFL team. The logo features the \"PA\" acronym, 1870 to acknowledge the foundation year, the black-and-white prison bars, the chevron design of the AFL guernsey and a teal outline. Although initially intended to be used exclusively in 2020, feedback from supporters, key stakeholders and investors prompted the club to retain the logo in 2021 and beyond."

        "content": "Over the years, Port Adelaide has used various songs and music at its games. The club has had two main official songs in the SANFL and one in the AFL, in addition to other songs representing the club unofficially. In its first season during 1870 the club invited local brass bands to play during the club's first games at Glanville. In 1882 a song based on Harry Clifton's \"Work, Boys, Work \" was written for the club as a tribute to the recently retired player Thomas Smith. Following the end of the First World War, the club adopted the song was \"The Pride of Port Adelaide is my football team\". The song remained in use until 1971, when Port Adelaide secretary Bob McLean decided to change the club song to \"Cheer, Cheer the Black and the White\" after hearing the South Melbourne Football Club's song based on the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team's \"Victory March\". As Sydney was already using the Notre Dame Victory March when Port Adelaide entered the AFL, the club was forced to find a new song. \"Cheer, Cheer the Black and the White\" is still used by the club in the SANFL competition. Due to the club's need for a new song upon their entry to the AFL, Port Adelaide adopted \"Power to Win\", written for the club by Quentin Eyers and Les Kaczmarek. The song was first played at AFL level after Port Adelaide's win against Geelong in Round 3, 1997 at Football Park. Since 2016, an alternative Pitjantjatjara language version of the song has been used by the club on occasions such as Indigenous Round. As the club's official nickname was shortened to 'The Power', rather than the original 'Port Power'. the line in the song \"..til the flag is ours for the taking, Port Power!\" was eventually changed, removing the word 'Port' and the song was re-recorded. Since March 2014, Port Adelaide has used \"Never Tear Us Apart\" by the Australian band INXS as the club's unofficial anthem leading up to the opening bounce at its new home of Adelaide Oval. The song is used as a reference to the various and unique difficulties the club faced when trying to enter the AFL, primarily in regards to the separation of its SANFL and AFL operations. Port Adelaide's use of the song stemmed from a trip the club took to Anfield in November 2012 while they were in England to play an exhibition match against the Western Bulldogs. During a meeting in mid 2013, the idea of an anthem was raised and \"Never Tear Us Apart\" by INXS was suggested by Port Adelaide's events manager, Tara MacLeod. Initially the song was introduced to coincide with the 60-second countdown before the start of a match, with the music playing over the top of a video montage. The song proved to be a success among the fans, with them adopting the song as well as raising scarves above their heads as the song was being sung."

        "content": "Glanville Hall Estate/Buck's Flat After foundation, it was decided by the inaugural president of Port Adelaide, John Hart Jr., that the club's home ground would be Glanville Hall Estate , a property owned by his immediate family. The area in which the teams played was often referred to as 'Buck's Flat'. The club was forced to cease using the ground following 1879, as the property was sold at an auction. Alberton Oval Alberton Oval has been Port Adelaide's home ground in the SANFL since 1880, excluding 1975 and 1976. Following the end of its operations at Glanville Hall, Port Adelaide was forced to find a new ground to operate from. It was decided that the club would use Alberton Oval for the 1880 season. On 15 May 1880, Port Adelaide played its first match at Alberton Oval. The following year, the decision was made by the club to start leasing the oval from the Port Adelaide Council for the sum of 10 shillings a year. The oval is also used for training purposes for both AFL and SANFL operations, aside from 1997 through 2001 when SANFL training temporarily moved to Ethelton. In 1975 and 1976, Port Adelaide was temporarily locked out of the ground following a dispute between the Port Adelaide Council, the SANFL and the Club over seating arrangements at the ground. The club usually split its seating revenue 50/50 with the SANFL during this time period, an arrangement the SANFL held with each club. However, the Port Adelaide Council wanted to take 50% of all game day revenue, leaving the remaining half to the two to split between themselves. In 1975, the SANFL refused to accept the offer for the ground provided by the council, resulting in the temporary suspension of Port Adelaide's lease on the ground. This prevented Port Adelaide from playing any games at the venue and, the following year, training at the venue. With the 1977 season pending, the issues between the council and the club were resolved and the club was permitted to return that year. The ground possesses two notable grandstands named after individuals important to the club. The Fos Williams Family Stand is the oldest remaining structure at Alberton Oval, first constructed in 1903. The other grandstand, the Robert B. Quinn MM Grandstand, was first opened in 1972. The ground also has the bordering Allan Scott Power Headquarters for the administration of Port Adelaide, which opened in 1999 and is named after the club's initial major sponsor. Football Park Port Adelaide first played at Football Park on 15 June 1974. Despite not being officially recognised as a 'home ground' in the SANFL, it hosted night matches for every team, as well as all finals between 1974 and 2014 regardless of 'home' team. During 1975 and 1976, Port Adelaide sold some of their home games to Football Park. Upon the club's entry to the AFL, fellow South Australian club  was already using the ground for their home matches. Port Adelaide was assigned the ground as its home venue, alongside its existing tenants. Port Adelaide's first official AFL match at the ground was on 6 April 1997, where they were defeated by Essendon by 33 points. Planned upgrades to the stadium were cancelled following news that Port Adelaide, alongside both Adelaide and the SANFL, would make use of Adelaide Oval from 2014 onward, as it had been recently redeveloped. It hosted its final AFL match on the 31st of August that year, where Port Adelaide was defeated by a point by Carlton. The ground remains the headquarters of Adelaide, though features such as the ground's grandstands have been demolished. Adelaide Oval Since 2014, Adelaide Oval has been the home ground of Port Adelaide's AFL team, shared with . Adelaide Oval has historically been used for SANFL Finals and the Championship of Australia match.  During the 1975 and 1976 seasons, Port Adelaide's SANFL Team was forced to play out of the ground following their dispute with the local council, using it for both match day playing and training purposes over the period. Its role as the primary venue for SANFL finals was supplanted by Football Park in 1974, following disagreements between the SANFL and South Australian Cricket Association . Following extensive redevelopment in the early 2010s and negotiations between the SANFL and SACA over the use of the ground, the ground was cleared for football usage purposes, allowing Port Adelaide to use the ground as its home ground from the 2014 season onwards. Port Adelaide also played the first official AFL match at the venue in 2011 against Melbourne. Adelaide Oval has two notable stands named after significant Port Adelaide individuals, the Fos Williams Stand, and the Gavin Wanganeen Stand. Both were named after the redevelopment of the Eastern Stand at the ground, and are featured alongside other famous individuals from the SANFL and ."

However, the rivalry between the two clubs would first begin in 1882, where Port Adelaide's first win over Norwood was controversially overruled by the league, with a follow-up game overshadowed by a misunderstanding at the gate which almost prevented Norwood players accessing the venue. The clubs met in 14 Grand Finals prior to Port Adelaide's accession into the AFL and share over 60 premierships between them. In 1884, Port Adelaide won the premiership, bringing Norwood's run of six premierships in a row to an end. In 1960, Norwood brought Port Adelaide's own record run of six premierships to an end defeating them by 27 points in the 1960 Preliminary Final. They have met in three Grand Finals following Port Adelaide's entry to the AFL, with Port Adelaide winning in 1999 and Norwood winning in 1997 and 2014.

John Hart Sr. advocated for other settlers to refrain from killing and eating black swans as they were a totem of the Kaurna people. Harry Hewitt was named in Port Adelaide's side when they defeated Fitzroy by two goals on Adelaide Oval in 1891 and is the club's first known Indigenous Australian player. During the 1950s, St Francis House in Glanville housed young indigenous boys, many of whom played for Port Adelaide. Richie Bray became the club's first known Indigenous player to win a premiership, featuring in the 1962, 1963 and 1965 premierships winning teams. Port Adelaide has been represented by 62 indigenous players across the SANFL and AFL competitions throughout its history. Upon the club's entry to the AFL in 1997, the club appointed its first Indigenous captain in Gavin Wanganeen. Wanganeen would later become the first indigenous player in the AFL to play 300 games, and the first indigenous player to join the board of an AFL club.

Riders in each team take turns during the race, handing over to another team member, resting, and then returning to the race. Teams are usually of two riders but occasionally of three. Only one rider of the team is racing at any time, and the replacement rider has to be touched before taking over. The touch can also be a push, often on the shorts, or one rider hurling the other into the race by a hand-sling. How long each rider stays in the race is for the members of each team to decide. Originally, riders took stints of a couple of hours or more and the resting rider went off for a sleep or a meal. That was easier in earlier six-day races because hours could pass without riders attempting to speed away from the others. As races became more intensive, both riders from a team began riding on the track at the same time, one going fast on the short line around the bottom of the track and the other idling higher up until that rider's turn to take over. Modern six-days last less than 12 hours a day and the Madison is now only a featured part, so staying on the track throughout is more feasible. Tied positions are split by points awarded for placings at a series of sprints at intervals during the race. The Madison is a feature of six-day races, but it can also be a separate race, as in the Olympic Games. It has its own championships and specialist riders.

There must be one rider of each team in the race at all times. Riders may relieve each other at any time during the race. Changing shall take place below the stayers line, and as near to the inside edge of the track as practicable. Relieved riders must take up a position outside the stayers line as soon as it is safe and practicable. Changing shall be by one rider drawing level with the other and touching to denote relief. The touch may be a push or handsling. The winners of the race shall be the team which gains the most laps on the other teams. If two or more teams are on the same lap, the result shall be determined by the team which has won the most sprint points during the race. Should there be an equality of laps and points, the winners shall be the best placed team in the final sprint. The race shall end when the leading team has completed the distance. Lapped riders need not fulfil lost laps, and shall be placed as so many laps behind the winners. At pre-determined times during the race there will be sprints for points, with the first four teams over the line gaining 5, 3, 2 and 1 points respectively. A whistle shall be blown to indicate one lap to go before a sprint. A bell will be rung at the start of the last lap. Teams that rejoin the field after gaining or losing laps, shall be eligible for sprint points. Should one member of a team suffer a puncture or mishap, that rider will be allowed to rejoin the race. However, his/her partner should rejoin the race within two laps being covered by the field from the point at which the incident occurred. The Chief Commissaire will pair the rider in the race with another team which is at the same relative position in the race. The rider will ride 'in and out' with the nominated member of the other team until his/her partner rejoins the race. Any team retiring from the race shall inform the Chief Commissaire immediately. Teams may be disciplined by losing points, losing laps or disqualification for misconduct, unfair and/or dangerous riding. The Chief Commissaire may neutralise a race should it be considered necessary to do so . The Chief Commissaire may terminate a race before the full distance should it be considered essential to do so.

        "content": "The Pittsburgh Penguins are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh. They compete in the National Hockey League as a member of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference, and have played their home games at PPG Paints Arena, originally known as Consol Energy Center, since 2010. The team previously played at the Civic Arena, also known as \"the Igloo\". The Penguins are currently affiliated with two minor league teams \u2013 the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL. Founded during the 1967 expansion, the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup five times\u2014in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non-Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, including co-owner Mario Lemieux, who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, Sidney Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise."

        "content": "Early years Before the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 . In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz\u00a0III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February\u00a08, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967\u201368 season. The Penguins paid $2.5\u00a0million for their entry and $750,000 more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena's capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors. A contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown, Ohio. Mark Peters had the winning entry , a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \"Golden Triangle\" of downtown Pittsburgh. The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley, opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario, on September\u00a013, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September\u00a023, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Pens, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate, all-star defenseman Leo Boivin and New York Rangers' veteran Earl Ingarfield, a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald, and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley. George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain. On October\u00a011, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens. On October\u00a021, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4\u20132. However, the Penguins went 27\u201334\u201313 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley, who recorded a 2.88 goals-against average and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti. The next season, 1968\u201369 saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players\u2014including longtime future Pens star Jean Pronovost\u2014making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains. Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL with 44 points , and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito. Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semi-final round, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May\u00a015, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec, suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001. In the 1970\u201371 season, the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21\u201337\u201320 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972, only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost, Syl Apps Jr., Keith McCreary, agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972. The Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974, when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button. Button obtained Steve Durbano, Ab DeMarco, Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28\u201341\u20139 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth. However, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into bankruptcy. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate. Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the 1976\u201377 season. Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair, the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. Playoff runs and a uniform change Beginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of Syl Apps, Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals in 1975, but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season. Baz Bastien, a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in 1977\u201378. Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a second-round sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins. The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January\u00a030, 1980. On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle, and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else. During the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the 1982 playoffs, the Penguins held a 3\u20131 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli. It would be the Pens' final playoff appearance until 1989. Lemieux\u2013Jagr era The team had the league's worst record in both the 1983 and 1984 seasons. With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate. Mario Lemieux, one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the New Jersey Devils, who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management. Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted. Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens, Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Pens; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. The 1985\u201386 Pens missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In 1986\u201387, they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In 1987\u201388, for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game. In 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December\u00a031, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game . The Pens shocked the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game. Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles A herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989\u201390 season, although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings and trades played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent. The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games, punctuated by an 8\u20130 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush, the first NHL team ever to visit the White House. The following season, the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer, and Scotty Bowman took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 1991\u201392. Cancer revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was tragically diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56\u201321\u20137 record, the franchise's best regular-season ever, winning the Presidents' Trophy. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it ever had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of this success, the New York Islanders eliminated them in the second round of Game 7 in overtime. The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: Alexei Kovalev, Martin Straka, Aleksey Morozov, Robert Lang and Petr Nedved, and defensemen Sergei Zubov, Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 , the second round in 1995 and the conference finals in 1996 . The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games. Lemieux's retirement and return On April\u00a06, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin. The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4\u20131 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20132 in the second round. By this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998. Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5\u00a0million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity\u2014enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux assumed control on September\u00a03, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time. Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December\u00a08, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December\u00a027, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player\u2013owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs, highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils. Rebuilding The Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998\u201399, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year. Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in 2002, finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The following season they finished second-last. In the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, the Penguins selected goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury with the first overall pick. The 2003\u201304 season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular-season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 , with just one sellout. As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL Entry Draft , which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center Evgeni Malkin, was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation delayed his Pittsburgh debut. By this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling and/or relocating the team to Kansas City, Missouri. A lockout prompted the cancellation of the 2004\u201305 NHL season. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators, which had filed for bankruptcy protection. During the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and to European leagues. Crosby\u2013Malkin era With the lockout resolved in 2005, the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the 2005 NHL Entry Draft selection order. The draft lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a \"secure location\", resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick. Quebec Major Junior Hockey League superstar Sidney Crosby was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July\u00a030, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh. The Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 per game on average in the 2005\u201306 season. However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien. Then, on January\u00a024, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement,  after developing an irregular heartbeat, this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer , eighth in goals and tenth in assists , and with the second-highest career points per game average , which is second to Wayne Gretzky's 1.92. Despite the team's struggles, Crosby established himself as a star in the league, amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history . The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, and selected touted two-way forward Jordan Staal. The team announced on April\u00a020 they would not renew the contract for general manager Craig Patrick, who had been the general manager since December 1989. On May\u00a025, Ray Shero signed a five-year contract as general manager. Runner\u2013up and third Stanley Cup title Change came for the Penguins on October\u00a018, 2006, when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games. The Penguins finished the 2006\u201307 season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47\u201324\u201311, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the 2007 playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4\u20131. At the season's end, rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won. On March\u00a013, 2007, Pennsylvania's Governor Ed Rendell, Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the Consol Energy Center, guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June\u00a08, 2007, a $325\u00a0million bond was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year lease on September\u00a019, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040. After a mediocre start to the 2007\u201308 season, Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April\u00a02, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title\u2014their first division title in 10 years\u2014with a 4\u20132 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4\u20130, defeating the New York Rangers 4\u20131 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20131 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy. Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14\u20136 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points , tying Conn Smythe Trophy-winner Henrik Zetterberg for the playoff scoring lead. In the 2008\u201309 season, Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, like the previous years, the Penguins won Games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in Games 5 and 6. In Game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2\u20131 to win their third Stanley Cup title. Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs. New arena and injuries During the 2009\u201310 season, Crosby scored 109 points in 81 games, winning the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive Game 7, which the Penguins lost 5\u20132, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena. In 2010\u201311, the Penguins played their first game in the Consol Energy Center. On February\u00a011, 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins\u2013New York Islanders brawl took place. A season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to Tampa Bay Lightning, with Fleury's goaltending called into question. With Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome, at the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games. Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award. Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft for the upcoming 2012\u201313 season. During the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the Conference Finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June\u00a013, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5\u00a0million. In the 2013\u201314 season, the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division, though the club struggled in the playoffs, requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets, then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3\u20131 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June\u00a06 with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June\u00a025, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014\u201315 season, the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps, the team fell to fourth in the Division. The Pens lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger Phil Kessel. Back-to-back Stanley Cups and 50th anniversary After acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015\u201316 season. However, by December\u00a012, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15\u201310\u20133 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan, who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the playoffs, the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4\u20131 series, the Capitals 4\u20132 and the Lightning 4\u20133 to win the Eastern Conference Championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals against the San Jose Sharks. On June\u00a012, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4\u20132 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. The Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October\u00a013, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington. The Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the 2017 playoffs, defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the Conference Finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced the Nashville Predators. The Penguins won the first two games of the finals and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997\u201398 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title successfully and the first to do so in the salary cap era. Contenders Before the 2017\u201318 season, the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft to the Vegas Golden Knights. Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games. In the next season, the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the First Round. In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs, but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the Qualifying Round. On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. Brian Burke was hired as president of hockey operations. On February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach 1,000 NHL games for the team. The Penguins won the East Division title, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons. This became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the San Antonio Spurs missing the 2020 NBA playoffs. The 2020\u201321 season came to an end in Game 6 of the first round of the playoffs against the New York Islanders. On November 29, 2021, Fenway Sports Group announced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins. On December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins."

        "content": "Despite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald, noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins. However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field. Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level."

        "title": "Pittsburgh Penguins_Crest and sweater design",
        "content": "When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed. The team's colors were originally powder blue, navy blue, and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city. The Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983\u201384 season. In the 1992\u201393 season, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo. The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the \"skating penguin\" logo, but with a \"Vegas gold\" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the \"skating penguin\" was readopted as the primary, though the \"flying penguin\" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995\u20132002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007\u201308 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders. The Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the 2003\u201304 NHL season. The team wore their powder blue, 1968\u20131972 \"throwbacks\" against the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 NHL Winter Classic. This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. For the 2011\u201312 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired. Called the \"Blue Jerseys of Doom\" by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms. In 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured \"Pittsburgh gold\", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002. The Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black \"Pittsburgh gold\" alternates, thus retiring the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016\u201317 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary. During the 2017 NHL Stadium Series against the archrival Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a \"City of Champions\" patch and a variation of the \"skating penguin\" logo. This design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018\u201319 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms. The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the 2019 NHL Stadium Series. In 2021, the Penguins wore white \"Reverse Retro\" uniforms based on the 1992\u201397 uniforms. This set replaced the \"flying penguin\" with the alternate \"skating penguin\" logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders. A black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 2021\u201322 season."

He remained the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968\u201369 season. Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969\u201370 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970\u201371 season, with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970\u201371 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a color commentator to the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position in the booth. Mike Lange, who joined the Penguins' broadcast team as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974\u201375 became the play-by-play broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979\u201380 season. At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover in 1972\u201373. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984\u201385, when Schiffauer was replaced by Paul Steigerwald. Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999. With Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman Peter Taglianetti. Taglianetti remained in the position for one season before being replaced by Eddie Olczyk. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins' history following the firing of previous head coach Rick Kehoe after the 2002\u201303 season. With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired Bob Errey as their new color commentator for the start of the 2003\u201304 season. Lange and Errey remained in the booth until 2005\u201306. After 26 seasons in the television broadcast booth, FSN Pittsburgh did not retain Mike Lange. Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the team's TV play-by-play broadcaster until the 2016\u201317 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and currently holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016\u201317 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and NHL Network personality Steve Mears was hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017\u201318 season. Lange retired in the 2021 offseason, with Josh Getzoff being named as his replacement. Currently, Phil Bourque serves as the radio color commentator. Every Penguins game is currently carried on the AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others. In addition, Fox Sports Ohio simulcasts Penguins hockey in the Cleveland metro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and Direct TV each carry the Penguins games on their AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The Pittsburgh Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly \"game of the week\" national exposure on American networks ESPN, ESPN+, ABC, and TNT, and Canadian networks Sportsnet and CBC.

From 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home, and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training. In August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228. The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play. As with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and the Consol Energy Center."

The team compete in , the fourth tier of the English football league system. Founded in 1884 as Belmont Football Club, they adopted their current name in 1885. Tranmere's regular kit is an all-white strip with blue, or occasionally blue and green trim, their main colours since 1962. The club moved to its current home, Prenton Park, in 1912. In 1995, the ground had a major redevelopment in response to the Taylor Report. It now seats 16,567 in four stands: the Main Stand, the Kop, the Johnny King Stand and the Cowshed. Tranmere played in regional leagues until they were invited to become a founder member of Football League Third Division North in 1921. They finished as champions for the 1937\u201338 season, though were relegated out of the Second Division the following year. They dropped into the Fourth Division in 1961, before winning promotion back to the third tier at the end of the 1966\u201367 season. Relegation in 1975 was followed by an immediate promotion in 1975\u201376 under the stewardship of manager John King, and this time they survived for just three seasons in the third tier until being relegated once again in 1979. During the 1980s, they were beset by financial problems and, in 1987, went into administration. However John King returned to manage the club for a second spell and guided Rovers to promotion in 1988\u201389, which they followed up by winning the Associate Members' Cup in 1990 and then promotion out of the play-offs in 1991. The 1990s would prove to be the most successful period in the club's history as Tranmere remained in the second tier, and came close to reaching the Premier League with three consecutive play-off campaigns at the start of the decade. Under King's successor, John Aldridge, Tranmere experienced a number of cup runs, most notably reaching the 2000 League Cup final. They were finally relegated in 2001 and then spent 13 seasons in the third tier, before two successive relegations saw them drop out of the Football League after an 84-year stay. Tranmere spent three seasons in the National League and then returned to the third tier of the Football League via successive play-off campaigns in 2018 and 2019. They were relegated from League One in 2020 after clubs voted to end the season early due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

On 15 November 1884, they won their first game 4\u20130 against Brunswick Rovers. This was a friendly match, as there were no leagues until 1888. Under the presidency of James McGaul, the team had a successful inaugural season, losing only one of their fifteen matches. An unrelated, disbanded side had played under the name \"Tranmere Rovers Cricket Club \" in 1881\u201382. On 16 September 1885, before their second season began, Belmont F.C. adopted this name Tranmere Rovers.  Tranmere is historically a large village that was subsumed within the later expansion of the town of Birkenhead. Tranmere played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead. In 1887, they bought Ravenshaws Field from Tranmere Rugby Club. In 1895, their ground was renamed Prenton Park, although it was 25 years later that the team moved into the current stadium of the same name. Tranmere first wore a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. In 1889 they adopted orange and maroon shirts, but in 1904 returned to wearing their original kit. In 1886, Tranmere entered their first competition: the Liverpool and District Challenge Cup; in 1889, they entered the West Lancashire League. They joined the Combination, a much stronger league, in 1897, and won the championship in 1908. In 1910, continuing their movement through the leagues, they entered the Lancashire Combination and in 1912 they showed their ambition by moving to the present Prenton Park site, with an 800-seat stand. Tranmere won the Lancashire Combination Championship in 1914 and Stan Rowlands became the first Tranmere player to receive an international cap when he was selected to play for Wales. Rovers continued to play throughout the First World War, although their players were criticised for avoiding military service, despite being employed in the local shipyards."

Their timing was excellent as the following season, four Central League clubs\u00a0\u2013 including Tranmere\u00a0\u2013 were invited to join the new Division Three North. On 27 August 1921, as founder members of the division, they won their first Football League match 4\u20131 against Crewe Alexandra at Prenton Park. At this time the team were managed by Bert Cooke, who did so for 23 years in total, the club record for longest serving manager. In 1924, local youngster Dixie Dean made his debut aged 16 years 355 days. He played 30 games for Rovers, scoring 27 goals, before being transferred to Everton for \u00a33,000. In the 1927\u201328 season, Dean scored a record 60 League goals for Everton. After Dean's departure, a string of talented youngsters also left for Division One clubs, leading to Cooke's reputation as a shrewd businessman. Among those sold was Pongo Waring who\u00a0\u2013 having scored six goals in the 11\u20131 victory over Durham City\u00a0\u2013 went to Aston Villa for \u00a34,700. Waring retains the record of scoring most goals for Villa in a single season. In 1934, an FA Cup tie between Rovers and Liverpool was watched at Anfield by 61,036 fans, then a record crowd for a game involving Rovers. One year later, Bunny Bell netted 57 goals during the 1933\u201334 season, and nine goals in the 13\u20134 Boxing Day 1935 victory over Oldham Athletic. As of 2011, the aggregate of 17 goals in one game remains a league record. During this same period, Tranmere made several appearances in the Welsh Cup, reaching the Final on two occasions.  In 1934, they lost 3\u20130 to Bristol City in a replay, after a 1\u20131 draw.  The following season, they went one better by beating local rivals Chester 1\u20130 to win their first silverware since joining the Football League. Rovers won their first championship in the Football League in 1938 with victory in Division Three North and, hence, promotion to Division Two for the first time. It is still Rovers' only championship in the Football League. However, they were relegated the next season winning six matches\u00a0\u2013 the record for the worst performance of any team in Division Two."

        "content": "Prenton Park emerged from the Second World War largely unscathed. Tranmere rejoined the peacetime Football League in Division Three North and stayed there until the 1958 restructuring of the football league's lower divisions. Manager Peter Farrell led Tranmere to finish 11th in the final season of the Northern Section, securing a place in the new national Division Three where they were, again, founder members. The final match against Wrexham, also fighting for a place in the higher league, attracted a crowd of 19,615, which remains the highest ever attendance at a Prenton Park league match. In 1961, Tranmere's inspirational captain Harold Bell left the club. Bell had been picked in the first game after the Second World War in the 1946 season and did not miss a match until he was dropped on 30 August 1955, a total of 459 consecutive appearances for a British team, a record which held until 2011. Rovers certainly missed their captain, and were relegated to Division Four for the first time in 1961. The club brought in Dave Russell as manager who made some revolutionary changes. Tranmere had worn a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks since 1904\u00a0\u2013 the same colours as local rivals, Division One club Everton. Russell introduced an all-white strip to set the teams apart; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. Russell also developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened, and Rovers reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time. Three years later the club's record attendance at Prenton Park was established as 24,424 supporters witnessed Rovers draw 2\u20132 with Stoke City in the FA Cup. In 1972, Ron Yeats was installed as player/manager. He strengthened Tranmere's connections with local rivals Liverpool by recruiting several former teammates such as Ian St John, and bringing in Bill Shankly in a consultancy role. This team saw one of the most memorable Rovers results of all time when, in a League Cup tie in 1973, Tranmere beat First Division Arsenal 1\u20130 at their former Highbury home. However, Tranmere returned to the Fourth Division in 1975. The following decade was among the bleakest times in the club's history, with the team usually in the lower reaches of the Fourth Division, beset by financial problems, and attaining crowds of less than 2,000. In 1979, Steve Mungall joined Tranmere from Motherwell. He went on to make more than 500 league appearances for Rovers in a 17-year period. This spell saw Rovers rise up the league and make several appearances at Wembley. He remained with the club on the coaching staff before leaving in October 2000 to pursue business interests."

        "content": "Another relegation to Division Four in 1979 put the club in financial difficulties. Debts mounted throughout the 1980s, with insolvency forestalled through a series of friendly fixtures, contributions from fans and a \u00a3200,000 loan from Wirral Council. This partnership proved an enduring one, as Wirral's logo still appeared on the shirts until 2011. In July 1984 the club was sold to a Californian attorney, making Tranmere one of the first English clubs bought by a foreign owner. Nonetheless, in 1987 the club went into administration, with local businessman Peter Johnson taking over control and ownership. This proved to be a turning point in Tranmere's history, the club under his ownership enjoying by far the most successful period in its history, in which manager John King took the team from the bottom of Division Four to the brink of English football's top league. King's first task was to avoid the team finishing bottom of Division Four, which would have resulted in their relegation from the football league. Safety was guaranteed on the last game of the season with a 1\u20130 home win over Exeter City. The first full season of King's second managerial spell in charge saw Tranmere make their first appearance at Wembley stadium when a good mid-season run of form saw them qualify for the Football League Centenary Tournament. Tranmere were the surprise stars of the event, beating Division One Wimbledon and Newcastle United before losing on penalties to eventual winners Nottingham Forest. The following season, King guided Tranmere to promotion as Division Four runners-up. Their final game played to clinch promotion was against Crewe Alexandra, and was notable for the fact that both teams needed a point to gain promotion. The first half was contested as usual, but the second half, with the score at 1\u20131, both teams failed to attack each other's goals, leading to combined celebrations at the final whistle. In the same season, they achieved a string of cup successes including beating Division One Middlesbrough. Promotion was almost achieved in their first season in Division Three, losing 2\u20130 in the Play-off Final to Notts County., a week after Tranmere's 2\u20131 victory over Bristol Rovers at Wembley in the final of the Leyland DAF Trophy had clinched the club's first trophy. A key element in Tranmere's success during this period was the form of striker Ian Muir. He joined the club in 1985 and scored 180 goals in eleven seasons. He is the club's record scorer, and the first inductee to their hall of fame. Fellow hall of fame member John Morrissey joined the club in 1986. The winger spent 14 seasons at the club, making 585 appearances."

Once again, Rovers made an appearance in the Leyland DAF Trophy final, this time losing 3\u20132 to Birmingham City. This made the play-off victory over Bolton Tranmere's fourth appearance in a Wembley final in just over a year. Former Liverpool player John Aldridge joined the club in summer of 1991, signing from Spain's Real Sociedad for \u00a3250,000; he would remain on the club's payroll for the next 10 years, scoring 170 times to put him behind only Ian Muir in the all-time scoring charts. Aldridge also received 30 caps for the Republic of Ireland, and was the first Tranmere player to score at a World Cup. In 1993, Scotland international Pat Nevin joined the team, forming a four-man attack alongside Aldridge, Malkin and Morrissey. Tranmere reached the play-offs in three successive seasons missing out on promotion to the newly formed Premier League through defeat to Swindon Town in 1993, Leicester City in 1994, and Reading in 1995. 1994 also saw Tranmere progress to the League Cup semi-final, where they faced Aston Villa over two legs. The home leg was won 3\u20131 by Tranmere, with Villa scoring their only goal in the 94th minute. The away leg was 2\u20131 to Villa until the 88th minute with Villa finally winning 3\u20131, so the match went to extra time and penalties. Tranmere were one kick away from the final but Liam O'Brien's sudden death penalty was saved by Mark Bosnich and they eventually lost 5\u20134. A reconstructed Prenton Park was opened in March 1995, with the all seater stadium now holding just under 17,000 supporters. One year later, John Aldridge was appointed player/manager and held that position for five years; he retired from playing in 1999."

        "content": "In the 1999\u20132000 season, despite severe financial constraints, victories over a succession of Premiership sides led not only to a place in the sixth round of the FA Cup but a place in the 2000 Football League Cup Final against Leicester City\u00a0\u2013 the first time Rovers had ever reached a major final. Matt Elliott scored Leicester's opening goal, before Tranmere's Clint Hill was sent off for a second bookable offence. Despite being reduced to ten men, David Kelly equalised; but Elliot soon netted Leicester's second goal and Tranmere lost the match 2\u20131. It was the last League Cup game to be played at the original Wembley stadium. In 2000, the all-white kit was reintroduced and is still used in 2014. That season they enjoyed yet another run in Cup competitions beating local Premier League rivals Everton 3\u20130 at Goodison Park, then Southampton 4\u20133 , before finally bowing out to Liverpool. They nevertheless struggled in League matches; Aldridge quit before Tranmere's relegation to Division Two ended a spell of ten years in Division One. Brian Little was appointed as manager in 2003. He took Rovers to a play-off semi final in 2004\u201305 and a best ever 6th round replay in the 2004 FA Cup where they lost to eventual finalists, Millwall. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Little left the club and was replaced by former player Ronnie Moore. In Moore's three seasons in charge, the club finished 9th, 11th and 7th, just missing out the play-offs in the final season. Despite this, he was sacked in 2009 and replaced by former England winger John Barnes, whose only previous domestic managerial experience was with Celtic 10 years earlier. It was whilst Barnes was manager that long serving Kitman, Mark Trevor, ended his 12-year 'Labour of Love' washing the kit of his local team. Having been at the club since 1997, he washed his last kit in August 2009 ready for the home game with Charlton Athletic. Barnes' reign lasted considerably less, it was a mere five months before long-serving club physiotherapist Les Parry was given temporary charge. Rovers finished the season in 19th place in League One, avoiding relegation on the final day of the season thanks to a 3\u20130 victory at Stockport County. In June 2010, Parry was given the manager's job on a permanent basis.  He was sacked on 4 March 2012, after a 1\u20130 defeat by Chesterfield left them only one point above the relegation zone, and replaced by Ronnie Moore for the remainder of the season. Moore won six of his thirteen games in charge at the end of the season, guiding Tranmere to a comfortable mid-table position, as they finished the season in the top half for the first time in several years. Moore then signed a new one-year deal with Tranmere, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Towards the end of the 2013\u201314 season, Moore admitted breaking the Football Association's betting rules, and was sacked by Tranmere when the club were just outside the relegation zone. Assistant John McMahon took over as caretaker manager, but Tranmere were relegated to League Two on the final game of the season. Rob Edwards was subsequently appointed as new manager. On 11 August 2014, it was announced that former player and Football Association chief executive Mark Palios and his wife Nicola were taking a controlling interest in the club from outgoing chairman Peter Johnson.  Mark Palios would become Executive Chairman of the club, with Johnson becoming Honorary President. After a poor start to the season, the home loss to Plymouth Argyle on 11 October 2014 saw Tranmere in last place in the Football League for the first time since 27 August 1987 after they had lost their first two matches of that season. Edwards was sacked as manager on 13 October. Mickey Adams took over a week later, with the aim of saving the club from relegation to the Conference. However, on 25 April 2015 Tranmere were relegated from the Football League after another defeat to Plymouth Argyle in the reverse fixture, ending their 94-year stay in the leagues."

        "content": "Gary Brabin was appointed as manager on 5 May 2015. It was a season of ups and downs, with home form suffering while away form was much more successful. It took a while for Rovers to adjust to life in the non-league, with erratic form during the season. Tranmere finished sixth, one place outside the play-off zone, in Gary Brabin's first season. Tranmere started the 2016\u201317 season brightly, ranking at the top of the table at the end of August, gaining Gary Brabin the manager of the month. Form later dipped which resulted in one goal scored in the next four games, with the 1\u20130 defeat to Sutton United on BT Sport resulting in Brabin being sacked on 18 September 2016.  Assistant manager, ex-Southport boss Paul Carden took the reins on an interim basis. On 6 October 2016, former Tranmere player Micky Mellon was appointed permanent manager. His first game in charge was against cross-border rivals Wrexham AFC, and a 2\u20130 victory for Tranmere. Despite a 2nd-place finish and a club record 95 point haul, this still was not enough to gain automatic promotion back to the league. Tranmere faced Aldershot Town in the playoffs. A goal from James Norwood and a brace from Cole Stockton in the first leg away at the Recreation Ground saw Rovers take a 3\u20130 lead back to Prenton Park for the second leg, which ended in a 2\u20132 draw, Norwood and Stockton once again on the scoresheet. This gave Tranmere a 5\u20132 aggregate win and their first Wembley appearance in 17 years. On 14 May 2017, Tranmere suffered a 3\u20131 defeat in the National League play-off final at the hands of Forest Green, Connor Jennings with Rovers first goal at Wembley since the 2000 League Cup Final. Tranmere's 2017\u201318 season got off to a poor start, with 3 wins from the first 12 games. Tranmere slipped to 18th in the league, their lowest ever league position. A spectacular winter turnaround saw Tranmere move into the play-offs, where they would find themselves for the remainder of the season. This turnaround included a record breaking run of 9 consecutive home league wins. This record breaking stint was ended in February by a 4\u20131 defeat at the hands of eventual title winners Macclesfield Town. Tranmere responded to this defeat by winning 8 out of their next 9 games, finishing the season as National League runners up for the second time in as many years. A new play-off system was in place for the 2017\u201318 season, which meant that Tranmere faced a one-legged play-off home semi-final against either 5th or 6th place. It was 6th place Ebbsfleet United that found themselves travelling up to Prenton Park after beating Aldershot Town on penalties. In the semi-final, Tranmere came from behind twice to take the game to extra time, the full-time score being 2\u20132, James Norwood with the first goal and Burnley loannee Josh Ginnelly with the second. An extra time free kick from James Norwood, followed by a goal from Larnell Cole saw Tranmere run out 4\u20132 victors after extra time, sending Tranmere to Wembley for the National League play-off final. Boreham Wood stood between Tranmere and a return to the Football League. On 12 May 2018, a crowd of 16,306 were at Wembley for the final. Tranmere were 2\u20131 victors, their first trophy in 27 years, and were promoted back to the Football League."

On 25 May 2019, Tranmere secured back-to-back promotions, beating Newport County 1\u20130 at Wembley, with a goal from Connor Jennings in the 119th minute, thus securing their spot in League One for the 2019\u201320 season. By March 2020, the team were within the relegation zone, but with a game in hand on their nearest rivals and on a run of three successive victories.  The cancellation of fixtures due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the season could not be completed, and a vote was taken by League One clubs on 9 June to resolve promotion and relegation issues on a points per game basis.  This meant that Tranmere would be demoted to League Two for the 2020/21 season.  Club chairman Mark Palios said that the decision was unfair and that he was considering legal action as a result.  He also announced that 20 members of staff would have to be made redundant. With the team back in League Two, Mike Jackson was named as manager of Tranmere on 18 July 2020.  He was sacked on 31 October 2020.   Keith Hill succeeded temporary manager Ian Dawes on 21 November 2020.

        "content": "Belmont F.C., the forerunners of today's Rovers, wore blue shirts and white shorts, as did the early Rovers, until a radical change in 1889, when a combination of maroon and orange shirts and navy blue shorts was introduced to \"dazzle\" their opponents in the West Lancashire League. These were abandoned in 1904 in favour of the earlier blue and white colours which have, in some form or other, remained until the present day. In 1962, Dave Russell introduced a white strip with blue trim, saying \"Tranmere Rovers should have a specific identity of its own, so on Merseyside there's now Liverpool's Red, Everton's blue and Tranmere's white\". Since then, the team have worn varying combinations of blue and white, moving back towards a more predominantly white kit in 2000. The team's colours are reflected in their nickname of the \"Superwhites\". Tranmere first introduced a badge on their shirt in 1962, wearing the coat of arms of the borough of Birkenhead, along with adopting their motto \"Ubi fides ibi lux et robur\", meaning \"Where there is faith there is light and strength\". The crest was replaced in 1972 by a monogram, and in 1981 by a simplified blue and white shield. In 1987, a complicated and confusing crest was introduced, adapting the Birkenhead crest through the inclusion of a football and a TRFC logo. The simpler badge was adopted in 1997, and modified slightly in 2009 to mark the club's 125-year anniversary.  The blue and white crest incorporated simplified elements of the Birkenhead civic coat of arms: the crosier and lion originally formed part of the Birkenhead Priory seal; the oak tree was a symbol of the Tranmere Local Board; the star or starfish represents Bebington; the two lions represent Oxton; and the crescents may represent the Laird family. For the 2021\u201322 season, Tranmere reverted back to their pre-1997 badge."

The ground was variously referred to as the \"Borough Road Enclosure\", \"Ravenshaw's Field\" and \"South Road\". The name \"Prenton Park\" was adopted in 1895 as a result of a suggestion in the letters page of the Football Echo. Because the land was required for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced to move and the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened on 9 March 1912. There were stands on both sides of the pitch, a paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994. Many improvements to the ground were driven by changes in legislation. The biggest change of all took place during 1994 and 1995. The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football should no longer permit standing. The club's response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all-seater stands created\u00a0\u2013 the Borough Road Stand , the Cowshed and the new Kop, in addition to the existing Main Stand. Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14,200 to the 16,567 of today. On 11 March 1995, the new ground was officially opened at a cost of \u00a33.1 million. Attendances at the ground have fluctuated over its hundred-year history. Around 8,000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium, as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8\u20130. Prenton Park's largest-ever crowd was 24,424 for a 1972 FA Cup match between Tranmere and Stoke City. In 2010, an average of 5,000 fans attended each home game."

He oversaw the club's entry into the Football League and remained in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. Major changes were not seen until businessman Dave Russell took over in 1961. His introductions included the team's current all-white kit and regularly arranged floodlit home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. Rock band and Tranmere fans Half Man Half Biscuit described the practice in their song \"Friday Night And The Gates Are Low\". Tranmere's most successful period came at the end of the twentieth century. John King returned for his third spell at the club in 1987, having previously both played and managed the team. He led them to a victory in the League Trophy, and from the bottom of the Fourth Division to reach the play-offs for promotion to the Premier League on three occasions. Success continued under King's replacement, John Aldridge, including an appearance in the 2000 Football League Cup Final. From 2009, they were managed by former club physiotherapist, Les Parry, until he was sacked on 4 March 2012, and replaced by Ronnie Moore.  In February 2014 it was reported that Moore was under investigation by The Football Association, for breaching its rules against betting on competitions in which his club were involved.  Three days later, he was suspended, and after admitting the FA's charges he was sacked on 9 April 2014. On 27 May 2014, the club announced that Rob Edwards had been appointed as their new manager. He was sacked on 13 October 2014. Moving quickly to arrest the decline which had seen Tranmere slump to the bottom of League Two, former Port Vale manager Micky Adams' appointment was announced on 16 October 2014. He left the club by mutual consent on 19 April 2015, when the club were bottom of the league with two matches remaining. He was replaced by Gary Brabin, whose contract was in turn ended in September 2016. Micky Mellon was appointed manager the following month, going on to lead the team to two consecutive play-off final victories  in the 2017\u201318 and 2018-19 seasons and a return to League One.

        "content": "In many team sports which involve scoring goals, the goalkeeper is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring by blocking or intercepting opposing shots on goal. Such positions exist in bandy, rink bandy, camogie, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, floorball, handball, hurling, field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, lacrosse, ringette, rinkball, water polo, and shinty as well as in other sports. In most sports which involve scoring in a net, special rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players. These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper . This is most apparent in sports such as ice hockey and lacrosse, where goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object In some sports, goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players; in association football, for example, the keeper is allowed to kick the ball just as any other player, but may also use their hands to handle the ball in a restricted area. In other sports, goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take or the area of the field or rink where they may be; in the NHL, for example, goalkeepers may not play the puck in the restricted areas behind the net or take the puck across the red line."

        "content": "In football, each team's goalkeeper defends their team's goal and has special privileges within the game. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop any penetration of the ball into the goal. The goalkeeper is the only player in the side who may use his or her hands and arms to catch, throw and save the ball, but only within their own penalty area. Goalkeepers are required to wear a distinctive colour jersey, separate from the referee's jersey colour and either team's regular jersey colour, so the referee can easily identify them. There are no other specific requirements, but goalkeepers are usually allowed to wear additional protective gear such as padded clothing. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves to protect their hands and enhance their grip of the ball. Like every player on the pitch, they are required to wear shin guards. The goalkeeper is allowed to catch the ball, and is also allowed to punch or deflect the ball away from the goal. The goalkeeper generally has a significant advantage on a ball high in the air by raising their arms and play the ball before an attacker can attempt a header. When the keeper picks up the ball, they are allowed to kick it or throw it, or to place it on the ground and play it with the feet. The official Laws of the Game stipulate that once the goalkeeper must redistribute the ball within six seconds after picking up the ball; however, referees often use their discretion as long as the goalkeeper is not obviously attempting to waste time. Once the keeper establishes possession of the ball, opposing players are not allowed to attempt to play the ball and must give the goalkeeper room to attempt a kick. Referees usually give advantage to the an unprotected goalkeeper if a ball is in the air and both the goalkeeper and a field player of the opposing team are challenging for the ball. The death of Sunderland A.F.C. goalkeeper Jimmy Thorpe shaped the development of the rule by which players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper with control of the ball in their arms. Despite winning the league that season, Sunderland's season was marked with tragedy after the young goalkeeper died as a result of a kick in the head and chest after he had picked up the ball following a backpass in a game against Chelsea at Roker Park. He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home afterwards and died in hospital four days later from diabetes mellitus and heart failure 'accelerated by the rough usage of the opposing team'. Though the goalkeeper is generally allowed to use their hands in the penalty box area, they are not allowed to use their hands on balls that have been intentionally kicked to them by a teammate . In such situations, the goalkeeper may play the ball with their feet, but cannot pick the ball up. The rule applies only to a ball which is kicked. A ball which is headed or otherwise not kicked may be picked up by the goalkeeper without penalty. An infringement of this rule results in an indirect kick to the opposing team. The referee has some discretion in making this call. For example, a ball which is merely deflected by a teammate may still be picked up by the goalkeeper. The \"back-pass\" rule has been followed in international football and in most professional and amateur leagues since the early 1990s, but leagues for younger players may choose not to enforce the rule. The back pass rule is listed in Law 12 of the Laws of the Game. As the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as the organizer of the team when it is defending, such as on a free kick or a corner kick. This means the goalkeeper needs to be loud, with a voice that can project over the defensive area of the pitch. In turn, the players on their team need to be able to listen and respond to directions called to them."

He is allowed to hold the ball for six seconds before he has to release it. He may drop it to a defender or chuck it directly into attack. If the ball passes the goal line, it is followed by different actions: If the ball is last touched by a defender, the reaction is an own goal if the ball goes between the goalposts. If it passes outside the goalposts, the reaction is a corner stroke. If last touched by an attacker's stick, and passes between the posts, the reaction is a goal, or a disallowed goal . If the ball passes from an attacker over the goal line outside the goalposts, the goalkeeper may retrieve a new ball from a cage hanging on the goal's either side, and put the new ball in play with no signal from the referees. The goalkeeper is the only player who may use his or her hands to play the ball . According to Rule 6.1 the goalkeeper is required to wear a jersey with a different color from either team's jersey color to avoid confusion for the referee. Goalkeepers wear padded gloves to aid in catching the ball, large shinpads, a padded sweater, and a helmet with a face mask. He is the only player in the team who can pass the ball to a teammate by aid of his skates. The team might have a reserve goalkeeper, and the two may switch at any time during the game, without the need to notify the referee. There is no time-out in bandy, but an exception is sometimes made when the goalkeeper is hurt, especially if they don't have a designated reserve keeper. As the goalkeeper is usually the team's only player who can see the entire field, they often act as an organizer of the team when it is defending, especially for free strokes against them."

        "content": "In field hockey, the goalkeeper generally wears extensive protective equipment including helmet, face and neck guards, chest and leg padding, arm or elbow protectors, special gloves , lower leg guards and shoe covers . The gloves, pads and kickers are almost always made of special high density foam material that both protects the goalkeeper and has excellent rebound qualities.  The goalkeeper is also equipped with a stick; either one designed for goalies or one as used for normal play. Specialist goalkeeper sticks must conform to the same dimensional limitations as field players' sticks but are designed for optimal use with one hand and for blocking rather than hitting the ball. From 2007 teams may elect to play with 11 field players, and no-one has the privileges of a goalkeeper. If a goalkeeper is used, they fall into one of two categories: a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, unless they are nominated to take a penalty stroke against the opposing goalkeeper, wear a different colored shirt and at least foot and leg guards ; or they may opt to wear only a helmet. The goalkeeper is allowed to use any part of their body to play or deflect the ball, although they can't obstruct its play , and they can only do so within the goal circle . Outside the D they are subject to the same rules as field players and may only use their stick to play the ball. Goalkeepers who are wearing a helmet are not permitted to pass their team's 23 m line, with the exception of goalkeepers who take penalty strokes. However a goalkeeper who has elected to wear only a helmet is permitted to remove it and provided it is not left on the field of play, they may take part in the game in any part of the pitch, and retain their goalkeeping privileges, even if they do not have time to replace the helmet before making a save. It is compulsory to wear a helmet when defending a penalty stroke or penalty corner."

Goalkeepers do not have sticks, and they move in the goal crease on their knees, attempting to save the shots on goal. When the goalkeeper has possession of the ball, he has 3 seconds to throw it back into the game. He may not control the ball outside of his crease, except when kicking it. Goalkeepers are an essential part of starting plays, as they can throw the ball for a quick offensive chance. When throwing, the ball has to touch the goalkeeper's own side first before crossing the center line. Goalkeepers are also important in organizing their team's games, as they see the whole field better. Any contact against the goalkeeper will result in a free shot or a 2-minute penalty. Like in ice hockey, the goalkeeper may be substituted for an extra attacker, if a delayed penalty occurs, or if his team needs a goal to tie the game in the final moments of the game. Goalkeepers may score goals, although this is not the case in some leagues. In floorball games, more goals are often scored than in, for example, ice hockey, because of the extremely quick tempo of the game and fast shots. The only mandatory equipment for goalkeepers are masks, goalie-shirts, goalie-pants and shoes. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves. They may also optionally wear other protective equipment, such as knee pads, elbow-guards, shin-guards, jocks and torso armor. In some junior/independent leagues, many goalkeepers don't even wear goalie-shirts, but hooded tops."

Eventually the term became obsolete and was replaced by the term defensive fullback, then to its modern term free safety . Unlike in soccer or Gaelic football, the goal-tend/safety does not physically protect the goalposts, as they are elevated above the ground and mostly out of the reach of any player . Also unlike other codes of football, goal-tends have no special ball-handling privileges. One situation in which a goalkeeper-like responsibility can arise is in Canadian football, where a single point is awarded for a kicked ball that is not returned out of the end zone. While standard practice is for defending teams to concede the single point, situations often arise where conceding that point could jeopardize a lead. A goal-tend can thus be employed to recover the ball and either return it out of the end zone or, generally if it is in the closing seconds of a game, punt the ball back into play or out of bounds to ensure the point is not conceded."

This is significantly larger than field players' heads to assist in blocking shots. Once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in his crosse , he may only remain in possession of the ball inside the protective crease for four seconds . Before the four seconds is up, the goalkeeper must either pass the ball or leave the crease. After leaving, he may not re-enter the crease with possession of the ball. While inside the crease , offensive players may not make contact with the goalie or his stick. Doing so is declared \"goalie interference\" and is penalized by a free clear to the half field line. In addition, a goalie is allowed to make contact with the ball with his hand, although he is not allowed to control it or pick it up. In women's lacrosse,  once a goalkeeper makes a save and has control of the ball in her crosse, she may remain in possession of the ball inside the crease for ten seconds. The interference rule is similar to men's lacrosse; unlike in the men's game, a woman goalkeeper is allowed to control or even pick up the ball in her hand. In both men's and women's lacrosse, goalkeepers are required to wear a helmet and 4-point chinstrap, a throat protector, gloves, and a chest protector. Use of a protective cup is, for obvious reasons, required in the men's game; thigh pads and shinguards are also being required for women goalkeepers as of 2007.

Losing chess began to gain popularity in the 20th century, which was facilitated by some publications about this variant in the UK, Germany, and Italy. Losing chess gained a new surge in popularity at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries as an online game, thanks to the implementation of this variant on FICS in 1996, which greatly contributed to the popularization of losing chess. At that time, numerous engines were being developed, endgame tablebases were being created, materials on strategy were being published, and the opening theory was being developed. International tournaments were held in 1998 and 2001. The internet chess server Lichess facilitates play of the game, referring to it as \"antichess\"; after regular chess it is the most popular variant on the site in terms of numbers of games played. Since 2018 the site has hosted an annual \"Lichess World Championship\" for the variant. Chess.com also added this variant to their server, calling it \"giveaway.\""

Such mistakes can be made from the very first move\u2014it is currently known that a Black win can be forced after 13 of White's 20 legal opening moves. Some of these openings took months of computer time to solve, but wins against common chess openings 1.e4, 1.d4, and 1.d3 consist of simple series of forced captures and can be played from memory by most average players. In the table below, green marks winning first moves for White; red marks losing first moves; and yellow marks moves that are not yet solved. This main variant of losing chess was weakly solved in October 2016; White is able to force a win beginning with 1.e3. This solution is valid for both FICS and \"International\" rules on stalemate. Some lines are trivial , others are quite simple , and some are quite complicated . The most difficult are the following five openings : 1.e3 g5 , 1.e3 e6 , 1.e3 b5 , 1.e3 c5 , and 1.e3 b6 . David Pritchard, the author of The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, wrote that the \"complexity and beauty\" of losing chess is found in its endgame. He noted that, in contrast to regular chess, losing chess endgames with just two pieces require considerable skill to play correctly, whereas three- or four-piece endgames can exceed human capacity to solve precisely. For example, the following endgames may turn out to be quite complicated: 2 Knights vs Rook, 3 Kings vs King, or Bishop+Knight+King vs King. In the latter case, in particular, a win may require more than 60 moves, which means that it is sometimes unattainable due to the fifty-move rule."

The event is traditionally held over Memorial Day weekend, usually the last weekend of May. It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series, the top level of American Championship Car racing, an open-wheel, open-cockpit formula colloquially known as \"Indy Car Racing\". The track itself is nicknamed the \"Brickyard\", as the racing surface was paved in brick in the fall of 1909. One yard of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. The event, billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport. The Triple Crown comprises three of the most prestigious motorsports events in the world, also including the Monaco Grand Prix and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In two different periods, the race was part of FIA World Championships; between 1925 and 1928, the World Manufacturers' Championship and between 1950 and 1960, the Formula One World Championship. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent seating capacity is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000. It shares its date with NASCAR's 600-mile event at Charlotte, with drivers having completed both events in one day before in a so-called Double Duty. The inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. H\u00e9lio Castroneves is the current champion. The most successful drivers are A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr., Rick Mears and H\u00e9lio Castroneves, each of whom has won the race four times. The active driver with the most victories is H\u00e9lio Castroneves.

The most successful car owner is Roger Penske, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Team Penske, which has 18 total wins and 18 poles. Penske also has five wins at the IndyCar Grand Prix, held on the combined road course. The event is steeped in tradition, in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field lining up three-wide for the start, the annual singing of \"Back Home Again in Indiana,\" and the victory lane bottle of milk. Also unique is that qualifying requires the driver to complete four, rather than one, timed laps. Qualifying has a separate weekend."

        "content": "The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex was built in 1909 as a gravel-and-tar track and hosted a smattering of small events, including ones for motorcycles. The first long-distance event, in \"fearful conditions,\" was the 100-lap Prest-O-Lite Trophy in 1909, won by Bob Burman in a Buick. The breakup of the track surface led to two fatal accidents in the first two long-distance events . That these spectacles had attracted 15,000 paying customers persuaded principal owner Carl G. Fisher to spend $155,000 on repaving the track with 3.2 million bricks; he also added a  concrete wall around the track's circumference. During the 1910 Decoration Day weekend, the first events on the newly paved circuit drew 60,000 spectators; Ray Harroun won the  Wheeler-Schebler Trophy in a Marmon. The crowds grew progressively smaller for the rest of the season, however, so the track owners chose to focus on a single race, and considered a 24-hour contest, in the fashion of Le Mans, or a  event. They decided on , the estimated distance a race car could run before dark descended on the track, and a spectacular purse of $25,000, equivalent to  of pure gold. The combination allowed the track to rapidly acquire a privileged status for automobile races. The first \"500\" was held at the Speedway in 1911 on Decoration Day, May 30, , run to a  maximum engine size formula. It saw a field of 40 starters, with Harroun piloting a Marmon Model 32-based Wasp racer\u2014outfitted with his invention, the rear-view mirror. Harroun was declared the winner, although Ralph Mulford protested the official result. Eighty thousand spectators were in attendance, and an annual tradition had been established. Many considered Harroun to be a hazard during the race, as he was the only driver in the race driving without a riding mechanic, who checked the oil pressure and let the driver know when traffic was coming. In 1912, the purse was raised to $50,000, the field was limited to 33 , and a riding mechanic was made mandatory. This second event was won by Joe Dawson in a National, after Ralph de Palma's Mercedes broke. Although the first race was won by an American driver at the wheel of an American car, European makers such as the Italian Fiat or French Peugeot companies soon developed their vehicles to try to win the event, which they did from 1912 to 1919. The 1913 event saw a change to a  maximum engine size. After World War I, the native drivers and manufacturers regained their dominance of the race, and engineer Harry Miller set himself up as the most competitive of the post-war builders. His technical developments allowed him to be indirectly connected to a history of success that would last into the mid-1970s. For musical entertainment before the start of the race, the Purdue All-American Marching Band has been the host band of the race since 1919. In 1946, American operatic tenor and car enthusiast James Melton started the tradition of singing \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" with the Purdue Band before the race when asked to do so on the spur of the moment by Speedway president Tony Hulman. This tradition has continued through the years, notably by actor and singer Jim Nabors from 1972 until 2014. Nabors announced in 2014, citing health-related reasons, that the 2014 Indy 500 would be the last at which he would sing the song. In 2015, the a cappella group Straight No Chaser sang the song before the race, and in the two races held after Nabors' retirement , the singing of the song was done on a rotating basis, with the Spring 2014 winner of The Voice Josh Kaufman performing in 2016. However, the Speedway has returned to a standard singer starting in 2017, with Jim Cornelison doing it for three races as of the 2019 race."

The 1920 race was won by Gaston Chevrolet in a Frontenac, prepared by his brothers, powered by the first eight-cylinder engine to win the 500. For 1923, riding mechanics were no longer required. A supercharged car, ID, first won the race in 1924. In 1925, Pete DePaolo was the first to win at an average over , with a speed of . In the early 1920s, Miller built his 3.0-liter engine, inspired by the Peugeot Grand Prix engine which had been serviced in his shop by Fred Offenhauser in 1914, installing it in Jimmy Murphy's Duesenberg and allowing him to win the 1922 edition of the race. Miller then created his own automobiles, which shared the 'Miller' designation, which, in turn, were powered by supercharged versions of his 2.0- and 1.5-liter engine single-seaters, winning four more races for the engine up to 1929 . The engines powered another seven winners until 1938 , then ran at first with stock-type motors before later being adjusted to the international 3.0-liter formula. After purchasing the Speedway in 1927, Eddie Rickenbacker prohibited supercharging and increased the displacement limit to , while also re-introducing the riding mechanic. In 1935, Miller's former employees, Fred Offenhauser and Leo Goossen, had already achieved their first win with the soon-to-become famous 4-cylinder Offenhauser or \"Offy\" engine. This motor was forever connected with the Brickyard's history with a to-date record total of 27 wins, in both naturally aspirated and supercharged form, and winning a likewise record-holding 18 consecutive years between 1947 and 1964."

With the 500 having been a part of the World Drivers' Championship between 1950 and 1960, Ferrari made a discreet appearance at the 1952 event with Alberto Ascari, but European entries were few and far between during those days. Among the Formula One drivers who did drive at the speedway was five-time world champion, Argentinian Juan Manuel Fangio, though he failed to qualify for the 1958 race. It was not until the Indianapolis 500 was removed from the World Championship calendar that European entries made their return. In 1963, technical innovator Colin Chapman brought his Team Lotus to Indianapolis for the first time, attracted by the large monetary prizes, far bigger than the usual at a European event. Racing a mid-engined car, Scotsman Jim Clark was second in his first attempt in 1963, dominated in 1964 until suffering suspension failure on lap 47, and completely dominated the race in 1965, a victory which also interrupted the success of the Offy, and giving the 4.2-liter Ford V8 its first success at the race. The following year, 1966, saw another British win, this time Graham Hill in a Lola-Ford. The Offenhauser engine was also paired with a European maker, McLaren, obtaining three wins for the chassis, one with the Penske team in 1972 with driver Mark Donohue, and two for the McLaren works team in 1974 and 1976 with Johnny Rutherford. This was also the last time the Offy would win a race, its competitiveness steadily decreasing until its final appearance in 1983. American drivers continued to fill the majority of entries at the Brickyard in the following years, but European technology had taken over. Starting in 1978, most chassis and engines were European, with the only American-based chassis to win during the CART era being the Wildcat and Galmer in 1982 and 1992, respectively. Ford and Chevrolet engines were built in the UK by Cosworth and Ilmor, respectively. Fernando Alonso was the most recent active Formula One driver to race at the Indy 500-mile race, in 2017. Before that, no active F1 driver had competed in the Indy 500 since 1984."

As a gesture to the nostalgic Centennial Era celebration , tickets for the 2009 race donned the moniker \"93rd 500 Mile International Sweepstakes\". It is the first time since 1980 that the \"Sweepstakes\" title has been used. In May 2009, the ordinal was used very sparingly, and for the first time since 1981, was not identified on the annual logo. Instead, in most instances in print, television, and radio, the race was referred to as the \"2009 Indianapolis 500\". Since the race was not held during the United States' participation in the two World Wars , the advertised Centennial Era occurred during the 93rd to 95th runnings. To avoid confusion between the 100th anniversary, and the actual number of times the race has been run, references to the ordinal during the Centennial Era were curtailed. Six years later, in 2016, the race celebrated its 100th running with about 350,000 in attendance. Four local actors were hired to portray the Founding Four of James Allison, Carl Fisher, Frank Wheeler, and Arthur Newby during multiple Centennial Era events and the 100th race.

However, from its inception, the race has been widely known as the Indianapolis 500 or, more simply as \"the 500\". In 1919, the race was referred to as the \"Liberty Sweepstakes\" following WWI. From 1920 to 1980, the race officially reverted to the \"International Sweepstakes\" moniker, as printed on the tickets and other paraphernalia, with slight variations over the years. Following WWII, the race was commonly recognized as \"The 500\", \"The 500-Mile Race\", \"Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\", \"Indianapolis 500\", or the simple form \"Indy 500\". Usually the ordinal preceded it. Often the race was also advertised on the radio as the \"Annual Memorial Day race,\" or similar variations. For the 1981 race, the name \"65th Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\" was officially adopted, with all references as the \"International Sweepstakes\" dropped. Since 1981, the race has been formally advertised in this fashion, complete with a unique annual logo with the ordinal almost always included. Around that same time, in the wake of the 1979 entry controversy, and the formation of CART, the race changed to an invitational event, rather than an Open, rendering the \"sweepstakes\" description inappropriate. For nearly a century, the race eschewed any sort of naming rights or title sponsor, a move, though uncommon in the modern sports world, that was well-received by fans. This tradition finally ended in 2016 when a presenting sponsor, PennGrade, was added for the first time. In the 21st century, the facility has also slowly added sponsorship ads on the retaining walls and infield grass. The ESPN-produced ABC telecast of the event did not recognize this sponsorship and instead had Firestone Tires as its presenting sponsorship. The Borg-Warner Trophy, introduced in 1936, proclaims the event as the \"Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\", with no reference at all to the name \"International Sweepstakes\"."

The track is a rounded rectangle, with four distinct turns of identical dimensions, connected by four straightaways . Traditionally, the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of . Since its inception in 1911, the race has always been scheduled on or around Memorial Day. Since 1974, the race has been specifically scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The Sunday of Memorial Day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar, as it is the day of the Indianapolis 500, the Coca-Cola 600, and the Monaco Grand Prix. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race, while miscellaneous preliminary testing is held as early as April. The race is the most prestigious event of the IndyCar calendar, and one of the oldest and most important automobile races. It has been reported to be the largest single-day sporting event in the world. Likewise, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway itself is regarded as the world's largest sporting facility in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded $13 million in 2011, with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports. Similar to NASCAR's Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500 is typically held early in the IndyCar Series season. That is unique to most sports where major events are usually at the end of the respective season. Currently, the Indy 500 is the sixth event of the 17-race IndyCar schedule. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season, and as late as the 1950s, it was sometimes the first championship event of the year. Due to the high prestige of the Indianapolis 500\u2014rivaling or even surpassing the season championship\u2014it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season, and not focus fully on the championship battle until after Indy. Due to safety issues such as aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a rain delay, the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance has been completed. The Indianapolis 500, as well as other IndyCar Series races, does not utilize the green\u2013white\u2013checker finish in case of a late-race yellow. The race can be finished under caution. However, officials may call for a late-race red flag to ensure a green-flag finish, an option that was used in 2014 and 2019. The circuit lacks lights, therefore lateness can become a factor in the cases of lengthy delays."

        "content": "Technical specifications for the Indianapolis 500 are currently written by IndyCar. Rules are generally the same as every other IndyCar race. In the past, particularly during the era in which USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 , rules at Indy slightly differed at times. The result, for example, would be a particular chassis or engine configuration being legal at Indy, but not so at the CART-sanctioned events. This was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s, when \"stock-block\" engines were allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by USAC at Indy, compared to the purpose-built V-8 quad-cam engines. While the \"stock block\" engines were technically legal in CART competition, they were not given the increased boost advantage, which effectively rendered them uncompetitive, and precluded their use by teams. The most famous manifestation of the USAC rules disparity was the Ilmor-built Mercedes-Benz 500I engine fielded by Roger Penske in 1994. Teams may enter up to two machines under a given car number\u2014the \"primary\" car and a \"backup\" car. The backup car is identified by the letter \"T\". For example, the two cars for the #2 team would be numbered #2 and #2T. Both cars may be practiced during the month, but due to engine lease rules, they must share the same engine. It is not uncommon for teams to prefer their backup car, if it is deemed faster, or for other strategic reasons. Additionally, as the month wears on, a \"T car\" may be split off into a separate entry, and reassigned a new number, or be sold to another team. All cars must pass a rigorous technical inspection before receiving a sticker signifying that the car is eligible to practice. Various criteria include minimum weight, dimensions, and approved parts, particularly safety equipment. Before and after qualification attempts, cars must pass another inspection. The pre-qualifying inspection is focused on safety aspects and is done on the pit lane qualifying queue. It is relatively brief, due to the time constraints of the qualifying procedure. The post-qualifying inspection is much more stringent and lengthy, taking place in the garage area. It is to detect deviations from the performance guidelines set forth by the league, and cars can and have been fined or outright disqualified if they fail inspection. During the race, work on the car is permitted, but it is usually limited to routine pit stop work and minor adjustments Pit stop activity is rigorously rehearsed by the crews and in modern times, routine pits stops are regularly completed in under ten seconds. Other more involved work, such as replacing damaged bodywork , can also be completed quickly by the crews. More lengthy repairs are allowed, and since 1998 teams are permitted to return to the garage area to make repairs. However, there are limitations to the extent of repair work allowed and the practicality of such work. Teams are not allowed to change engines, and since 1933 a rule has been in place where teams are not allowed to add oil. In addition, the officials designate a certain lap after which off-track cars being serviced/repaired are no longer permitted to return to the race."

The current four-lap qualifying distance was first introduced in 1920 and has been used every year since 1939. In 2019, the qualifying procedure was refined. \"Bump Day\" and \"Pole Day\" were moved the second day of qualifying and drivers who qualified in positions 10-30 will be locked into the field on day one. On the weekend before the race , all cars are entered into a blind draw for the qualifying order. Saturday: All entries are guaranteed at least one attempt to qualify and can make additional attempts if time permits. At the end of the session, the fastest nine drivers advance to a \"shootout\" session held on the next day to determine pole position and the first three rows of the grid. As mentioned above, drivers who qualify 10th-30th have their spots locked in and will not re-qualify. Drivers who qualify 31st and lower advance to a separate \"shootout\" session also held on the next day to determine the final three spots on the grid. Sunday: The drivers who qualified 31st and lower from Saturday have their original times erased. These drivers are then given only one attempt to re-qualify using the same four-lap format. Drivers who qualify 31st-33rd have their positions locked in. Drivers who finish 34th and lower fail to qualify. The fastest nine drivers from Saturday take part in the \"Fast Nine Shootout\". The qualifying order is based on the times from Saturday's session from slowest to fastest. Once again, the times from Saturday are erased and each driver is given only one attempt. The fastest driver wins the highly coveted pole position and the remaining eight drivers have their positions locked in based on their times. For each attempt, cars are allowed two warm-up laps. At that time, a member of the team is stationed at the north end of the main stretch. He or she must wave a green flag, signaling an attempt, or else the car will be waved off. The attempt can be waved off during any of the four laps by the team, driver, or race officials. If an attempt is waved off after the run starts, the attempt counts towards the three-attempt limit and the previous time is still forfeited unless race officials waved off the attempt because of weather."

Following the 1955 Le Mans disaster, AAA dissolved the Contest Board to concentrate on its membership program aimed at the general motoring public. Speedway owner Tony Hulman founded USAC in 1956, which took over sanctioning of the race and the sport of Championship racing. From 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 also counted toward the FIA's World Championship of Drivers , although few drivers participated in the other races of that series. Italian driver Alberto Ascari was the only European-based driver to race in the 500 during its World Championship years. His appearance in 1952 in a Ferrari was also the only time a Ferrari has ever appeared in the race. Juan Manuel Fangio practiced at the track in 1958 but declined an offer to race. Control issues of monetary prizes and squabbles over technical regulations caused conflict in the 1970s. Soon after the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, and the loss of several key USAC officials in a 1978 plane crash, several key team owners banded together and formed CART in late 1978 to sanction the sport of Indy car racing. The Indianapolis 500 itself, however, remained under the sanctioning control of USAC. It became the lone top-level race the body still sanctioned, as it ultimately dropped all other Indy car races to concentrate on sprints and midgets. For the next three years, the race was not officially recognized on the CART calendar, but the CART teams and drivers comprised the field. By 1983, an agreement was made for the USAC-sanctioned Indy 500 to be recognized on the CART calendar and the race awarded points towards the CART championship. Despite the CART/USAC divide, from 1983 to 1995 the race was run in relative harmony. CART and USAC occasionally quarreled over relatively minor technical regulations but utilized the same machines and the CART-based teams and driver comprised the bulk of the Indy 500 entries each year."

George announced that he intended to reverse the tide of dramatic cost increases, the decreasing number of ovals in the CART series, and to allow for more opportunity for drivers from USAC sprint-car ranks. Detractors accused George of using the 500 as leverage to allow the Speedway to gain complete control of the sport of open-wheel racing in the United States. In response to CART's 1996 schedule that put several races in direct conflict with the first Indy Racing League events, George announced that 25 of the 33 starting positions at the 1996 Indy 500 would be reserved for the top 25 cars in IRL points standings. This effectively left eight starting positions open to the CART-regulars that chose not to participate in the IRL races and would be the first time that not all 33 spots were open for qualification in the history of the race. CART refused to compromise on the schedule conflicts, skip the IRL races required to accumulate the qualifying points, boycott the race, and stage a competing event, the U.S. 500, on the same day at Michigan. Veteran Buddy Lazier won a competitive but crash-filled 1996 Indy 500. Two CART teams, Walker Racing and Galles Racing, competed in the Indianapolis 500 to fulfill sponsor obligations and were welcomed without incident. The U.S. 500, meanwhile was marred by a crash on the pace laps that forced ten teams to use backup cars. For 1997, new rules for less expensive cars and \"production-based\" engines were put into place. The move made it such that the IRL utilized different and incompatible equipment from CART; no CART-based teams would enter the Indy 500 for the next three years. CART would run a 300-mile race Gateway International Raceway on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend from 1997\u20131999 to avoid a conflict. In 2000, Target Chip Ganassi Racing, still a CART-mainstay, decided to compete at Indianapolis with drivers Jimmy Vasser and Juan Pablo Montoya. On race day, Montoya dominated the event, leading 167 of the 200 laps to victory. In 2001, Penske Racing returned and won the race with driver H\u00e9lio Castroneves. Penske and Castroneves repeated with a win in 2002. By 2003, Ganassi, Penske and Andretti Green defected to the IRL permanently. CART went bankrupt later in the year, and its rights and infrastructure were purchased by remaining car owners, and it became the Champ Car World Series. The two series continued to operate separately through 2007. In early 2008, the two series were unified to create a single open-wheel championship after a 12-year split being run under Indy Racing League/IMS control\u2014known as the IndyCar Series.

        "content": "From 1994 to 2014, several NASCAR drivers were able to compete in both the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte on the same day. Since 1993, the Coca-Cola 600 has been scheduled in the evening the same day as the Indy 500. The effort has been known as \"Double Duty\". After the Indy 500, drivers would catch a helicopter directly from the Speedway to Indianapolis International Airport. From there they would fly to Concord Regional Airport, and ride a helicopter to the NASCAR race. John Andretti, Tony Stewart, and Robby Gordon attempted the feat, with Kurt Busch being the latest in 2014. In 2001, Tony Stewart became the first driver to complete the full race distance in both races on the same day. For 2005, the start of Indianapolis was pushed back to 1 p.m. EDT to improve television ratings. This significantly closed the window for a driver to be able to race both events on the same day. Two drivers, Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt, have won the Indianapolis 500 and the Daytona 500. Foyt also won the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, America's premier endurance races, as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Foyt won Le Mans in 1967, about one month after winning his third Indy 500. Andretti won the  Formula One World Championship and is a three-time Sebring winner . Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Rutherford once won one of the Daytona 500 qualifying races. In 2010, Chip Ganassi became the first car owner to win the Daytona and Indianapolis 500s in the same year, with Jamie McMurray winning the Daytona 500 and Dario Franchitti winning the Indianapolis 500. In 2010, Bruton Smith , offered $20 million to any driver, IndyCar or NASCAR, who can win both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day starting in 2011, a feat that had never been accomplished. For 2011, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved the start time of the Indy 500 back to 12:15 PM EDT , which re-opened the window for travel. Brad Keselowski suggested that he would consider answering the challenge in 2014. It was announced on March 4, 2014, that Kurt Busch would attempt to qualify for the 2014 Indianapolis 500, driving a fifth car for the Andretti Autosport team. Busch completed all 500 miles at Indy to finish sixth but dropped out of the 600 with a blown engine just past the 400-mile mark. For 2019, NBC Sports and the Speedway changed the start time. The engines started at 12:38 PM for a start time of 12:45 PM."

        "content": "Louis Meyer requested a glass of buttermilk after winning his second Indy 500 race in 1933. After winning his third title in 1936, he requested another glass but instead received a bottle. He was captured by a photographer in the act of swigging from the bottle while holding up three fingers to signify the third win. A local dairy company executive recognized the marketing opportunity in the image and, being unaware Meyer was drinking buttermilk, offered a bottle of milk to the winners of future races. Milk has been presented each year since then, apart from 1947 to 1955. Modern drivers are offered a choice of whole, 2%, and skim. At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, winner Emerson Fittipaldi, who owned and operated an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview. He eventually relented and also drank from the milk bottle later in the post-race ceremonies after the broadcast was over, but the public relations damage had already been done. The snub led to Fittipaldi being booed at the next ChampCar race, the Milwaukee Mile, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the heart of dairy country, and by some, as late as 2008 in which he drove the pace car. In 2016, as a promotion, the track gave out commemorative bottles of milk to 100,000 attendees to toast the winner with milk after the race."

        "content": "Radio coverage of the race dates back to 1922. The race has been broadcast live on the radio in its entirety by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network since 1953. The Hulmans did not allow live television coverage of the 500 until 1986, largely to maximize gate attendance. The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on WFBM-TV , after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on closed-circuit television in theaters around the country. From 1965 through 1970, a highlighted version of the race was shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports. From 1971 through 1985, an edited same-day, tape delay broadcast of the race was shown in prime time. The race broadcast was edited down to either two or three hours in duration . From 1986 through 2018, ABC televised the race live in its entirety. However, at the request of the Speedway, Indianapolis affiliate WRTV was required to blackout the live broadcast and carry it on tape delay in prime time to encourage local race attendance; WRTV would air the ABC primetime lineup in the afternoon. In 2007 , the race was first aired in high-definition. In 2016, the IMS declared a sell-out of race tickets for the 100th running of the event, meaning that WRTV would be allowed to air the race live for the first time since 1950. Under the live coverage arrangement, the Indianapolis affiliate of the network airing the race airs that day's programming in a transposed arrangement, with network primetime programming airing during the race and transmitted to the affiliate in advance , while the race airs on tape delay in prime time. Coverage of time trials on ABC dates back to 1961. ABC covered time trials in various live and in tape-delayed formats from 1961 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2018. ESPN carried various portions of time trials from 1987 to 2008. Versus covered time trials from 2009 to 2013. Practice sessions have been streamed live online dating back to at least 2001. In 2019, coverage of the Indianapolis 500 moved to NBC, as part of a new three-year contract that unifies the IndyCar Series' television rights with NBC Sports , and replaces the package of five races broadcast by ABC with an eight-race package on NBC. The Indianapolis 500 is one of the eight races; this contract ended ABC's 54-year tenure as broadcaster of the race. WTHR is now the local broadcaster of the race under this contract; the existing blackout policy remains, though speedway officials have left the door open to allowing WTHR to air the race live in the event of a sellout. In contrast with the usual sell-out policy, in 2020, the race aired live on WTHR, as IMS owner Roger Penske announced on April 4 there would be no public admission for any of the year's events due to a rise in COVID-19 cases in the state. The race was also shown live in 2021 on WTHR due to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's restricted capacity amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."

        "content": "Birmingham City Football Club is a professional football club in Birmingham, England. Formed in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance, it was renamed Small Heath in 1888, Birmingham in 1905, and Birmingham City in 1943. Since 2011, the first team have competed in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. As Small Heath, they played in the Football Alliance before becoming founder members and first champions of the Football League Second Division. The most successful period in their history was in the 1950s and early 1960s. They achieved their highest finishing position of sixth in the First Division in the 1955\u201356 season and reached the 1956 FA Cup Final. Birmingham played in two Inter-Cities Fairs Cup finals, in 1960, as the first English club side to reach a major European final, and again the following year. They won the League Cup in 1963 and again in 2011. Birmingham have played in the top tier of English football for around half of their history: the longest period spent outside the top division, between 1986 and 2002, included two brief spells in the third tier of English football, during which time they won the Football League Trophy twice. St Andrew's has been their home ground since 1906. They have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours, with whom they play the Second City derby. The club's nickname is Blues, after the colour of their kit, and the fans are known as Bluenoses."

        "title": "Birmingham City F.C._History",
        "content": "The early years Birmingham City were founded as Small Heath Alliance in 1875, and from 1877 played their home games at Muntz Street. The club turned professional in 1885, and three years later became the first football club to become a limited company with a board of directors, under the name of Small Heath F.C. Ltd. From the 1889\u201390 season they played in the Football Alliance, which ran alongside the Football League. In 1892, Small Heath, along with the other Alliance teams, were invited to join the newly formed Football League Second Division. They finished as champions, but failed to win promotion via the test match system; the following season promotion to the First Division was secured after a second-place finish and test match victory over Darwen. The club adopted the name Birmingham Football Club in 1905, and moved into their new home, St Andrew's Ground, the following year. Matters on the field failed to live up to their surroundings. Birmingham were relegated in 1908, obliged to apply for re-election two years later, and remained in the Second Division until after the First World War. Frank Womack's captaincy and the creativity of Scottish international playmaker Johnny Crosbie contributed much to Birmingham winning their second Division Two title in 1920\u201321. Womack went on to make 515 appearances, a club record for an outfielder, over a twenty-year career. 1920 also saw the debut of the 19-year-old Joe Bradford, who went on to score a club record 267 goals in 445 games, and won 12 caps for England. In 1931, manager Leslie Knighton led the club to their first FA Cup Final, which they lost 2\u20131 to Second Division club West Bromwich Albion. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, with much reliance placed on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs to make up for the lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1939, the last full season before the Football League was abandoned for the duration of the Second World War. Birmingham City: Post-war success The name Birmingham City F.C. was adopted in 1943. Under Harry Storer, appointed manager in 1945, the club won the Football League South wartime league and reached the semifinal of the first post-war FA Cup. Two years later they won their third Second Division title, conceding only 24 goals in the 42-game season. Storer's successor Bob Brocklebank, though unable to stave off relegation in 1950, brought in players who made a major contribution to the club's successes of the next decade. When Arthur Turner took over as manager in November 1954, he made them play closer to their potential, and a 5\u20131 win on the last day of the 1954\u201355 season confirmed them as champions. In their first season back in the First Division, Birmingham achieved their highest league finish of sixth place. They also reached the FA Cup final, losing 3\u20131 to Manchester City in the game notable for City's goalkeeper Bert Trautmann playing the last 20 minutes with a broken bone in his neck. The following season the club lost in the FA Cup semifinal for the third time since the war, this time beaten 2\u20130 by Manchester United's \"Busby Babes\". Birmingham became the first English club side to take part in European competition when they played their first group game in the inaugural Inter-Cities Fairs Cup competition on 15 May 1956; they went on to reach the semifinal where they drew 4\u20134 on aggregate with Barcelona, losing the replay 2\u20131. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, losing 4\u20131 on aggregate to Barcelona in the 1960 Fairs Cup final and 4\u20132 to A.S. Roma the following year. In the 1961 semifinal they beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club won a competitive game in the San Siro until Arsenal managed it more than 40 years later. Gil Merrick's side saved their best form for cup competitions. Though opponents in the 1963 League Cup final, local rivals Aston Villa, were pre-match favourites, Birmingham raised their game and won 3\u20131 on aggregate to lift their first major trophy. In 1965, after ten years in the top flight, they returned to the Second Division. Investment, promotion and decline Businessman Clifford Coombs took over as chairman in 1965, luring Stan Cullis out of retirement to manage the club. Cullis's team played attractive football which took them to the semifinals of the League Cup in 1967 and of the FA Cup in 1968, but league football needed a different approach. Successor Freddie Goodwin produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semifinal. Two years later, the club raised money by selling Bob Latchford to Everton for a British record fee of \u00a3350,000, but without his goals the team struggled. Sir Alf Ramsey briefly managed the club before Jim Smith took over in 1978. With relegation a certainty, the club sold Trevor Francis to Nottingham Forest, making him the first player transferred for a fee of \u00a31\u00a0million; Francis had scored 133 goals in 329 appearances over his nine years at Birmingham. Smith took Birmingham straight back to the First Division, but a poor start to the 1981\u201382 season saw him replaced by Ron Saunders, who had just resigned from league champions Aston Villa. Saunders' team struggled to score goals and were relegated in 1984. They bounced back up, but the last home game of the 1984\u201385 promotion season, against Leeds United, was marred by rioting, culminating in the death of a boy when a wall collapsed on him. This was on the same day as the Bradford City stadium fire, and the events at St Andrew's formed part of the remit of Mr Justice Popplewell's inquiry into safety at sports grounds. The club lacked stability both on and off the field. Saunders quit after FA Cup defeat to non-League team Altrincham, staff were laid off, the training ground was sold, and by 1989 Birmingham were in the Third Division for the first time in their history. In April 1989 the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain, bought the club. A rapid turnover of managers, the absence of promised investment, and a threatened mass refusal of players to renew contracts was relieved only by a victorious trip to Wembley in the Associate Members' Cup. Terry Cooper delivered promotion, but the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International put the Kumars' businesses into receivership; in November 1992 BCCI's liquidator put up for sale their 84% holding in the football club. Sale and reconstruction The club continued in administration for four months, until publisher David Sullivan bought it for \u00a3700,000, installed the then 23-year-old Karren Brady as managing director and allowed Cooper money for signings. On the last day of the season, the team avoided relegation back to the third tier, but after a poor start to the 1993\u201394 season Cooper was replaced by Barry Fry. The change did not prevent relegation, but Fry's first full season brought promotion back to the second tier as champions, and victory over Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy via Paul Tait's golden goal completed the \"lower-league Double\". After one more year, Fry was dismissed to make way for the return of Trevor Francis. Reinforced by players with top-level experience, including Manchester United captain Steve Bruce, Francis's team narrowly missed out on a play-off position in 1998, and three years of play-off semifinal defeats followed. They reached the 2001 League Cup final against Liverpool at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time, but the match went to a penalty shoot-out which Liverpool won. By October 2001, lack of progress had made Francis's position untenable; after a 6\u20130 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent. Bruce's return as manager shook up a stale team; he took them from mid-table to the play-offs, and beat Norwich City on penalties in the final to secure promotion to the Premier League. Motivated by the inspirational Christophe Dugarry, Birmingham's first top-flight season for 16 years finished in mid-table. Loan signing Mikael Forssell's 17 league goals helped Birmingham to a top-half finish in 2003\u201304, but when he was injured, the 2004\u201305 team struggled for goals. In July 2005, chairman David Gold said it was time to \"start talking about being as good as anyone outside the top three or four\" with \"the best squad of players for 25 years\". Injuries, loss of form, and lack of transfer window investment saw them relegated in a season whose lowlight was a 7\u20130 FA Cup defeat to Liverpool. Jermaine Pennant and Emile Heskey left for record fees, many others were released, but Bruce's amended recruitment strategy, combining free-transfer experience with young \"hungry\" players and shrewd exploitation of the loan market, brought automatic promotion at the end of a season which had included calls for his head. The Chinese years In July 2007, Hong Kong-based businessman Carson Yeung bought 29.9% of shares in the club, making him the biggest single shareholder, with a view to taking full control in the future. Uncertain as to his future under possible new owners, Bruce left in mid-season. His successor, Scotland national team manager Alex McLeish, was unable to stave off relegation, but achieved promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt. Yeung's company completed the takeover in 2009, and the team finished in ninth place, their highest for 51 years. In 2011, they combined a second League Cup, defeating favourites Arsenal 2\u20131 with goals from Nikola \u017digi\u0107 and Obafemi Martins and securing qualification for the Europa League, with relegation back to the second tier, after which McLeish resigned to join Aston Villa. Birmingham narrowly failed to reach the knockout rounds of the Europa League and the play-off final. With the club in financial turmoil and under a transfer embargo, manager Chris Hughton left. Under Lee Clark, Birmingham twice retained their divisional status, albeit through Paul Caddis's 93rd-minute goal in the last match of 2013\u201314 to avoid relegation on goal difference, but continued poor form saw him dismissed in October 2014. Gary Rowett stabilised the team and led them to two tenth-place finishes before being controversially dismissed by new owners Trillion Trophy Asia in favour of the \"pedigree\" of Gianfranco Zola, who would aid the club's \"strategic, long-term view\" to take the club in a new direction. Two wins from 24 matches under Zola left Birmingham needing two wins from the last three games to stay up, which they achieved under the managership of Harry Redknapp. Redknapp lasted another month, his former assistant Steve Cotterill five months, leaving successor Garry Monk anotherultimately successfulrelegation battle. Despite budgetary restrictions and a nine-point deduction for breaches of the League's Profitability and Sustainability rules, the team finished 17th in 2018\u201319; however, Monk was sacked in June after conflict with the board. He was succeeded by his assistant, Pep Clotet, initially as caretaker. In the 2019\u201320 season, a season that was suspended from March to June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the club once again avoided relegation despite a 14-match winless run at the end of the season and the threat of a further points deduction. Academy product Jude Bellingham was sold to Borussia Dortmund in the summer for a club-record deal reported to be worth up to \u00a330\u00a0million, after which Aitor Karanka lasted eight months as head coach before being replaced by former Birmingham player Lee Bowyer."

        "content": "The Small Heath Alliance members decided among themselves that their colours would be blue; in the early days, they wore whatever blue shirt they had. The first uniform kit was a dark blue shirt with a white sash and white shorts. Several variations on a blue theme were tried; the one that stuck was the royal blue shirt with a white \"V\", adopted during the First World War and retained until the late 1920s. Though the design changed, the royal blue remained. In 1971 they adopted the \"penguin\" striproyal blue with a broad white central front panelwhich lasted five years. Since then they have generally worn plain, nominally royal blue shirts, though the actual shade used has varied. Shorts have been either blue or white, and socks usually blue, white or a combination. White, yellow, red and black, on their own or in combination, have been the most frequently used colours for the away kit. There were aberrations: the 1992 kit, sponsored by Triton Showers, was made of a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. The home shirt has only once featured stripes: in 1999, the blue shirt had a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time. When the club changed its name from Small Heath to Birmingham in 1905 it adopted the city's coat of arms as its badge, although this was not always worn on the shirts. The 1970s \"penguin\" shirt carried the letters \"BCFC\" intertwined at the centre of the chest. The Sports Argus newspaper ran a competition in 1972 to design a new badge for the club. The winning entry, a line-drawn globe and ball, with a ribbon carrying the club's name and date of foundation, in plain blue and white, was adopted by the club but not worn on playing shirts until 1976, after the design was granted by the College of Arms in 1975. The design recorded at the College did not include the ribbon and was blazoned as \"A football ensigned by a terrestrial globe proper\". This was granted as an heraldic badge to the English Football League and was licensed to Birmingham City. An experiment was made in the early 1990s with colouring in the globe and ball, but was soon abandoned. In June 2020, the club announced a four-year partnership with Nike as supplier of kits, which carry the logo of the club's principal sponsor, Irish bookmaker BoyleSports. The 2021\u201322 home kit consists of a blue shirt with patterned front in two shades of blue, white shorts and blue socks, while the away kit has a yellow shirt with blue pinstripes and trim, similar to the Europa League kit of ten years before, with blue shirts and white socks. The club rarely spends more than three seasons with the same kit supplier. The first sponsor to have its name on the shirt was Birmingham-based brewery Ansells in 1983. They withdrew in mid-1985, and the shirts went unsponsored until January 1987, when Co-op Milk paid a \"five-figure sum\" to have its name displayed until the end of the season, which was a relief to the club not only financially; the vice-chairman claimed that as a \"big club\u00a0... people expect us to have a shirt sponsor and we have been lagging behind\". Later sponsors included car retailer PJ Evans/Evans Halshaw , Mark One , Triton Showers , Auto Windscreens , Phones 4u , Flybe , F&C Investments , foreign exchange company RationalFX , \"lifestyle and leisure\" business EZE Group , e-cigarette company Nicolites , mobile payment enabler Zapaygo , and 888sport ."

        "content": "Small Heath Alliance played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, Bordesley Green. As interest grew, they moved to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, where admission could be charged. A year later, they moved again, to a field adjoining Muntz Street, Small Heath, near the main Coventry Road, with a capacity of about 10,000. The Muntz Street ground was adequate for 1880s friendly matches, and the capacity was gradually raised to around 30,000, but when several thousand spectators scaled walls and broke down turnstiles to get into a First Division match against Aston Villa, it became clear that it could no longer cope with the demand. Director Harry Morris identified a site for a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile\u00a0from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies are known to have camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club. The original capacity of St Andrew's was reported as 75,000, with 4,000 seats in the Main Stand and space for 22,000 under cover. By 1938 the official capacity was 68,000, and February 1939 saw the attendance record set at the fifth round FA Cup tie against Everton, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the Chief Constable ordered the ground's closure because of the danger from air raids; it was the only ground to be thus closed, and was only re-opened after the matter was raised in Parliament. It was badly damaged during the Birmingham Blitz: the Railway End and the Kop as a result of bombing, while the Main Stand burnt down when a fireman mistook petrol for water. The replacement Main Stand used a propped cantilever roof design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' view of the pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had been put on the Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was down to about 55,000. Resulting from the 1986 Popplewell Report into the safety of sports grounds and the later Taylor Report, the capacity of St Andrew's was set at 28,235 for safety reasons, but it was accepted that the stadium had to be brought up to modern all-seated standards. After the last home game of the 1993\u201394 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolishedfans took home a significant proportion as souvenirsto be replaced at the start of the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing round the corner into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager, but the Main Stand has still to be modernised. In 2019, the club website listed the stadium capacity as 29,409. In 2004 a proposal was put forward to build a \"sports village\" comprising a 55,000-capacity City of Birmingham Stadium, other sports and leisure facilities, and a super casino, to be jointly financed by Birmingham City Council, Birmingham City F.C. and the casino group Las Vegas Sands. The feasibility of the plan depended on the government issuing a licence for a super casino, and Birmingham being chosen as the venue, but this did not happen. The club have planning permission to redevelop the Main Stand, but club and council continued to seek alternative sources of funding for the City of Birmingham Stadium project. In 2013, the Birmingham City Supporters' Trust's application for listing St Andrew's as an Asset of Community Value a building or other land whose main use \"furthers the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community\" and where it is realistic to believe it could do so in the future.under the Localism Act 2011 was approved by Birmingham City Council. This requires any proposed sale to be notified to the Council, and provides for a six-month moratorium on that sale to allow the Trust and other community groups to submit their own bid. In 2018, the club's owners agreed a three-year sponsorship deal under which the name became St Andrew's Trillion Trophy Stadium."

        "content": "Birmingham fans consider their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours geographically, with whom they contest the Second City derby. Lesser rivalries include fellow West Midlands clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 Football Fans Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, though this was not always the case. Birmingham's supporters are generally referred to as \"Bluenoses\" in the media and by the fans themselves; the name is also used in a derogatory manner by fans of other clubs. A piece of public sculpture in the form of a ten-times-life-size head lying on a mound near the St Andrew's ground, Ondr\u00e9 Nowakowski's Sleeping Iron Giant, has been repeatedly defaced with blue paint on its nose. Between 1994 and 1997 the club mascot took the form of a blue nose, though it is now a dog named Beau Brummie, a play on the name Beau Brummell and Brummie, the slang word for a person from Birmingham. A number of supporters' clubs are affiliated to the football club, both in England and abroad. An action group was formed in 1991 to protest against chairman Samesh Kumar, the club blamed an internet petition for the collapse of the purchase of player Lee Bowyer in 2005, and antipathy towards the board provoked hostile chanting and a pitch invasion after the last match of the 2007\u201308 season, but when the club was in financial difficulties, supporters contributed to schemes which funded the purchase of players Brian Roberts in 1984 and Paul Peschisolido in 1992. A supporters' trust was formed under the auspices of Supporters Direct in 2012. There have been several fanzines published by supporters. Made in Brum, first issued in 2000, was the only one regularly on sale in 2013. The Zulu began some years earlier and ran for at least 16 seasons. The hooligan firm associated with the club, the Zulu Warriors, were unusual in that they had multi-racial membership at a time when many such firms had associations with racist or right-wing groups. The fans' anthem, an adaptation of Harry Lauder's \"Keep Right On to the End of the Road\", was adopted during the 1956 FA Cup campaign. The Times football correspondent described in his Cup Final preview how Player Alex Govan is credited with popularising the song, by singing it on the coach on the way to the quarter-final and when he revealed in an interview that it was his favourite."

        "content": "Small Heath F.C. became a limited company in 1888; its first share issue was to the value of \u00a3650. The board was made up of local businessmen and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former Walsall F.C. chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made redundancies, and sold off assets, including the club's training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until Sport Newspapers' proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars' 84% holding for \u00a3700,000 from BCCI's liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City plc, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the Alternative Investment Market in 1997 with an issue of 15\u00a0million new shares, raising \u00a37.5\u00a0million of new investment. It made a pre-tax profit of \u00a34.3M in the year ending 31 August 2008. In July 2007, Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung, via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange -listed company Grandtop International Holdings Limited , bought 29.9% of the plc from its directors. Although his intention to take full control of the club initially came to nothing, GIH completed the purchase in October 2009 at a total cost of \u00a381.5M, re-registered the club as a private company, and renamed the holding company Birmingham International Holdings . Trading in BIH shares was suspended in June 2011 after Yeung's arrest on charges of money-laundering. Publication of financial results was repeatedly delayed, which led the Football League to impose a transfer embargo, and offers for the club were entertained from 2012 onwards. After Yeung resigned his positions with both club and company in early 2014, share trading resumed, and following his conviction, efforts intensified to dispose of the club, which had to be done piecemeal in order to retain BIH's share listing. Going into 2015, the Football League made public their concerns over Yeung's attempts to impose his choice of directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, as illustrated by the failure of three directors, including the club's de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation. In June 2015, the receivers struck deals with the previous major shareholders such that legal action against them would be dropped in return for their agreement not to obstruct any transfer of ownership to their preferred bidder, the British Virgin Islands-registered investment vehicle Trillion Trophy Asia , wholly owned by Chinese businessman Paul Suen Cho Hung, who in turn agreed that the company would not be sold on within two years. The process completed in October 2016, leaving TTA owning 50.64% of BIH's share capital, a level of ownership that required them to make an offer for the remainder."

Walter Abbott holds the records for the most goals scored in a season, in 1898\u201399, with 34 league goals in the Second Division and 42 goals in total. The club's widest victory margin in the league was 12\u20130, a scoreline which they achieved once in the Football Alliance, against Nottingham Forest in 1899, and twice in the Second Division, against Walsall Town Swifts in 1892 and Doncaster Rovers in 1903. They have lost a league match by an eight-goal margin on eight occasions: twice in the Football Alliance and five times in the First Division, all away from home, and once at home, beaten 8\u20130 by AFC Bournemouth in the Championship in 2014.

Birmingham's home attendance record was set at the fifth-round FA Cup tie against Everton on 11 February 1939. It is variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. The highest transfer fee received for a Birmingham player is, according to the Sky Sports website, \"a guaranteed \u00a325\u00a0million up front\" received in July 2020 from Borussia Dortmund for Jude Bellingham, which made him the most expensive 17-year-old in world football; the deal also included add-ons \"worth 'several millions more'\".

For example, if the batter bats a base hit which allows a teammate on a higher base to reach home and so score a run, then the batter gets credited with an RBI. Before the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs batted in were not an official baseball statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI statistic was tabulated\u2014unofficially\u2014from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. Common nicknames for an RBI include \"ribby\" , \"rib\", and \"ribeye\". The plural of \"RBI\" is a matter of \"minor controversy\" for baseball fans: it is usually \"RBIs\", in accordance with the usual practice for pluralizing initialisms in English; however, some sources use \"RBI\" as the plural, on the basis that it can stand for \"runs batted in\"."

In addition, career RBIs are often cited in debates over who should be elected to the Hall of Fame. However, critics, particularly within the field of sabermetrics, argue that RBIs measure the quality of the lineup more than it does the player himself. This is because an RBI can only be credited to a player if one or more batters preceding him in the batting order have reached base . This implies that better offensive teams \u2014and therefore, the teams in which the most players get on base\u2014 tend to produce hitters with higher RBI totals than equivalent hitters on lesser-hitting teams."

At the same time the ABL was being formed, the National Basketball Association was creating the Women's National Basketball Association . The ABL began league competition in the Fall of 1996, while the WNBA launched its first game in June 1997. Both organizations came into existence during a surge in popularity for women's basketball in the United States that followed the perfect 35\u20130 national championship season for the Connecticut Huskies in 1995 and the undefeated, gold medal-winning performance of the United States Women's basketball team at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The ABL lasted two full seasons: 1996\u201397 and 1997\u201398. The Atlanta Glory and Long Beach Stingrays folded prior to the start of the 1998\u201399 season, and were replaced by two expansion teams, the Chicago Condors and Nashville Noise. On December 22, 1998, with almost no warning, the ABL declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and suspended operations. Each team had played between 12 and 15 games of the 1998\u201399 season. The ABL got off the ground before the WNBA, and at least early on its quality of play was higher than the rival league. This was partly due to the league's signing of a majority of players from the 1996 USA women's national team.  Although the WNBA was bankrolled by the NBA, the ABL offered higher salaries. The two leagues did not compete directly; the ABL played during the winter while the WNBA played during the summer.  Despite this, the ABL ultimately found the WNBA's stronger financial resources\u2014augmented by the NBA's marketing muscle\u2014to be too much to overcome. The league operated as a single-entity structure, which was intended to control costs until it found its feet.  However, it also meant that even the most basic decisions related to team operations had to go through the league office in Palo Alto, California. League officials were so fixated on national sponsorships that they hamstrung the teams' efforts to market themselves locally. The ABL was also underfinanced. Allison Hodges, general manager of the short-lived Condors, later told The New York Times that she was led to believe league officials rejected her marketing ideas because they clashed with its national focus, only to find out that the league did not have enough money to finance them. Hodges also believed the league had already planned to shut down before announcing the Chapter 11 filing. Of all the ABL cities, Chicago, Seattle, and Atlanta now have WNBA teams."

The Galaxy were founded in 1994 and are owned by Anschutz Entertainment Group . In their early years, the club played its home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Since 2003, they have played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. The team holds a rivalry with the San Jose Earthquakes in the California Cl\u00e1sico and used to play the SuperClasico against city rivals Chivas USA before that team folded in 2014.

The franchise is one of Major League Soccer's most successful teams, with a record five MLS Cups and four additional appearances in the final, and won the Western Conference regular-season title eight times, four Supporters' Shields, two U.S. Open Cups, and one CONCACAF Champions' Cup title. In 2017, the club added the dubious MLS Wooden Spoon to its trophy case for finishing at the bottom of the MLS table.

The team began competing in the first season of the then-new league, which took place in 1996. In the inaugural season, the Galaxy finished first in the Western Conference and contested the first MLS Cup final, finishing as runners-up to D.C. United. In 1997, they started 1\u20137, but went 15\u20139 for the rest of the season to qualify for the playoffs. The Galaxy ended up second in their conference, losing to the Dallas Burn. In 1998, the Galaxy left off on a streak, eventually finishing 24\u20138. The Galaxy defeated the Dallas Burn, 9\u20133 on aggregate. They lost in the semi-final to the Chicago Fire, 2\u20131 on aggregate. The Galaxy again finished first in the Western Conference in 1999, with a final record of 20\u201312, with a win in the CONCACAF Champions' Cup, but lost to D.C. United again 2\u20130. The 2000 season had the Galaxy in second in the Western Division, at 14\u201310\u20138. Despite this, they lost to the Kansas City Wizards after a tied aggregate and a sudden-death game. Los Angeles won the CONCACAF Champions' Cup that same year, one of two American clubs to win the tournament. 2001 was another successful year for Los Angeles, winning the Open Cup and scoring 1,000 all-time points, and with Cobi Jones scoring the 300th goal, but again they fell short by being defeated by Landon Donovan and the San Jose Earthquakes. Again the club clinched first in the Western Conference with a 16\u20139\u20133 record, their fifth time being first. Los Angeles were to take part in FIFA's Club World Cup as Concacaf champions from the previous year, but the tournament was cancelled that year. First MLS Cup In 2002, the Galaxy won their first MLS Cup in the club's fourth appearance by defeating the New England Revolution 1\u20130. In 2003, the Galaxy finished fourth playing more away games due to stadium construction, with the possible existing obstacles, the team finished 9\u201312\u20139. The Galaxy bounced back by gaining second with an 11\u20139\u201310 record. They lost to the Wizards in the final, 0\u20132. In 2005, the Galaxy acquired Landon Donovan from San Jose. The franchise won the Open Cup again ending with a record of 13\u201313\u20136. Having qualified for the playoffs for the 2005 season, The Galaxy has been the only team to appear in the playoffs in all of the league's first ten seasons. They won the 2005 MLS Cup, defeating the New England Revolution in extra time, 1\u20130. The 2006 season began on March 16 with the sudden death of Doug Hamilton, the team's 43-year-old general manager, who suffered a heart attack on board a plane carrying the team back from Costa Rica where they had played Saprissa in the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. The team finished fifth in the Western Conference, eliminating them from playoff contention for the first time since the league's inception. Midway through the season, Steve Sampson was sacked as head coach, replaced by Frank Yallop. The team managed to make a deep run to the U.S. Open Cup final, but lost 3\u20131 against the Chicago Fire. Beckham era In March 2007, Herbalife signed a five-year deal with the Galaxy, worth between $4\u20135\u00a0million a year, to be the club's primary shirt sponsor. Four months later, the club signed David Beckham from Real Madrid. His debut was made at Home Depot Center before a record crowd of nearly 35,000, including many celebrities, coming on in the 78th minute in a 1\u20130 loss to Chelsea in a match during the World Series of Football tournament. The match brought unprecedented TV coverage from ESPN, who used 19 cameras to cover it, including one trained only on Beckham, even when he was on the bench. In that season's SuperLiga, LA reached the final but lost to Mexican side Pachuca on penalties after extra time. LA nearly made the end-of-season play-offs, but were eliminated following a 1\u20130 loss to the Chicago Fire. In the off-season, Cobi Jones retired and, amidst rumors that he was going to be sacked, Yallop resigned as head coach following a friendly match at Home Depot Center. The San Jose Earthquakes bought out his contract and offered a third round draft pick to the Galaxy as compensation to hire Yallop as their new head coach. Yallop was replaced at LA by Ruud Gullit, who signed a three-year contract with the club, making him the highest paid coach in MLS history. Cobi Jones returned as assistant coach. LA went on a promotional tour of Australia and New Zealand, setting attendance records in both countries. 80,295 people showed up at Stadium Australia for the match between Sydney FC and LA Galaxy, which the home side won 5\u20133. They also played a tour of Asia, and competed in the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship in Honolulu, finishing third after beating Sydney 2\u20131 in the third-place match. In the 2008 MLS season, LA went on a seven-game winless streak that saw them drop from first place in the Western Conference to outside playoff contention, prompting the resignation of manager Ruud Gullit and firing of general manager Alexi Lalas. Gullit was replaced by Bruce Arena, who was unable to lead LA into a play-off spot, for the third-straight season. In the following off-season, both club captain David Beckham and vice-captain Landon Donovan were involved in loan deals with European clubs until the beginning of the new MLS season; Beckham to Milan in Italy and Donovan to German club Bayern Munich. Donovan was seeking a permanent transfer to Munich, while Beckham was expected to return to LA in March, prior to the 2009 season. Beckham went on to seek a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the 2010 World Cup, and Milan made a bid for the player that was rejected by LA. One day before his loan deal was to expire, Milan and LA reached an agreement to allow Beckham to stay in Italy until the conclusion of the Rossoneri's season in June, before returning to LA in July. Donovan was not offered a contract by Bayern, and returned to the U.S. in time for the beginning of the 2009 MLS season. In the book The Beckham Experiment by Grant Wahl, Donovan openly criticized Beckham for his handling of the loan deals. Beckham and Donovan would later reconcile upon Beckham's return to LA in July. LA finished the 2009 season top of the Western Conference and runners-up in the MLS Supporters' Shield, qualifying for the 2009 MLS Cup. They reached the final by beating Chivas USA 3\u20132 on aggregate in the quarter-final, and Houston Dynamo 2\u20130, after extra time, in the semi-final. In the final they drew 1\u20131 with Real Salt Lake at Qwest Field in Seattle, but lost 5\u20134 on penalties. By reaching the final, they qualified for the 2010\u201311 CONCACAF Champions League Preliminary Round. After the 2009 success, both Donovan and Beckham again went out on second loan spells. Donovan went to Everton while Beckham returned to Milan, where he ruptured his Achilles tendon and therefore missed his chance at playing in the World Cup for England and subsequently missing most of the Galaxy's 2010 season. In 2010, the Galaxy stayed at the top of the table and won the Supporters' Shield, the first time MLS played a balanced schedule. They then lost to FC Dallas in the Western Conference Final, one game away from making another appearance at MLS Cup. In 2011, a year in which they added the Republic of Ireland's all-time leading goalscorer Robbie Keane, they won their fourth Supporters' Shield with two games remaining, becoming the third-straight team to win consecutive Shields while amassing the second-best points total in MLS history. They followed this up with their third MLS Cup, defeating the Houston Dynamo 1\u20130 in the final. The 2011 MLS Cup was the Galaxy's first MLS Cup Victory in regulation. The 2002 and the 2005 MLS Cup wins were won in overtime. In January 2012, after much speculation, Beckham signed a new two-year deal with LA to secure his short-term future at the club. Despite the new contract, Beckham confirmed in November 2012 that he would be leaving the Galaxy at the end of the 2012 MLS season. On December 1, 2012, the Galaxy won their second-straight MLS Cup victory over the Houston Dynamo, 3\u20131. Galaxy defender Omar Gonzalez won the MLS MVP trophy, heading in the 1\u20131 equalizer in the 60th minute. That goal was quickly followed by a Donovan penalty kick, and Keane sealed the game with another penalty kick in stoppage time. In post-match interviews both Donovan and Beckham remained coy about their future MLS plans. First to five league championships Galaxy finished the 2013 season third in the Western Conference. They reached the conference semi-finals, where they lost 2\u20131 to Real Salt Lake. They also reached the semi-finals of the 2012\u201313 CONCACAF Champions League, but lost 3\u20131 on aggregate to Mexican team Monterrey. Following the defeat to Seattle Sounders FC in the final game of the season with the Supporters' Shield on the line, the team entered the 2014 MLS playoffs defeating Real Salt Lake, advancing to face Seattle once again in the Western Conference Finals, advancing to the MLS Cup by away goals. They played the New England Revolution in the 2014 MLS Cup and won 2\u20131 in overtime, thereby becoming five-time champions, a league record. At the end of the season, longtime LA Galaxy and United States national team player Landon Donovan retired. On January 7, 2015, the LA Galaxy announced the signing of long time Liverpool player Steven Gerrard to an 18-month Designated Player contract, reportedly worth $9\u00a0million. He joined the team in July 2015 following the end of the 2014\u201315 Premier League season, and made his debut in an International Champions Cup against Club Am\u00e9rica on July 11. The club again made headlines by acquiring Mexican star and Barcelona academy product Giovani dos Santos in July as a designated player. Not since the days of Jorge Campos, Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Hern\u00e1ndez in the late 1990s and early 2000s had the Galaxy had a notable Mexican player, let alone one in the prime of his career.  Dos Santos made an impactful impression on the Galaxy early on, scoring on his club debut against Central FC in the CONCACAF Champions League and then in his league debut against the Sounders. In his first five club matches, he had a goal, an assist or both to total with four goals and five assists in that span. Wooden Spoon and rebuilding Before the start of the 2016 season, it was announced that long-time servicing center-back Omar Gonzalez would leave the Galaxy after nine years to C.F. Pachuca. On November 22, 2016, long-time general manager and head coach, Bruce Arena, left the club to begin his second stint as head coach of the United States national team, bringing most of the Galaxy's coaching staff with him, including associate head coach, Dave Sarachan. Arena was replaced as general manager by former Galaxy player Peter Vagenas, and as head coach by his LA Galaxy II counterpart, Curt Onalfo. The front office constructed the team to rely on players from the academy and Galaxy II system. Multiple injuries exposed the naive roster construction, which included erratic performances by Jermaine Jones, and sparse production from Giovanni Dos Santos. With a 6\u201310\u20134 record, the Galaxy fired Curt Onalfo and replaced him with former head coach Sigi Schmid on July 27, 2017. Under Schmid, the club went 2\u20138\u20134 and finished the season in last place overall with a mark of 8\u201318\u20138. It was only the fourth time that the club failed to make the postseason, and the club's first wooden spoon. In March 2018, the team signed Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 on a two-year, $3 million contract with targeted allocation money. With the signing of Ibrahimovi\u0107, the Galaxy's season would be seen promising. The Swede made his debut in the inaugural El Tr\u00e1fico match against LAFC, scoring two goals to end the game with the Galaxy coming from 0\u20133 down to win 4\u20133. One of the goals Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored in that game later claimed MLS Goal of the Year. Los Angeles throughout the season had dealt with defensive struggles and on their last match of the regular season, against Houston Dynamo, the Galaxy were defeated and once again missed the postseason. After the 2018 season, the Galaxy ended Ibrahimovi\u0107's original deal and signed him to a new and higher salaried designated player contract. On March 1, 2019, the team announced they had exercised its one offseason Buyout of a Guaranteed Contract on Giovani dos Santos, thus releasing him from the team. In the 2019 season, the Galaxy welcomed Guillermo Barros Schelotto to the club as head coach. The Galaxy also added a number of players, notably Uruguayan Diego Polenta, Argentine World Cup veteran Cristian Pav\u00f3n, fellow Argentine Favio \u00c1lvarez and Mexican Uriel Antuna. With this, and the emergence of academy product Efra\u00edn \u00c1lvarez, the Galaxy placed fifth in the West and made the playoffs. The season was best remembered for Ibrahimovi\u0107's performances against LAFC, including a hat-trick at home in July and a brace in Banc of California Stadium that August. Ibrahimovi\u0107 finished the season with 30 goals, the second-highest mark in the season and third-highest total in league history . In the playoffs, the Galaxy defeated Minnesota United 2\u20131 before falling to LAFC, 5\u20133. Ibrahimovi\u0107 left the club in November, and of the 2019 signings\u2014most of them on loan\u2014only Pav\u00f3n returned for 2020. The club arranged for a transfer from La Liga club Sevilla, signing a three-year contract with Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez on January 21, 2020, and making him the highest-paid player in the league. At the end of the season, after failing to making the postseason, head coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto was fired, and replaced with Dominic Kinnear as interim manager. On January 5, the Galaxy announced Greg Vanney as the new manager."

The colors were adopted to coincide with David Beckham's arrival with the team in 2007 as part of an overall re-branding exercise spearheaded by then GM Alexi Lalas. Before 2007, the Galaxy played in various color combinations, usually comprising gold, teal green and white with black accents, and often highlighting an iconic sash design from the left shoulder and across the chest. Their original jersey, used in the inaugural 1996 MLS season, reflected the colors of the city of Los Angeles and featured black-and-teal halves, black sleeves with gold and red accents, black shorts and black socks. The Galaxy have had two logos to date. The original brand was gold, teal and black, and featured the Galaxy wordmark superimposed over a golden swirl, with a stylized black outline. The logo was changed in 2007, again to coincide with David Beckham's arrival, and now features a blue shield with a gold border, the LA Galaxy team name, and a quasar at the top of the crest. The quasar, featured prominently on the LA Galaxy's shield, was originally featured on the 1957 Seal of Los Angeles County, as well as the modified Seal of Los Angeles County, California. The name \"Galaxy\" was created by Nike at the conception of the league; the apparel company was also the original uniform supplier for the team."

She won 24 Grand Slam women's singles titles,   19 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, and 21 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. Her 24 Grand Slam singles titles and her total of 64 Grand Slam titles are the most in tennis history. She is considered one of the greatest tennis players of all time. She is currently a Christian minister in Perth, Western Australia. In 1970, Court became the first woman during the Open Era to win the singles Grand Slam . Her all-surfaces singles career-winning percentage of 91.74 is the best of all time according to the Sporteology website. Her Open era singles career winning percentage of 91.02% is unequalled, as is her Open era winning percentage of 91.67% in Grand Slam singles finals. Her win\u2013loss performance in all Grand Slam singles tournaments was 90.00% . She was 95.24% at the Australian Open, 89.80% at the French Open, 85.00% at Wimbledon, and 89.66% at the US Open. She also shares the Open era record for most Grand Slam singles titles as a mother with Kim Clijsters. In 1973, Court set the record for most singles titles won in a single Grand Slam event, with 11 Australian Open wins. This record was surpassed by Rafael Nadal in 2019 when he won his 12th French Open title, but remains a women's record. Court is one of only three players in history to have won the \"Grand Slam Boxed Set\", consisting of every Grand Slam title . Court, however, is the only one in tennis history to complete a Multiple Grand Slam set, twice, in all three disciplines. Uniquely, she won all 12 as an amateur and then after a period of retirement, returned as a professional to win all 12 again. Court is also one of only six tennis players ever to win a Multiple Grand Slam set in two disciplines, matching Roy Emerson, Martina Navratilova, Frank Sedgman, Doris Hart, and Serena Williams. The International Tennis Hall of Fame states \"For sheer strength of performance and accomplishment there has never been a tennis player to match .\" In 2010, the Herald Sun called her the greatest female tennis player of all time, a view supported by Evonne Goolagong Cawley. Having grown up as a Roman Catholic, Court became associated with Pentecostalism in the 1970s and became a Christian minister in that tradition in 1991. She later founded Margaret Court Ministries."

        "content": "Court was born in Albury, New South Wales, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Smith and Catherine Beaufort. She has two older brothers, Kevin and Vincent, and an older sister, June Shanahan. A natural left-hander, she was persuaded to change to a right-hand grip. She began playing tennis when she was eight years old and was 18 in 1960 when she won the first of seven consecutive singles titles at the Australian Championships. She became the first Australian woman to win a Grand Slam tournament abroad when she won the French and US Championships in 1962. The next year, she became the first Australian woman to win Wimbledon. Across singles, doubles and mixed doubles, she has won a remarkable 64 Grand Slams. After the tournament in Munich, Germany in August 1966, Court temporarily retired from tennis. In 1967, she married Barry Court, whose father, Charles Court, and brother, Richard Court, were premiers of Western Australia. She returned to tennis in November 1967, and in 1970 won all four Grand Slam singles titles. The next year, she lost the Wimbledon singles final to Evonne Goolagong Cawley while pregnant with her first child, Daniel, who was born in March 1972. She made a comeback that year, playing in the US Open and throughout 1973. Her second child, Marika, was born in 1974. She started playing again in November of that year. After missing most of 1976 after having her third child, she returned to the tour in early 1977 but retired permanently that year when she learned she was expecting her fourth child. Her last Grand Slam tournament singles appearance was in the 1975 US Open. Her last Grand Slam tournament appearance overall was in the 1976 Australian Open in women's doubles. Court is one of only three players to achieve a career \"boxed set\" of Grand Slam titles, winning every possible Grand Slam title\u2014singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles\u2014at all four Grand Slam events. The others are Doris Hart and Martina Navratilova. However, Court is the only person to win all 12 Grand Slam events at least twice. She also is unique in having completed \"boxed sets\" both before the Open Era and after it began. Court lost a heavily publicised and U.S.\u2013televised challenge match to a former world No. 1 male tennis player, the 55-year-old Bobby Riggs, on 13 May 1973, in Ramona, California. Court was the top-ranked women's player at the time, and the New York Times claimed that she did not take the match seriously because it was a mere exhibition. Using a mixture of lobs and drop shots, Riggs beat her 6\u20132, 6\u20131. Four months later, Billie Jean King beat Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes match in the Houston Astrodome. In January 2003, Show Court One at the sports and entertainment complex Melbourne Park was renamed Margaret Court Arena. Since 2012, the arena has attracted calls for its name to be changed on the basis of Court's statements against gay and lesbian rights."

With a height and reach advantage and being extremely strong, she was very formidable at the net and had an effective overhead shot. She was considered unusually mobile for her size and played an all attack, serve and volley style which, when added to her big serve, dominated conservative defensive players. Part of what helped her win was her commitment to fitness training. Court was dubbed \"The Aussie Amazon\" because she did weights, circuit training and running along sandy hillsides. This training helped keep her relatively injury-free through most of her career. Court won a record 64 Grand Slam tournament titles, including a record 24 singles titles, 19 women's doubles titles and a record 21 mixed doubles titles. The total includes two shared titles at the Australian Championships/Open in 1965 and 1969. The mixed doubles finals of those years were not played because of bad weather and the titles are shared by both of the finalist pairs.

She was 146\u20132 against unseeded players in Grand Slam singles tournaments. Court is the only player to have won the Grand Slam in both singles and mixed doubles. She won the singles Grand Slam in 1970, the mixed doubles Grand Slam in 1963 with fellow Australian Ken Fletcher and the mixed doubles Grand Slam in 1965 with three different partners . Court won more than half of all the Grand Slam contests held in 1963 , 1964 , 1965 , 1969 , 1970 and 1973 . According to the end-of-year rankings compiled by London's Daily Telegraph from 1914 to 1972, Court was ranked world No. 1 six times: 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1969 and 1970.

Her television show, A Life of Victory, airs on Sundays on the Australian Christian Channel and locally in Perth on community television station West TV.

        "content": "Court has been a consistent critic of LGBT rights and same-sex marriage in Australia. In 2012, she opposed proposed same-sex marriage reforms. Court has been criticised for such statements by openly gay tennis players Billie Jean King, Rennae Stubbs and Martina Navratilova, and in 2012, an LGBT rights protest group called for the renaming of Margaret Court Arena. Court was strongly criticised in May 2017 after writing a letter to The West Australian decrying Qantas for being a corporate supporter of same-sex marriage and saying that she would boycott the airline. The letter, and further follow-up interviews, again led to calls from some Australians and tennis players to rename the Margaret Court Arena. Some politicians, including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, rejected calls for the change of name, saying the name celebrates Margaret Court as a tennis player. Writing in the wake of this incident, Russell Jackson noted that Court had always held controversial views, which he described as \"stubbornly immovable\", citing her support for apartheid in 1970 and her criticisms of Navratilova in 1990 as examples. He added that this and the similar incident from 2012 are calculated provocations, allowing Court to portray herself as the victim and use the publicity to her advantage, and show that \"for better or worse, Court is now the principal architect of her own image\". On 23 January 2019, Anna Wintour, in her keynote address for the Australian Open's Inspirational Series, renewed calls for the arena's renaming. Court responded by saying she was \"disappointed\" that someone \"coming from America\" was \"unable to tolerate views that were not in line with her own\" and \"[is] telling us in this nation what to do\". Later in the year, Court called on Tennis Australia to honour her and the 50th anniversary of her 1970 Grand Slam in the same way as it honoured Rod Laver earlier in 2019, arguing that the organisation should disregard her views on same-sex marriage as her tennis achievements are from \"a different phase of my life from where I am now and if we are not big enough as a nation and a game to face those challenges there is something wrong.\" Tennis Australia issued a statement that it \"recognises the tennis achievements of Margaret Court, although her views do not align with our values of equality, diversity and inclusion\" and asserted that it is \"in the process of working through\" how Court's milestone might be included at the 2020 Australian Open. During the tournament, however, high-profile guests Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe paraded a banner calling for the Margaret Court Arena to be renamed in honour of four-time Australian Open champion Evonne Goolagong. In 2020, her Margaret Court Community Outreach charity was denied a Lotterywest grant for a freezer truck on the basis of her public statements on gay people. She subsequently announced she would lodge a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Commission of Western Australia."

The record number of wins is eight each by Lee Haney and Ronnie Coleman . Big Ramy currently holds the title.

At 5\u00a0ft 10\u00a0ins and 240\u00a0lbs Oliva, nicknamed \"The Myth\", displayed an unforeseen level of muscle mass and definition, including a \"V\" shape of a large and a well-formed upper-body that tapered down to a narrow waist.

In the 1990s, the use of growth hormones by bodybuilders was reported, and they started to appear in competitions with an increasing physical size. Writing for Men's Health in 2016, journalist Lou Schuler questioned whether Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman competed \"naturally\" or used hormones. Yates retired from competitive bodybuilding after his 1997 victory, having accumulated several injuries. Ronnie Coleman, who placed 9th in 1997, surprised everyone with a much improved physique in 1998, winning the first of 8 consecutive titles.

        "content": "After being drafted by the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1990, Kuko\u010d continued to play in Europe, until finally reporting to the Bulls in 1993, when the team had just finished its first three-peat and had lost Michael Jordan to retirement. Although disappointed that he could not play with Jordan, Kuko\u010d made his NBA debut on November 5, 1993. The  Kuko\u010d came off the bench in 1993\u201394 behind small forward Scottie Pippen and power forward Horace Grant. On January 21, 1994, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, Reggie Miller made a mid-range jumper with 0.8 seconds remaining to give the Pacers a 95-93 lead. Scottie Pippen inbounded the ball to Kukoc, who hit a three-point jumper at the buzzer to give the Bulls the win, 96-95. Kuko\u010d put up a solid rookie season, averaging double-digit scoring and earning a berth on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. On May 13, 1994, at the end of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls and the New York Knicks were tied at 102 with 1.8 seconds left. Bulls coach Phil Jackson designed the last play for Kuko\u010d, with Scottie Pippen charged with inbounding the basketball. Pippen was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kuko\u010d did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, though the Bulls eventually lost the series in seven games. After Grant left in the offseason, Kuko\u010d moved into the starting lineup and finished the 1994\u201395 season second on the Bulls in scoring, rebounds and assists, behind Pippen. Furthermore, Michael Jordan would return to the Bulls in March, fulfilling Kuko\u010d's wish to play alongside him. For the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls were bolstered by both Jordan's return to full form and the offseason acquisition of exceptional rebounder Dennis Rodman. With Pippen still at small forward, coach Phil Jackson saw it best to have Kuko\u010d continue to be a bench player. Kuko\u010d was third on the team in scoring and was rewarded for his efforts with the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award. He also assisted the Bulls to a 25-game turnaround and the best record in league history at the time at 72\u201310 , as well as the fourth championship in team history. Kuko\u010d was the 4th and is currently the last player to win the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award and the NBA title in the same year having joined Kevin McHale, Bill Walton, and Bobby Jones in accomplishing that feat. In 1997 and 1998, Kuko\u010d again came off the bench as sixth man as the Bulls won their fifth and sixth NBA titles. Once again, he was the team's third-leading scorer."

Kuko\u010d was the highest-scoring player from the Bulls' previous season that remained with the team. In the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 season, he led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. During the 1999\u20132000 season as Chicago continued their rebuilding scheme, Kuko\u010d was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in a three-team deal involving the Golden State Warriors that sent Bruce Bowen, John Starks and a 2000 first-round pick to the Bulls. The following season, he was dealt to the Atlanta Hawks, along with Nazr Mohammed, Pepe S\u00e1nchez, and Theo Ratliff, in a blockbuster deal that sent Dikembe Mutombo and Roshown McLeod to the 76ers. After a short stint with the Hawks, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, along with Leon Smith, in a deal for Glenn Robinson. On September 12, 2006, Kuko\u010d announced that he would retire from professional basketball if he could not be signed by either the Milwaukee Bucks or the Chicago Bulls for the 2006\u201307 NBA season. Although various NBA teams had shown interest in his services, Kuko\u010d expressed a desire to be close to his residence in the city of Highland Park, Illinois."

West's father physically abused him, and West has stated that for a time he slept with a loaded shotgun under his bed out of fear that he might have to kill his father in self-defense. West was an outgoing and aggressive child in his youth. However, in 1951 his older brother, David, was killed in action in the Korean War, and the trauma turned West into a shy and introverted boy. He was so small, frail, and weak that he needed many vitamin injections from his doctor and was kept apart from children's sports, to prevent him from getting seriously injured. Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother's whippings when he came home hours late for dinner; he played so often that the NBA acknowledged it as \"obsessive\"."

He eventually chose to stay in his home state and attend West Virginia University , located in Morgantown. In his freshman year , West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 wins without a loss over the course of the season; other team members included Jay Jacobs and Willie Akers. In his first varsity year under head coach Fred Schaus, West scored 17.8\u00a0points per game and averaged 11.1\u00a0rebounds; he also started in all 28 games while shooting 49.6% from the field and 73.2% from the free throw line. These performances earned him a multitude of honors, among them an All-American Third Team call-up; First Team All-Southern Conference; Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player Award and First Team honors; Chuck Taylor\u2013Converse Second-team All-American honors; and Associated Press and United Press International Third-team All-American honors. The Mountaineers went 26\u20132 that year, ending the season with a loss to Manhattan College in postseason tournament play. During his junior year , West scored 26.6\u00a0 points per game and grabbed 12.3\u00a0 rebounds per game. He tied the NCAA five-game tournament record of 160\u00a0points and led all scorers and rebounders in every West Virginia game, including getting 28\u00a0points and 11\u00a0rebounds in a 71\u201370 loss to California in the final. West was named Most Outstanding Player of that year's Final Four. Further awards were All-American, Southern Conference Tournament MVP and Southern Conference Player of the Year and Athlete of the Year. He was also named to be a member of the U.S. Pan American Games basketball team that won the gold medal. West demonstrated his tenacity for the game in a match against the Kentucky Wildcats. He broke his nose during an incident in the game, but he continued to play despite intense pain and having to breathe through his mouth. He scored 19 points in the second half, leading WVU to an upset victory. In his final collegiate season West enjoyed several career highs, such as scoring 29.3\u00a0points per game, a 134 season-assists, 16.5\u00a0rebounds per game, and a shooting average of 50.4% from the field, 76.6% from the free throw line. He was honored again with several awards: a call-up to the All-American selection, and being voted Southern Conference MVP. West's best performance was a game against Virginia, in which he grabbed 16 rebounds and scored 40 points. Moreover, during that final year, he had 30 double-doubles and fifteen 30-point games. In his collegiate career, West totaled 2,309\u00a0points and 1,240\u00a0rebounds. He averaged 24.8\u00a0points per game and 13.3\u00a0rebounds. As of 2011, West holds 12 WVU all-time records. West and Oscar Robertson co-captained the U.S. men's basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics."

        "content": "West made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles. West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise. His college coach was also hired to coach the Lakers. He played West as a guard, in contrast to West's college days as a forward. The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley , Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard. This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell. Initially, West felt odd in his new environment. He was a loner. His high-pitched voice earned him the nickname \"Tweety Bird\", and he spoke with such a thick Appalachian accent that his teammates also referred to him as \"Zeke from Cabin Creek\" . However, West soon impressed his colleagues with his defensive hustle, with his vertical jump\u2014he could reach up 16\u00a0 inches above the rim when he went up\u2014and with his work ethic, spending countless extra hours working on his game. On the floor, West scored 17.6\u00a0points, grabbed 7.7\u00a0rebounds and gave 4.2\u00a0assists per game. West won Schaus's trust and, alternating with Hundley, Selvy, and Leonard, played 35 minutes per game and established himself as the Lakers' second scoring option. The NBA commented that the Lakers now had a potent one-two-punch\u2014with \"Mr. Inside\" and \"Mr. Outside\" . These performances soon earned West his first of fourteen NBA All-Star Game call-ups. West helped the Lakers improve from their previous 25-win season to 36 wins as they reached the 1961 NBA Playoffs. They needed all five games to put away the Detroit Pistons but then lost to the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, losing the final game 105\u2013103. In West's second NBA season, the Lakers could only make limited use of Baylor, who was called up by the U.S. Army Reserves and could play only 48 games. On January 17, 1962, West scored a career-high 63 points in a 129\u2013121 win over the New York Knicks. However, West seamlessly took over the role of team leader and established himself as the main Lakers scorer, averaging 30.8\u00a0 points, 7.9\u00a0 rebounds and 5.4\u00a0 assists per game, winning All-NBA First Team honors. West became known especially for hitting important late-game shots, and Lakers' announcer Chick Hearn named him \"Mr. Clutch\" a handle which stuck with West for his entire career. The Lakers won 54 regular-season games and secured a first-round bye in the 1962 NBA Playoffs. They beat the Pistons four games to two to advance to the 1962 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. The teams split the first two games, and at the end of Game 3 in Los Angeles, West tied the game at 115. The Celtics' Sam Jones inbounded the ball at half-court with three seconds left. West stole the ball, raced upcourt, and converted a running layup as the buzzer sounded. The Celtics tied the series in Game 6 at three games apiece, and the teams headed to Boston for Game 7. For most of the game, the Lakers trailed, but West and Frank Selvy hit several clutch baskets and tied the game at 100. Selvy then missed an open 8-foot shot which would have won the Lakers their first title. Baylor's tip-in attempt was thwarted by Sam Jones. In overtime, Jones scored several clutch baskets to ensure a 110\u2013107 win for the Celtics. The 1962 NBA finals would serve as the beginning of the greatest rivalry in NBA history In the 1962\u201363 NBA season, Baylor was back full-time. West averaged 27.8\u00a0 points, 7.0\u00a0 rebounds and 5.6\u00a0 assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team; however, he played in only 55 regular-season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury. Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3\u20132; then they succumbed in Game 6 in front of their home crowd with a 112\u2013109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena. In the following 1963\u201364 NBA season, West became the Lakers' scoring leader for the first time. His 28.7\u00a0 points per game eclipsed the 25.4 by Baylor, who stated that he suffered from knee problems. The Lakers struggled during the entire season, winning only 42 games, and were beaten  by the Hawks in five games during the first round of the 1964 NBA Playoffs."

        "content": "In the following 1964\u201365 NBA season, West averaged 31.0\u00a0 points , only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain. After ending the regular season with 49 wins, L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury. West spectacularly took over Baylor's leading role, as he scored 49\u00a0 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win. In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52\u00a0 points, nearly half of L.A.'s\u00a0 total, in the 118\u2013115 win. The Bullets took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48\u00a0 points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42\u00a0 points in a close 117\u2013115 win. West averaged 46.3\u00a0 points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record. However, in the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4\u20131. In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones kept West to the only 26\u00a0 points, and in Game 2, West scored 45\u00a0 points, but Boston still won 129\u2013123. In Game 3, West scored 49\u00a0points, and L.A. finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win. Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6\u00a0points per game. In the 1965\u201366 NBA season, West averaged a career-best 31.3\u00a0points, along with 7.1\u00a0rebounds and 6.1\u00a0assists per game.  He made an NBA record 840 free throws, and earned yet another pair of All-Star Team and All-NBA First Team nominations. Winning 45 games, the Lakers beat the St. Louis Hawks in a close seven-game series, and yet again met the Boston Celtics in the 1966 NBA Finals. West was assisted by Baylor, who was a self-estimated \"75 percent\" of his pre-injury self, The two long-standing rivals split the first six games, with West's usual scoring dominance countered by Celtics forward John Havlicek, whose size and speed created serious mismatch problems for the Lakers. In Game 7, West and Baylor shot a combined three of 18 in the first half, and the Lakers fell far behind; L.A. willed themselves back to a close 95\u201393 with four seconds left, but the Celtics ran the clock out and the Lakers were denied yet again. The 1966\u201367 NBA season saw West playing only 66 regular-season games due to injury; his averages fell slightly to 28.0\u00a0points, 5.9\u00a0rebounds and 6.8\u00a0assists per game. The Lakers had a disappointing season, winning only 36 games and getting swept by the San Francisco Warriors in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs. Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired, and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over; under his reign, the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967\u201368 NBA season in their first season in The Forum. The 52 wins were accumulated despite West playing only 51 regular season games due to injury and scoring 26.3\u00a0 points, the lowest average since his rookie year: after being a First-Teamer for six times en bloc, he only made the All-NBA Second Team. In the 1968 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls and the Warriors to set up yet another Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals; it was considered a match of size versus speed, as the Lakers had nobody to guard Celtics coach/center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket, but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor, West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich. In Game 1, West only hit seven of 24 shots, and the Lakers lost 107\u2013101, but L.A. evened out the series at two games each. But West, who had scored 38\u00a0 points in a Game 4 win, had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength the rest of the series. In Game 5, an injured West scored 35\u00a0points, but Boston won by three\u00a0points. In Game 6, Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40\u00a0 points, and after yet another Finals loss to Boston, West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won: \"We gave them the first game, and we gave them the fifth. But I take nothing from them... They're all that way on the Celtics, and you can't teach it.\""

        "title": "Jerry West_1968\u201371: Arrival of Wilt Chamberlain",
        "content": "On July 9, 1968, the Lakers made a trade that brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1968\u201369 NBA season. To get the center, the Lakers traded West's backcourt partner Archie Clark, starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia. Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark, and especially after losing Goodrich in the expansion draft to the Phoenix Suns. He only had diminutive, defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West. While West himself got on well with the recruit, Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff. Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain \"The Load\", and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as \"the dumbest and worst coach ever\". There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened. West was disturbed by locker room tension; used to playing on teams with good chemistry, his quality of play became erratic, and his scoring average of 25.9 points was his lowest since his rookie season. However, he made the Second Team of the inaugural All-Defensive Team. In the 1969 NBA Playoffs, the 55-win Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks and the San Francisco Warriors, setting up the sixth finals series versus Boston in eight years. Before Game 1, West privately complained to Bill Russell of exhaustion, but then the Lakers guard scored 53\u00a0 points on Boston in a close two-point win. L.A. also took Game 2, with West scoring 41\u00a0 points. In Game 3, Russell opted to double-team West, and the guard's exhaustion began to show: West twice asked to be subbed for longer periods, and both times the Lakers fell back by double digits and finally lost by six\u00a0points. Game 4 saw Celtics guard Sam Jones hit an off-balance buzzer beater to tie the series, but in Game 5, the Lakers struck back and won by 13\u00a0points; however, they suffered a major blow when West \u2013 who scored 39\u00a0points and by far led all players in scoring during the entire series \u2013 lunged for a meaningless late-game ball and seriously pulled his hamstring: it was immediately visible that the injury would not heal until the end of the series. A limping West scored 26\u00a0 points in Game 6, but the Celtics won 99\u201390 with a strong Bill Russell, who held Chamberlain to only eight\u00a0 points in the entire game. In Game 7, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles. This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics and angered West. The Lakers trailed the entire game and were behind 91-76 after 3 quarters, but powered by a limping West, the Lakers closed the gap to 103\u2013102 with two minutes to go and had the ball. But West committed costly turnovers and L.A. lost the game 108\u2013106 despite a triple-double of 42\u00a0 points, 13\u00a0 rebounds and 12\u00a0 assists from West, who became the only recipient of the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award from the losing team. After the loss West was seen as the ultimate tragic hero: after the game, Bill Russell held his hand, and John Havlicek said: \"I love you, Jerry\". In the 1969\u201370 NBA season under new coach Joe Mullaney, the Lakers' season began with a shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed practically the whole regular season. As after Baylor's injury years before, West stepped into the void, leading the NBA in scoring average with 31.2\u00a0 points per game, and averaging 4.6\u00a0 rebounds and 7.5\u00a0 assists per game, earning him his first of four All-Defensive First Team votes and another All-NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years. The Lakers won 46 games, and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs, they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four, setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks, led by Hall-of-Famers, such as Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games, with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still-hobbling Chamberlain. In Game 3, DeBusschere hit a mid-range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102\u2013100, and the Lakers had no time-outs left. Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West, who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60-foot shot. Frazier later commented: \"The man's crazy. He looks determined. He thinks it's going in!\" West incredibly connected, and this basket was later called one of the greatest moments ever by the NBA. As the three-point line had not been introduced yet, the shot just tied the game. In overtime, West, however, sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots, and the Knicks won 111\u2013108. In Game 4, the guard scored 37\u00a0 points and 18\u00a0 assists, and the Lakers won. However, more frustration awaited West in Game 5, when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed out for the series; instead of capitalizing on a double-digit lead and reeling off an easy win, the Lakers committed 19 second-half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half and lost 107\u2013100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. After Chamberlain scored 45\u00a0points and West 31\u00a0points plus 13\u00a0assists in a series-equalising 135-113 Lakers win, the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7. However, West had also injured his right hand and received several manual injections, and Reed famously hobbled up court before Game 7: the Knicks center scored the first four\u00a0 points, and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time. With his injured hands, West still hit nine of his 19 shots, but was outplayed by Walt Frazier, who scored 36\u00a0points and 19\u00a0assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett. In the 1970\u201371 NBA season, the Lakers resigned Gail Goodrich, who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. At age 32, West averaged 26.9\u00a0points, 4.6\u00a0rebounds and 9.5\u00a0assists, and helped the Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, West himself injured his knee and was out for the season; the short-handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship-bound Milwaukee Bucks, who were led by  freshly-crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson."

        "content": "Before the 1971\u201372 NBA season, West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement. The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall-of-Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach. Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career, the Lakers had a season for the ages. The team was powered by Sharman's emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense, and L.A. embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak, en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season. West himself contributed with 25.8\u00a0points and led the league with a career-high 9.7\u00a0assists per game. He was named All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All-Star Game MVP. In the postseason, the Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls in a four-game sweep, then went on to face the Milwaukee Bucks, and defeated them in six games. In the 1972 NBA Finals, the Lakers again met the New York Knicks. Although West suffered a terrible shooting slump during Games 1 and 2, the Lakers tied the series at one win each, and in Game 3, he scored 21\u00a0 points and helped L.A. win Game 3. In this game, he now had scored 4,002 playoff\u00a0 points, which set an all-time NBA record. After winning Game 4 due to a superb outing from Wilt Chamberlain, West scored 23\u00a0 points and dished out 9 assists in Game 5, helping the Lakes to win the game and the NBA championship. The championship was West's first-ever NBA title. West conceded that he had played a terrible series, and credited the team for the success. Years later he said \"I played terrible basketball in the Finals, and we won... It was particularly frustrating because I was playing so poorly that the team overcame me. Maybe that's what a team is all about.\" Having vanquished this long-time bane, West entered his 13th NBA year. In the 1972\u201373 NBA season, the main scoring role was taken by Goodrich, and West was now a playmaker instead of a scorer. However, West averaged 22.8\u00a0 points, but also averaged 8.8\u00a0 assists per game, and again was a First Teamer in the All-Star, All-NBA, and All-Defense Teams. The Lakers won 60 games and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. In-Game 1 West scored 24\u00a0 points before fouling out with three minutes left and L.A. won Game 1 115\u2013112. However, the Knicks took Games 2 and 3, and West strained both of his hamstrings: in Game 4, the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York, and in Game 5, the valiant, but injured West and Hairston had miserable games, and despite Chamberlain scoring 23\u00a0 points and grabbing 21\u00a0 rebounds, the Lakers lost 102\u201393 and the series. The 1973\u201374 NBA season was to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard averaged 20.3\u00a0points, 3.7\u00a0rebounds and 6.6\u00a0assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another call-up into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however, he said Cooke \"basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. When you feel that you're deceived you don't want any part of the organization that deceived you. I could've played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could've, and I knew I could've. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn't going to play for anybody else.\" At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any other Laker in franchise history."

NBA.com credits West in creating the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, also known as Showtime, which brought five championship rings to Los Angeles. Those championship-winning Lakers were coached by Pat Riley, and featured superstar players Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy. After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals. In 1995, West received his first Executive of the Year Award for his role in turning the Lakers around. West continued to propel the Lakers to championship contender status by trading Divac for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant , by signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal , and by signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach . West departed from the Lakers at the end of the 1999-2000 season. However, he laid down the foundation of the Lakers three-peat, which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000-2002. Memphis Grizzlies In 2002, West became the general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies. He explained his decision with the desire for exploring something new: \"After being a part of the Laker's success for so many years, I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success. I want to help make a difference.\" West's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, making few trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004. West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year. At age 69, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager in 2007 and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace, from Buckhannon, West Virginia. Golden State Warriors On May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber. This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team. In 2015, the Warriors won their first championship in 40 years; the championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive. He earned his eighth in the 2016-2017 season. Los Angeles Clippers On June 14, 2017, West announced that he would go to the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive board member."

He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as \"lightning quick\", and was known for making baskets late in the game, earning him the nickname \"Mr. Clutch\". Having played forward early in his career, West was also a capable rebounder, and gifted with long arms, quick hands, and strong defensive instincts, West was also once described as one of the best ballhawks, man-to-man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards: when the All-Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969, West made every one of them until his career ended in 1974. \"He stole more than anybody, although they didn't keep records on it then\", said Sharman. However, contemporaries were most impressed by West's work ethic, obsessively practicing and shooting and rarely being satisfied with himself. West's all-round game and attitude is maybe best expressed in his statistically most spectacular game: he once was credited with 44 points with 12 rebounds, 12\u00a0 assists, and 10 blocked shots, thus scoring a non-official ultra-rare quadruple double. Instead of being proud, West merely commented: \"Defensively, from a team standpoint, I didn't feel I played very well. Very rarely was I satisfied with how I played.\""

        "content": "West ended his playing career with 14 All-Star, 12 All-NBA Team and five All-Defensive Team selections, and scored 25,192\u00a0points, 6,238\u00a0assists and 5,366\u00a0rebounds in 932 games, translating to an average of 27.0\u00a0points, 6.7\u00a0assists and 5.8\u00a0rebounds per game. Among retired players, only Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain surpass his 27.0 points per game average. He led the Lakers in scoring in seven seasons, only Jordan had a higher career scoring average in the playoffs . In 1979, West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983. In March 2008, ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time. As a coach, West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns, and then went on to win seven NBA championships as a general manager, building the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players Magic Johnson, Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy and the 2000s under coach Phil Jackson and players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2000, the city of Morgantown, West Virginia, and West Virginia Governor Cecil Underwood, dedicated the road outside of the West Virginia University Coliseum, \"Jerry West Boulevard\". The same road is shared on the south end of Morgantown with Don Knotts Boulevard, in honor of another WVU alumnus. Also, on November 26, 2005, his number 44 became the first basketball number to be retired by West Virginia University and on February 17, 2007, a bronze statue created by sculptor Jamie Lester was installed outside of the WVU Coliseum. On February 17, 2011, a Jerry West statue was unveiled outside Staples Center at the Star Plaza in Los Angeles, California. Finally, the NBA logo itself is modeled after West's silhouette. On June 1, 2019, President Donald Trump announced West would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom."

        "content": "West married his college sweetheart Martha Jane Kane in April 1960 in Morgantown; they divorced in 1976. They have three sons, David, Mark and Michael. Jerry married his current wife Karen in 1978. They have two sons, Ryan and Jonnie. Jonnie played guard for West's college team, the West Virginia Mountaineers and married professional golfer Michelle Wie in 2019. As a person, West was often described as an introverted and nervous character, but who also drew the highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic. Regarding his shyness, WVU roommate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year, and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled two weeks when his guard never said a word. Apart from being shy, West was always restless: Schaus described him as a \"bundle of nerves\", Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as \"always on the move\", and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits, West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled. His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her. After a big loss, the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him, but West would say \"get out\" at the home porch and drive away\u2014an experience that \"killed\" her as a wife. Early in his career, West's West Virginian roots made him a target for some mild jeering. He spoke with a high pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West \"Tweety Bird\". His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach interrupted him and asked him to speak English. Baylor once commented: \"Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. You pass them on, but nobody can understand you.\" West was also regarded for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as \"obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win... a level of intensity so high it could melt lead\". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: \"He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out.\" Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a \"Jerry West Night\", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: \"Jerry, you are, in every sense of the word, truly a champion... If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy.\" In 2011, West and bestselling author Jonathan Coleman wrote a memoir entitled West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life. The book has had tremendous critical acclaim and became an instant  New York Times bestseller. During an interview on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, West revealed that as a child he was the victim of physical abuse from his father and has suffered from depression ever since."

        "content": "March 17, 1886: The Sporting News , founded in St. Louis  by Alfred H. Spink, a director of the St. Louis Browns baseball team, publishes its first edition. The weekly newspaper sells for 5 cents. Baseball, horse racing and professional wrestling received the most coverage in the first issue. Meanwhile, the sporting weeklies Clipper and Sporting Life were based in New York and Philadelphia. By World War I, TSN would be the only national baseball newspaper. 1901: The American League, another rival to baseball's National League, begins playing. TSN was a vocal supporter of the new league and its founder, Ban Johnson. Both parties advocated cleaning up the sport, in particular ridding it of liquor sales, gambling and assaults on umpires. 1903: TSN editor Arthur Flanner helps draft the National Agreement, a document that brought a truce between the AL and NL and helped bring about the modern World Series. 1904: New York photographer Charles Conlon begins taking portraits of major league players as they pass through the city's three ballparks: the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field. His images, many of which were featured in TSN, have become treasured symbols of baseball's past. 1914: Alfred Spink dies, and his son, J.G. Taylor Spink, takes over the paper. 1936: TSN names its first major league Sporting News Player of the Year Award, Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants. It is the oldest and most prestigious award given to the single player in MLB who had the most outstanding season. To this day, it remains voted on by MLB players. 1942: After decades of being intertwined with baseball, TSN adds in-season football coverage. 1946: TSN expands its football coverage with an eight-page tabloid publication titled The Quarterback. The tab is later renamed the All-Sports News as coverage of other sports is added, including professional and college basketball and hockey. 1962: J.G. Taylor Spink dies. His son C.C. Johnson Spink takes over the publication. In 1962, after Spink's death, the Baseball Writers' Association of America instituted the J. G. Taylor Spink Award as the highest award given to its members. Spink was also the first recipient. 1967: TSN publishes its first full-color photo, a cover image of Orioles star Frank Robinson. 1977: The Spink family sells TSN to Times Mirror in 1977. 1981: C.C. Johnson Spink sells TSN to Tribune Company. 1991: The Sporting News transitions to a glossy, full-color all-sports magazine. 1996: The Sporting News comes online, serving as a sports content provider for AOL. The following year, it launches sportingnews.com. 2000: Tribune Company sells TSN to Vulcan Inc., headed by tech billionaire Paul Allen. The following year, the company acquired the One on One Sports radio network, renaming it Sporting News Radio. 2002: The magazine drops the definite article from its name and becomes just Sporting News . Subsequent covers reflect the change. 2006: Vulcan sells SN to Advance Media, which places the publication under the supervision of American City Business Journals . 2007: Sporting News begins its move from St. Louis, where it had been based since its founding, to ACBJ's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. The publication leaves St. Louis for good in 2008, when it also became a bi-weekly publication."

In December 2012, after 126 years, Sporting News published its final issue as a print publication, and shifted to becoming a digital-only publication. The following March, ACBJ contributed Sporting News into a joint venture with the U.S. assets of sports data company Perform Group, known as Perform Sporting News Limited and doing business as Sporting News Media. Perform owned 65% of Sporting News Media. Sporting News would join Perform Group's other domestic properties, such as its video syndication unit ePlayer and its soccer website Goal.com. The deal excluded the magazine's Sporting News Yearbooks unit and NASCAR Illustrated.  Almost immediately after the venture was established, Sporting News laid off 13 staff writers. Perform Group acquired the remainder of Sporting News Media in 2015. Under Perform's ownership, Sporting News shifted to a more tabloid-like editorial direction. The site introduced a new logo and website design in 2016. Following Perform's acquisition of ACBJ's remaining stake, it began to align itself more closely with the company's other units, including replacing Associated Press articles with Perform's own Omnisport wire service for articles and video content .  Sporting News also began to introduce new localized versions in other markets, with a focus on countries where it had launched its sports streaming service DAZN. These sites are, in turn, used to promote the DAZN service. Perform Media president Juan Delgado explained that the company was trying to preserve the heritage of the Sporting News brand by still publishing original content, while also publishing content oriented towards social media to appeal to younger users."

The club is known as 'the Pilgrims' in reference to the Pilgrim Fathers, who left England and sailed to North America and settled near, though did not found, Boston, Massachusetts. The club's crest features the pilgrim fathers' ship, the Mayflower. The club's traditional colours are amber and black. They compete in Lincolnshire derby matches with Lincoln City, Scunthorpe United, Gainsborough Trinity and Grimsby Town. They play at The Jakemans Community Stadium. The club was formed in 1933 as a successor to the short lived Boston Town. They initially competed in the Midland League, before joining the Southern League for a four year spell in 1958. They returned to the Midland League and then joined then United Counties League, winning their first league title in 1965\u201366. Boston then switched to the West Midlands League, winning the Premier Division in 1966\u201367 and 1967\u201368, before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. United won four Northern Premier League titles in the 1970s and became founder members of Alliance Premier League in 1979. Boston returned to the Northern Premier League in 1993 and moved back to the Southern League Premier Division in 1998. Boston United won the Southern League in 1999\u20132000 and the Conference in 2001\u201302 to secure a place in the Football League for the first time under the stewardship of controversial manager Steve Evans. They spent five years in the fourth tier, but entered administration in 2007 and were relegated down two divisions into the Conference North. Demoted to the Northern Premier League the next year, Boston won the Northern Premier League Premier Division play-offs in 2010 and have since had four unsuccessful play-off campaigns in the Conference / National League North, including a 1-0 play-off final defeat to Altrincham during the last ever game to be held at York Street in August 2020."

They then had a moderate amount of success in various leagues, including the Midland League and Southern League.

The match against Tottenham Hotspur was played in front of a crowd of 46,185. The Pilgrims lost 4\u20130, but the match was more notable for the travelling support. Over 10,000 Boston supporters attended the game. A number of special train services from Boston to King's Cross were set up for the day. They were founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, of which they were champions four times, and of the Alliance Premier League in 1979. However, their Northern Premier League title wins were not enough to gain them election to the Football League, and when they won the title in 1978 they surprisingly missed out on league status in favour of runners-up Wigan Athletic, who took the Football League place previously held by Southport. In 1985 Boston United went to Wembley for the first and only time in their history for the FA Trophy Final of the 1984\u201385 season, after Bob Lee scored a winning last minute goal in the 2nd leg of the semi-final against Altrincham at York Street to put the Pilgrims through. Boston lost 2\u20131 to Wealdstone in front of 20,775, with Chris Cook scoring United's only goal. Boston United finished third in the Conference in 1988\u201389, but were unable to build on this and were relegated to the NPL in 1993. They were transferred to the Southern League, winning the title in 2000, and went fully professional in 2001. In their first season as a professional club, Boston won the Conference and were promoted to the Football League. However, in the wake of their promotion, Boston's manager, Steve Evans, and former chairman, Pat Malkinson, were charged with breaking the Football Association's rules over the registration of players. Both men received bans from the FA, and the club were fined and docked four points from their first season in the League. This angered some, especially the Conference runners up Dagenham & Redbridge, who believed that any points deduction should have applied to the previous season, which would have meant Dagenham being promoted instead. Youth team coach Neil Thompson was appointed as manager for Boston's maiden Football League season, and though they left it late to secure survival, they ultimately managed a creditable 15th place finish. The following season resulted in another relegation battle, and as soon as former manager Steve Evans had served his suspension in full, Thompson was sacked and Evans was reinstated as manager, leading them to a strong late-season run and an eventual finish of 11th. Evans' return and a substantial investment in the playing squad saw Boston among the promotion favourites for the 2004-05 season, but it in fact resulted in a disappointing 16th place. 2005-06 would prove to be their most successful Football League season, with their finish of 11th being their joint-highest, but the club missing out on the play-offs by just five points . The 2006-07 season saw Boston struggle all season long, however, and in May 2007, Boston were relegated from Football League Two on the last day of the season. Steve Evans and his assistant Paul Raynor on 27 May resigned from the club, and two days later joined Crawley Town. Because of the relegation Boston were originally scheduled to play the 2007\u201308 season in the Conference National but this position was immediately placed in doubt after the club's chairman Jim Rodwell entered Boston into a Company Voluntary Arrangement late in their last game so that 10 points would then be deducted in the 2006\u201307 season instead of the 2007\u201308 season. Although this meant that Boston started the 2007\u201308 season without a points penalty FA rules dictated that they be demoted 2 divisions as a result of HM Revenue & Customs placing a restriction into the CVA of Boston not being allowed to pay football creditors 100% of what they were owed. They therefore played the 2007\u201308 season in the Conference North division, two steps below the Football League. This would be United's first season under the new ownership of David Newton and Neil Kempster, who took control of the club over from ex-Chairman Jim Rodwell. Despite finishing the 2007\u201308 campaign in 10th place under the guidance of Tommy Taylor, United were still in administration by the 2nd Saturday of May in 2008. This meant they were relegated again to the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2008\u201309 season. Despite coming out of administration just before the start of the new season anyway, Boston United failed to have this decision overturned. Another result of this was that they would also have to enter the FA Cup in the 1st qualifying round, something which they had not done for many years. They reached the final of the Lincs Senior Shield but were swept aside by Stamford 4\u20131,and finished the league campaign in 16th position. A much more favourable campaign the following season saw The Pilgrims finish 3rd in the league where they won the play-offs, beating Bradford Park Avenue in the final thanks to an Anthony Church extra time winner to earn promotion back to the Conference North. Joint managers Rob Scott and Paul Hurst resigned from the club in 2011 and were appointed joint managers of Conference National side Grimsby Town. Club chairman David Newton revealed he was beginning legal proceedings against the pair and Grimsby Town, for breach of contract. The Pilgrims wasted no time appointing former Boston player Jason Lee and current player Lee Canoville as joint caretaker managers. With only 7 Conference North games remaining, the pair guided United to a 3rd-place finish in the league setting up a play-off tie against Guiseley. Boston lost the first leg 1\u20130 at Nethermoor Park but fought back in the return leg winning 3\u20132 at the Jakemans Stadium to take the match to extra-time and penalties. Boston went out losing 2\u20133. After a decent start to the 2012/13 season, Boston started to drop off the promotion pace, with a 7-game winless run from November to mid-December not aiding their cause. More inconsistency followed, and Jason Lee was sacked. Graham Drury took over within the same week but left the club after less than 2 months. Dennis Greene took over soon afterwards, but after a good start couldn't help the club from finishing higher than a poor 16th place, just 5 points above the relegation zone. The following season was a marked improvement in both league and cups. Whilst Boston fell at the 2nd hurdle at Brackley, they made the last 32 of the FA Trophy with wins over Redditch and Southport, before a 2\u20130 loss at Tamworth. In the league, they held on to a top 5 spot for most of the season and never fell below 8th, but they couldn't keep up with late surges by Hednesford and Guiseley, ending 1 place and 6 points off the playoffs in 6th. The following season Boston did make the play-offs however, securing a place with a 4\u20131 victory at Solihull Moors before a 0\u20130 draw at home to relegated Leamington was enough to secure third place. A 0\u20130 draw at Chorley's Victory Park set up a winner takes it all second leg at York St, and goals from Scott Garner and Kaine Felix put Boston 2\u20130 ahead. However, Chorley forced extra time with an overhead kick from Adam Roscoe late in injury time. Despite Roscoe's extra time red card, Boston failed to score a third and the game went to penalties, which United lost after seven spot kicks when Sam Ashton saved Rene Steer's penalty. Boston started the 2015\u201316 season as play-off favourites once again, but pressure mounted on Greene due to poor results including losing to Gainsborough in the FA Cup and Solihull Moors in the FA Trophy . However, Boston found spells of form later in the season to ensure 5th place at the expense of Nuneaton- although a 3-point deduction received by the Warwickshire side meant they finished below Boston . Boston faced North Ferriby United in the play-offs, and won the first leg 2\u20130 at home through Grant Roberts and Zak Mills' goals. The second leg at Church Farm was watched by approximately 2,000 travelling Pilgrims amongst the 2,500 spectators, but the home side were quickly celebrating as Liam King's penalty and Tom Denton's header quickly cancelled out Boston's lead. Danny Hone scored a third for Ferriby, which was ruled out for offside, but Wayne Brooksby won the tie for eventual promotion winners Ferriby as he scored while referee Andrew Miller ignored Nat Brown's head injury inflicted by Tom Denton's elbow. Somewhat of an exodus then occurred as Boston saw Spiess, Mills, Piergianni, Garner, Marrs, Felix and Southwell all depart, Southwell and Mills notably moving to league sides Wycombe and Grimsby respectively."

There were four sides to the stadium: the main seated Mick George Stand; the Co-Operative York Street Stand; the Spayne Road Terrace; and the old away end\u2014known as The Jakemans Stand and then turned into a home stand. The away fans sat in a section of the York Street Stand. Former club chairman Jon Sotnick claimed it was not up to Football League standards and called for a new ground during the Pilgrims' time in the Football League. Planning applications were made to Boston Borough Council in June 2006, but the council turned down the application. The ground had a total capacity of 6,643. The club built a new stadium outside the town, and on 10 April 2019 announced that the 2019-2020 season was to be their last at York Street. For the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season, the club were granted permission to use Gainsborough Trinity's Northolme as their home ground temporarily whilst finishing touches were applied to their new stadium. The club played its first game at the Boston Community Stadium on 5 December 2020, resulting in a 2-0 home defeat to Chorley in the National League North."

        "content": "On 4 December 2006 Boston's plan to relocate to a new stadium on The Boardsides was unanimously rejected by Boston Borough Council. This plunged the club's future into serious doubt. Chairman James Rodwell said the club's future was \"hanging in the balance\" because York Street did not have the facilities to allow the club to operate at a profit, and a ground move was required to wipe out the club's debts. Rodwell confirmed that he would be meeting with shareholders over the next couple of days to determine the best course of action, but did admit that the club's future was ultimately now in the hands of HM Revenue and Customs, who were owed a sizeable six-figure sum by the club. In a statement he released to the club's official website on 5 December he said: \"The club's financial situation at the present moment is dire. I would urge all supporters and anybody interested in the future of the football club, be that investors or potential purchasers, to come forward immediately\". In November 2006, Boston manager Steve Evans and his former chairman Pat Malkinson pleaded guilty to \"conspiring to cheat the public revenue between 1997 and 2002\". Both were given suspended jail sentences. In May 2007, Boston entered into a Company Voluntary Arrangement towards the end of their last game of the season when they knew they would be relegated to the Conference. This allowed them to avoid a points deduction in the next season, but has proved a controversial move. On 10 June 2007 the Football Conference's annual general meeting voted in favour of demoting Boston United to the Conference North, stating that the terms of the Company Voluntary Agreement which Boston entered was behind the decision. Altrincham were subsequently spared relegation for the second season running. Chief executive John Moules released this statement: \"Because Boston United are in breach of certain rules, it was felt Blue Square North was the best place for them. HM Revenue and Customs put a caveat on that CVA that Boston could not pay football creditors. That breaks Football Association, Football League and Football Conference rules and regulations. We're giving Boston the opportunity to re-establish themselves as a leading club outside the Football League. They believe the decision we have made is fair and just, and they are not going to appeal. We had meetings all day on Friday with Boston United and then informed Altrincham that they were staying up.\" On 4 July 2007, Chestnut Homes, a local housing development company, announced that they had acquired Boston United FC. In a statement at a press conference the new chairman David Newton said:  \"...\u00a0we are happy to sit here today and make certain pledges to the loyal supporters of the club. While we are involved in the club, the club will be whiter than white. While we are here, everyone will be paid. We will be prudent in the management of the club's finances. We will strive for excellence on and off the pitch. As finances permit, we will develop the youth side of the club, and if managed well that should pay dividends in the medium to long term for the club. Above all, we will try to rebuild the reputation of this football club.\" During the summer of 2007 Boston lost their entire squad except for Stewart Talbot and Paul Ellender, and new manager Tommy Taylor had to start from scratch. The team eventually finished mid-table but, taking everything into consideration, it was not a bad season. Nevertheless, at the end of the season it was announced Boston would be expelled from the Conference league structure after the club failed to exit administration by the 10 May deadline. The Conference is the only league in the world to have this appendix, which is not a rule as such, but only a guideline to be used at the League's discretion. The Pilgrims came out of administration before the end of the summer."

From the 2021\u201322 season, the club compete in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, after winning the League Two title. Nicknamed the \"Robins\", they have played at Whaddon Road since 1932. The club contests rivalries with Gloucester City and Forest Green Rovers. Founded in 1887, the club spent much of its early history competing in local football circles, before moving to the Birmingham Combination in 1932 and then the Southern League in 1935. They spent the next 50 years in the Southern League, winning the Midland Division in 1982\u201383 and then claiming the Premier Division title in 1984\u201385. They were subsequently promoted into the Alliance Premier League in 1985, where they remained for seven seasons until they were relegated in 1992. They finished as runners-up of the Southern League Premier Division for four of the next five seasons, and were promoted into the Conference in 1997. Under the stewardship of Steve Cotterill, Cheltenham won the 1998 FA Trophy final and then secured promotion into the Football League for the first time after winning the Conference title in 1998\u201399. He left the club after the 2001\u201302 season, having guided them to the FA Cup fifth round and promotion with victory in the 2002 Third Division play-off final. Immediately relegated after one season in the Second Division, they secured another promotion as manager John Ward guided them to victory in the 2006 League Two play-off final. Relegated after three seasons in the third tier, the club's 16-year stay in the Football League ended with relegation back to the National League in 2015. However manager Gary Johnson led Cheltenham to the Conference title with a 101 point tally in 2015\u201316, making them the first club in 26 years to secure an immediate return to the Football League as champions of the Conference. After Michael Duff took over from Johnson, he led the club to its first Football League title, winning the 2020\u201321 League Two title."

The appointment of Steve Cotterill as manager during the 1996\u201397 was the start of a period of success at the club which resulted in Cotterill being their most successful manager. Four months after taking charge he guided the club to runners-up spot in the Southern Football League Premier Division, but they won promotion to the Football Conference as champions Gresley Rovers were unable to meet the required ground capacity for Conference membership. In 1997\u201398, Cheltenham finished runners-up in the Conference and were close to champions Halifax Town until the end of April 1998. They secured a place at Wembley in the 1998 FA Trophy Final, beating Southport 1\u20130 in front of a crowd of 26,837 at Wembley Stadium. In 1998\u201399, Cheltenham secured the Conference title and entry to the Football League. Football League After two mid-table finishes in Division Three, Cheltenham finally won promotion to Division Two at the end of the 2001\u201302 season. Shortly after winning promotion, Cotterill left Cheltenham to join Stoke City as their manager. Cheltenham replaced Cotterill with first-team coach Graham Allner who had won the Conference championship with Kidderminster Harriers in 1994. Allner and assistant manager Mike Davis, who was originally assistant to Cotterill, were sacked in January 2003, after six months in the job, with Cheltenham near the foot of Division Two. Cheltenham turned to Bobby Gould, one of the most experienced managers in English football whose exploits include an FA Cup victory with Wimbledon in 1988. Cheltenham continued to struggle, and defeat in their final game of the season condemned the club to relegation back to Division Three after just one season. Gould resigned as Cheltenham Town manager in November 2003 and was replaced by John Ward. During the 2005\u201306 season, a new stand for visiting fans was added . They finished the season in 5th, earning a place in the play-offs. In the semi-final Cheltenham beat Wycombe Wanderers 2\u20131 away and drew 0\u20130 in the second leg at Whaddon Road. In the play-off final, Cheltenham beat Grimsby Town 1\u20130, securing a place in League One for 2006\u201307. The match at the Millennium Stadium on 28 May 2006 was attended by 29,196 people. Cheltenham started life in League One with a 1\u20130 win against Gillingham. Following Cheltenham's 3\u20130 defeat to Port Vale, manager John Ward announced he had agreed a four-year contract with League One side Carlisle United. A highlight of the season was winning twice against Leeds United. Cheltenham's survival was secured on the final day of the season as they beat Doncaster Rovers 2\u20131 at Whaddon Road, denying their opposition automatic promotion. Early in the 2008\u201309 season, Keith Downing left Cheltenham Town and was replaced by Martin Allen. Allen's team started poorly with a club-record seven defeats in a row, part of a 15-game run without a victory. The club narrowly avoided administration, and the 10-point penalty that would go with it, before Allen revealed that all the players at the club were up for sale. The season finished with Cheltenham's relegation back to League Two on the penultimate day of the season after three seasons in League One as they had conceded over 100 goals in all competitions. Cheltenham won their first match of the 2009\u201310 season against Grimsby Town 2\u20131, but fell dramatically down the table soon after. On 20 October, Martin Allen was put on gardening leave amid allegations he racially abused a nightclub bouncer, and assistant manager John Schofield took temporary charge. Allen was formally cleared of misconduct but still left the club by mutual consent in early December. Former Cheltenham captain and Kidderminster boss Mark Yates was appointed manager on 22 December 2009. Cheltenham continued to struggle through the rest of the season, only managing to avoid relegation on the final day of the season, although they finished four points ahead of the relegated sides. Yates, ahead of his first full season with Cheltenham, revamped the squad, releasing eight players, including defender Shane Duff, who had just completed his tenth year with the club. The season proved to be successful to begin with, with the Robins remaining close to the play-off positions, but they collapsed in the second half of the season and finished 17th, with only five wins in 26 games in 2011. Despite losing in the first round of the League Cup, they reached the Football League Trophy south quarter-finals and were handed a lucrative tie at Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup third round. Yates won the Manager of the Month award for November after three wins from three The Robins ended the season in 6th and defeated Torquay United 2\u20130 at home and then 1\u20132 away in the League 2 Play-off Semi-finals. The Play-off Final was contested at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, 27 May 2012. Crewe Alexandra defeated Cheltenham Town 2\u20130 with goals from Nick Powell and Byron Moore in front of a crowd of 24,029. The Robins also enjoyed a good run in the FA Cup, eventually losing out 5\u20131 to Premier League side Everton. On 6 November 2012, manager Mark Yates oversaw his 150th game in charge of the team in a 1\u20130 win against league leaders Gillingham. Cheltenham finished 5th, once again qualifying for the end of season play-offs after being pipped to the third promotion spot on the last day of the season by Rotherham United. The season included a run of 21 home league games without defeat. The play-offs saw Cheltenham face Northampton Town with Cheltenham losing both home and away games by 1\u20130. After finishing in the play-offs for two consecutive seasons, Cheltenham Town's 2013\u201314 season proved to be difficult. Any hopes of a third consecutive play-off place were ended by March. The highlight of the season was a trip to Premier League side West Ham United, with the club eventually losing 2\u20131 at Upton Park. Cheltenham finished the season in 17th place. On 25 November 2014, Mark Yates was sacked by Cheltenham Town after almost five years in charge. Cheltenham subsequently appointed Paul Buckle as team manager, but he was dismissed after just 79 days. In March 2015 Gary Johnson was appointed manager. In April 2015, after Bryan Jacob, a lifelong supporter, gave the club's supporters trust \u00a3222,000 in his will, members voted to use the money to accept a long-standing offer from the club for a permanent seat on its board of directors. Football fan Clive Gowing was subsequently elected. The club said it would also name a stand and supporters' player-of-the-season award in Jacob's memory. On 25 April 2015, Cheltenham Town lost at Whaddon Road to Shrewsbury Town, which meant that Cheltenham were relegated from the Football League after sixteen seasons. Return to the Football League After only one season outside of the Football League, Cheltenham secured an immediate return on 16 April 2016 with a 2\u20130 home win against FC Halifax Town. The team amassed 101 points, scoring the most and conceding the fewest goals, on their way to becoming Champions, finishing 12 points clear of second-placed local rivals Forest Green. January signing Dan Holman was joint winner of the National League's Golden Boot award, with 30 goals, having netted 16 times in just 18 games for the Robins. Danny Wright, a summer signing, finished the season with 22 league goals and 11 assists, winning the Supporters Player of the Year award. For the club's return to the Football League, manager Gary Johnson largely kept faith with the players that had won the previous year's National League. The 2016\u201317 season proved to be a struggle with a number of players finding the step up to League Two more difficult than had been hoped. The Whaddon Road pitch also came in for criticism, from both supporters and visiting managers, as it struggled to cope with its high levels of use . Results improved somewhat during the spring, although Johnson was absent on sick leave from March onwards while recovering from heart bypass surgery, leaving his assistant Russell Milton in charge. The Robins secured their league status with a 1\u20130 win over Hartlepool United in the penultimate game of the season. They finished the season in 21st place. During the close season a recovered Gary Johnson returned to work and signed a new two-year contract. He oversaw a major clearout of the squad with eleven players released. In the 2017\u201318 season the club ultimately only gained one point more than in the previous year , and finished in 17th place in League Two. By far the biggest success of an otherwise low-key year was Sudanese striker Mohamed Eisa. Signed as a free transfer from non-league football, Eisa scored 23 league goals for Cheltenham during the season and ultimately moved to Bristol City, for a transfer fee reportedly in excess of \u00a31m , in July 2018. At the end of the season, long-serving club chairman Paul Baker stood down from the role after 20 years, handing over the chairmanship to Andy Wilcox. On 10 September 2018, ex-Cheltenham player Michael Duff was appointed after the departure of Gary Johnson. Duff guided the Robins to 16th. The following 2019\u201320 season was very successful, narrowly missing out on automatic promotion in 4th place. Final league standings were decided on a points-per-game basis following disruption caused by the COVID\u201319 pandemic. Cheltenham missed out in the play-offs to Northampton Town, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate. In 2020\u201321, Cheltenham returned to League One as champions after five seasons in League Two. Due to the ongoing disruption caused by COVID-19, the vast majority of fixtures in 2020\u201321 took place behind closed doors. The Robins reached the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2006 before narrowly losing out to eventual 2020\u201321 Premier League champions Manchester City. Cheltenham were leading the match with ten minutes to play before eventually losing 3\u20131. Cheltenham guaranteed their return to League One with a 1\u20131 draw at home to Carlisle United. On 8 May 2021, Cheltenham won their first ever EFL title, beating Harrogate Town 4\u20131 on the final day to secure the League Two championship."

Traditionally, Cheltenham's main rivals were Gloucestershire neighbours Gloucester City. Due to Cheltenham's rise up the leagues, the last competitive meeting between the two sides was in 1997, meaning the rivalry is now of less significance but is still keenly discussed by both sets of fans. They also used to maintain a fierce rivalry with Hereford United. This rivalry is also now of less significance, however, due to United going out of business in 2014 and reforming as Hereford FC. The new club and Cheltenham are yet to meet in a competitive fixture. A survey conducted in August 2019 revealed that fans of The Robins also consider fellow West Country sides Bristol City, Bristol Rovers, Oxford United and Swindon Town as rivals."

        "content": "Leyton Orient Football Club is a professional football club based in Leyton in London, England, who compete in , the fourth tier of the English football league system. They are the second oldest football club in London to play at a professional level, and are known to their fans by their nickname \"the O's\". The club's home colours are all red. They have played home matches at Brisbane Road since 1937, having previously played at Millfields and Lea Bridge Road. Founded in 1881 as the Glyn Cricket Club, they began playing football as Orient in 1888 and joined the London League in 1896 after success in the Clapham & District League. The club adopted the name Clapton Orient two years later and were elected into the Football League in 1905. Relegated out of the Second Division in 1929, the club finally settled on the name Leyton Orient after World War II. They won the Third Division South title in 1955\u201356 and secured promotion out of the Second Division in 1961\u201362, though were relegated out of the First Division after just one season, and suffered a further relegation in 1966. That November the club's name reverted to Orient F.C. and they went on to win the Third Division under the stewardship of Jimmy Bloomfield in 1969\u201370. Orient spent the 1970s playing in the second tier, winning two London Challenge Cups and reaching the 1977 Anglo-Scottish Cup final and 1977\u201378 FA Cup semi-finals, before being relegated in 1982 and again in 1985. In 1987 the club reverted to being Leyton Orient again. They won promotion out of the Fourth Division via the play-offs in 1988\u201389, though were relegated again in 1995. Barry Hearn became chairman in 1995 after the club was put on sale for \u00a35 by then-chairman Tony Wood, a period covered by the television documentary Orient: Club for a Fiver . Orient gained promotion out of League Two with Martin Ling in 2005\u201306, before Hearn sold the club to Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti, who presided over two relegations in three years under 11 managers, taking the club out of the football league for the first time in 112 years. Nigel Travis took over running the club in 2017 and appointed Justin Edinburgh as manager, and under this stable leadership the club went on to reach the 2019 FA Trophy final and win promotion back into the Football League as champions of the National League in 2018\u201319."

        "title": "Leyton Orient F.C._History",
        "content": "Formation and name Leyton Orient were originally formed by members of the Glyn Cricket Club in 1881, many of whom were former students of the Independent College, Homerton in nearby Hackney ; an annual fixture is still held between the club and the college. The team has had several name changes since, first as Eagle Cricket Club in 1886, then as Orient Football Club in 1888. The 12 history books written on the club by its historian Neilson N. Kaufman between 1974 and 2015 suggest that the choice of the name Orient came about at the behest of a player, Jack R Dearing, who was an employee of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, later part of P&O \u2013 Peninsular & Oriental. The club's name was changed again to Clapton Orient in 1898 to represent the area of London in which they played, though there was another team called Clapton F.C. Before their relegation in 2017, the O's were the second-oldest league club in London behind Fulham and were the 24th oldest club currently playing in the Football League. Following Fulham's promotion to the Premier League they became the oldest London club playing in the Football League. They played in the Second Division of the Southern Federation's League in 1904, joined the Football League in 1905. By this time players such as part-time outside right, Herbert Kingaby could earn \u00a32 4s per week\u00a0\u2013 payment being somewhat sporadic. The name Leyton Orient was adopted following the conclusion of the Second World War. The club had moved to Leyton in 1937, though again there was another team called Leyton F.C. A further rename back simply to Orient took place in 1966 after the Borough of Leyton was absorbed into the London Borough of Waltham Forest. That renaming followed a financial crisis \u2013 one of several to hit the club and by no means the first or last \u2013 and restructuring of the company behind the club; this is remembered for a \"pass the bucket\" collection that took place at a special meeting of supporters in the East Stand, when complete closure was claimed to be a definite possibility. The club reverted to Leyton Orient in 1987, shortly after Tony Wood took over as chairman and at a time when a supporters' campaign was taking place in the Leyton Orientear fanzine to reinstate the Leyton part of the club's name. World War years The 1914\u201315 season was the last football season before the league was suspended due to the outbreak of the First World War. A total of 41 members of the Clapton Orient team and staff joined up into the 17th Battalion Middlesex Regiment , the highest of any football team in the country and the first to join up en masse.  At the final game of the season\u00a0\u2013 Clapton Orient vs Leicester Fosse, 20,000 people came out to support the team.  A farewell parade was also hosted but not before the O's had won 2\u20130. The British Film Institute holds a brief recording of this historic match and parade in its archives. During the Battle of the Somme, three players gave their lives for king and country: Richard McFadden, George Scott and William Jonas. Though they were the only Orient staff to have died during the First World War, many others sustained wounds, some more than once and were not able to resume their football careers after the war. Prior to the First World War, O's striker McFadden had saved the life of a boy who was drowning in the River Lea as well as rescuing a man from a burning building. History was made on Saturday 30 April 1921 when the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VIII, visited Millfields Road to see the O's play Notts County. The Orient won 3\u20130 and this was the first time a member of royalty had attended a Football League match. The royal visit was to show gratitude for Clapton Orient's patriotic example during the Great War and there is now a plaque erected on the site of the Millfields Road Stadium to commemorate this historic event. The story of the club's major involvement in the First World War has been told in a 2005 book entitled They Took The Lead, by Stephen Jenkins, deputy chairman of Leyton Orient Supporters' Club. In July 2006 Jenkins, assisted by Les Bailey, took a party of 150 Leyton Orient supporters and members of the Leyton and Manor Park Royal British Legion over to the Somme region of northern France, to visit World War I war graves and to pay their respects at the resting places of Richard McFadden, William Jonas and George Scott. This was the first official visit to the Orient war graves for 90\u00a0years. A second visit to the Somme took place the weekend of 12/13 July 2008, this time 183 O's supporters and members of the RBL made the historic pilgrimage. Chris Slegg, a BBC London reporter travelled with the party and footage of the Somme trip was shown on local news bulletins. In August 2009 Steve Jenkins, along with fellow O's supporter Theresa Burns and former Orient player Peter Kitchen, launched the O's Somme Memorial Fund with the objective of erecting a permanent memorial in northern France in honour of the Clapton Orient side that answered the call of king and country. A third trip to the Somme took place in July 2011 and the O's Memorial was unveiled in the village of Flers on Sunday 10 July. Later 20th century Leyton Orient were Division Three South champions in the 1955\u201356 season and spent 20 of the next 25 years in the Second Division, before being relegated at the end of the 1981\u201382 season. They have not been back to that level since. Orient's golden years were in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1961\u201362 season Orient were promoted to the top tier of English football, the First Division , for the only time in their history, after finishing second in Division Two under the management of Johnny Carey. The team struggled in the top flight and were relegated after just one season. Nonetheless, they did defeat local rivals West Ham United at home. They were Division Three champions in the 1969\u201370 season and spent the whole of the 1970s in Division Two. In 1972 Orient achieved one of the most famous results in their history\u00a0\u2013 coming back from 2\u20130 down to beat Chelsea 3\u20132 in the FA Cup fifth round. They were also Anglo-Scottish Cup Runners up in 1976\u201377. In 1978 Orient were defeated in the semi final of the FA Cup, the furthest they have progressed in that competition. In 1978 the club was indirectly responsible for the album Variations composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber for his brother, the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. This reached No.2 in the pop album charts. Variations came about as the result of a bet between the two brothers on the outcome of Orient's final game of the 1976\u201377 season against Hull City. In the 1980s Leyton Orient fared less well and after two relegations found themselves in the fourth tier of English football. However, they ended the decade on a high, as they were promoted in the 1988\u201389 season, when under manager Frank Clark they were promoted in the Division Four Play-Off Final after a 2\u20131 aggregate victory over Wrexham F.C. The early 1990s saw steady progress in the Third Division, missing out on a play-off place in the 1992\u201393 season on goal difference. However, the financial crisis at the club caused by then-chairman Tony Wood losing his business in the Rwandan Civil War led to a relegation back to the fourth tier, now renamed as the Third Division following the formation of the Premier League. Under manager Tommy Taylor, Orient were defeated in the 1999 and 2001 Third Division play-off finals, played at Wembley Stadium and the Millennium Stadium respectively. The latter final saw the fastest ever play-off final goal scored to date at the Millennium Stadium, as Orient's Chris Tate scored after just 27\u00a0seconds. Orient's fastest ever goal was scored after just 12\u00a0seconds by Lee Steele in a match against his former club Oxford at The Kassam Stadium on 28 March 2005. Promotion to League One After the 2001 play-off final defeat, Leyton Orient took several years to recover from their second play-off final defeat in three years. After Tommy Taylor left the club, Paul Brush spent two unsuccessful years in charge and after he was sacked, former player Martin Ling took over as manager in October 2003, with Orient second-bottom of the league. After several years of steady improvement, Leyton Orient gained promotion in the 2005\u201306 season, finishing in third place and gaining automatic promotion to League One. This was the club's first automatic promotion in 36\u00a0years and ended a period of 11 years in the English league's bottom division. This promotion season also saw an excellent FA Cup run, with Leyton Orient progressing to the fourth round after beating Premiership side Fulham. Promotion was only secured in the final minutes of the final game of the season, away at Oxford United; with the score tied at 2\u20132 and Orient seemingly destined to miss out yet again, news came through of a late goal scored against promotion rivals Grimsby Town F.C. that would potentially promote Orient. The Orient fans were still celebrating this when just 14\u00a0seconds later, Lee Steele scored to confirm Orient's promotion. The result also relegated Oxford to the Football Conference. Grimsby's manager that season was Russell Slade, who would later become Orient's manager. In 2006\u201307, Orient endured a difficult season in the third tier, having spent most of the season in or around the relegation zone and were bottom of the table at times during the first half of the season. An improvement in fortunes after Christmas\u00a0\u2013 including memorable wins against Millwall, Tranmere Rovers and a vital win at eventually-relegated Bradford City near the end of the season\u00a0\u2013 helped them finish in 20th place, one spot above the relegation zone. Most of the 2006 promotion-winning side left at the end of the season. Some players were released, some declined new contracts and the club's longest-serving player Matthew Lockwood was re-signed but later moved in pre-season to Nottingham Forest. 2007\u201308 was better, as Orient finished 14th with 60 points. The O's began the season in fine form, not dropping out of the top seven until after Christmas. However a loss of form in the second half of the season, recording only three wins from the last 12 games, meant the season ended in a respectable mid-table finish. Leyton Orient kicked off the 2008\u201309 season with a 2\u20131 win over Hereford United at home. Dean Beckwith put Hereford ahead before JJ Melligan and Adam Boyd gave Orient the win. Orient then continued the season with multiple poor results and performances throughout September and October and their only wins were away matches against Walsall and Southend United in the Football League Trophy first round. However Orient were knocked out of the trophy in the following round in an away match at Brighton & Hove Albion. They were in 22nd position in the League One table. Orient booked a place in the second round of the FA Cup after beating Colchester United 1\u20130. Two Goals from Jason Demetriou and Danny Granville in a 1\u20132 away victory against Bradford City put Orient through to the third round of the FA Cup where they played Sheffield United at home. They lost 4\u20131 and, after a run of bad form in the league, Orient parted company with manager Martin Ling and assistant Dean Smith. Youth team manager Kevin Nugent was named caretaker manager overseeing three games. On 5 February 2009 Geraint Williams was announced as manager until the end of the season. He enjoyed a very positive start, winning seven of his first nine matches and moving Orient up to 15th. After Geraint Williams' positive influence on the team they secured their League One status on 13 April with a 1\u20130 win over Swindon Town at the County Ground and eventually finished the season in 14th place. Orient had a proud day when they beat former Premier League runners-up Newcastle United 6\u20131 in a pre-season friendly match on 25 July 2009. By beating Colchester United away, in the first round of the Football League Cup, they earned a home second round fixture against Premier League Club, Stoke City. Continued success On 3 April 2010 Geraint Williams was sacked as manager after a 3\u20131 home defeat to fellow relegation strugglers Hartlepool following a poor run of form. Kevin Nugent once again took control for the 2\u20131 defeat at Southampton on 5 April and after the match Russell Slade was named as manager until the end of the season. With even less time to save Orient from relegation than Williams before him, Slade managed to bring about a change in form that saw Orient finish in 17th place, just one point but four places clear of relegation. In the summer of 2010 Slade's contract was extended for two years. After a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season, Orient's league form picked up towards Christmas, culminating in an 8\u20132 win against non-league Droylsden in an FA Cup second round replay. In a game described as \"the weirdest football match ever\", Orient had trailed most of the game 2\u20130 but scored six goals in extra time to progress into the third round. Orient then beat high-flying Championship side Norwich City 1\u20130 at Carrow Road to progress into the fourth round where they met another Championship side, Swansea City, at the Liberty Stadium. Orient beat Swansea 2\u20131 to set up a glamour fifth round tie against Premier League giants Arsenal at Brisbane Road, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw thanks to a late Jonathan T\u00e9hou\u00e9 equaliser for the O's. This set up a replay at the Emirates Stadium. Leyton Orient lost that replay 0\u20135, bringing to an end their longest run in the FA Cup since 1981\u201382. Either side of the Arsenal games, Leyton Orient achieved a club record-equalling 14\u00a0games unbeaten, putting the team just outside the play-off positions. However they were unable to maintain that momentum and ultimately missed out on the play-offs by just one point. The 2013\u201314 season saw more success for Orient, finishing third in the league and securing a place in the play-offs. They defeated Peterborough United to advance to the playoff final at Wembley, but lost in the final to Rotherham United via a penalty shoot-out. Sale, financial crisis and fall to Non-League The 2014\u201315 season saw a reversal of fortunes for Orient after the club was taken over by Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti. Long-standing manager Russell Slade left early in the season and was replaced by caretaker manager Kevin Nugent, followed in quick succession by Mauro Milanese and then Fabio Liverani before Christmas 2014. A disastrous second half of the season meant that Orient was relegated from League One after a 2\u20132 draw at Swindon Town on the final day. Liverani, with only eight wins in 27 matches, left the club by mutual consent on 13 May 2015. Orient finished one place but six points away from a League Two play-off place in the 2015\u201316 season. However, the following season saw another disastrous slump, under five different managers, as well as off-pitch turmoil, including a winding-up hearing against Becchetti for unpaid taxes. Another managerial departure saw Daniel Webb resign from the club, with assistant manager Omer Riza taking over first-team duties until the end of the season. On 22 April 2017, Orient were relegated to the National League after a 3\u20130 loss to Crewe Alexandra, ending  their 112-year stay in the Football League. Becchetti saw continued criticism for his ownership, which resulted in a pitch invasion and protest against him on 29 April, resulting in the game being called off. On 22 June, the club was officially sold to Nigel Travis, the chairman of Dunkin' Brands. Non-League and promotion back to League Two After a poor start to the season, manager Steve Davis, appointed at the start of the National League campaign, was sacked on 14 November 2017, and was replaced by Justin Edinburgh. Under Edinburgh the club fared better, and spent much of the 2018\u201319 season competing for promotion from the National League. However they were eliminated in the fourth round of qualifying for the 2018\u201319 FA Cup by Maidstone United. On 27 April 2019, following a 0\u20130 draw with Braintree Town, Orient secured promotion to League Two as champions of the National League after two years in non-league. The club also reached the final of the FA Trophy, but were defeated by AFC Fylde. On 3 June 2019, manager Justin Edinburgh was admitted to hospital following a cardiac arrest. He died five days later, aged 49. His assistant Ross Embleton was appointed as interim manager for the new season. Embleton was replaced by Carl Fletcher in October 2019 but Fletcher was sacked the following month after just five games in charge, and Embleton was reinstated as interim boss. Embleton was appointed permanently in January 2020 on a 12-month rolling contract.  Orient's first season back in League Two produced a 17th-place finish, with the final table ultimately being determined on a weighted points per game basis because of football's suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, the club furloughed all players and staff to reduce the financial burden on the club due to the pandemic."

As Orient was only a tenant and facing high rents and competition with other events at Millfields Road, Orient owners left Millfields Road for another racing ground across Hackney Marshes soon after, having stayed for 30 years.

Orient's first match held there was a 3\u20131 win over Newport County on 4 September 1930, in front of a crowd of 5,505. However, the ground was closed for repairs by order of the Football League after the directors of Torquay United complained that a wooden fence was too close to the touchline. Orient's next two home league fixtures were held at Wembley Stadium, the second attracting a crowd of just 1,916 to see the 3\u20131 win over Southend United. An FA Cup tie against Luton Town had to be held at Arsenal Stadium. The capacity of the stadium was 20,000 and although with improvements it could have been increased to 50,000, the Orient directors were never content with the ground. There were rumours of a move as far as Mitcham or a merger with short-lived neighbours Thames but a decision was made to move to Brisbane Road in time for the start of the 1937\u201338 season. The last Orient match to be held at Lea Bridge Road was another 3\u20131 victory over Southend United in front of a crowd of 2,541. The stadium was demolished in the 1970s."

        "title": "Leyton Orient F.C._Brisbane Road",
        "content": "Brisbane Road has undergone many changes since Orient's arrival. Previously known as Osborne Road and having been the home of Leyton F.C., it initially had only one stand on the east side that held 475 people and cover on the west side for standing. All of the standing was cinder banks. The East Stand was bought from Mitcham Greyhound Stadium in 1956 and eventually extended to cover the whole east side. The terraced enclosures at the front of the East Stand were replaced by seating in the late 1990s. Over the decades, the west side became a covered terrace and finally a seated-stand, while uncovered terracing was built at the north and south sides. As the ground's capacity was being progressively reduced through changes to ground safety regulations, Orient looked to redevelop Brisbane Road as an all-seater stadium to secure its future there. The initial plans, dubbed Orient 2000 by the club, were revealed in the mid-1990s. The plans were ambitious, as they involved rotating the pitch and developing all four sides. However, the club's near-bankruptcy and subsequent buy-out by Barry Hearn meant that a more realistic redevelopment plan was instigated. The first phase involved demolition of the South Terrace in the late 1990s and after delays while National Lottery funding was unsuccessfully sought the new South Stand was opened at the start of the 1999\u20132000 season. The next phase of redevelopment ran into financial problems. Notwithstanding that finance for the redevelopment had already been raised by selling off the four corners of the stadium for residential blocks of flats, an increase in costs meant that an emergency general meeting of the company was needed in April 2005. It was agreed that the club should sell a c.999-year lease on the West Stand for \u00a31.5\u00a0million to a consortium led by Barry Hearn Ltd or SBLL), with SBLL leasing back to the club on a same-length lease all of the stand except the office space for an annual rent of \u00a31. The additional funds generated by this complicated arrangement were used to complete the building of the West Stand. External completion of the West Stand was achieved in mid-2005 and the stand was opened for the 2005\u201306 season. The stand has a single lower tier of seating, while further up the structure are directors' and corporate hospitality boxes, club offices and player facilities, which were fitted out in summer 2007, prior to which the players continued to use the facilities in the East Stand. A second EGM was held in May 2006, where it was agreed to sell further land behind the North and South Stands to SBLL for \u00a31.25\u00a0million, the proceeds to be used to fund the building of the North Stand. The plan was to commence building the North Stand in July 2006 and for it to be open by Christmas 2006 but Waltham Forest council initially rejected the revised planning application for the stand and its adjoining additional flats. A revised application approved in early 2007 and construction began towards the end of the 2006\u201307 season. The stand\u00a0\u2013 which has become the Family Stand\u00a0\u2013 was completed before the 2007\u201308 season, giving the O's a four-sided ground once more, with a capacity of 9,271. The modernisation of the East Stand happened during the break between the season of 2013/14 and 2015/16. Black seats formed a pattern over the other red seats to spell out \"The O's\". During the 2008\u201309 season, Leyton Orient changed the name of the South Stand in honour of the late Orient top-scorer, Tommy Johnston and is known simply as the Tommy Johnston Stand."

Orient also expressed an interest in ground sharing the stadium with West Ham, but West Ham were not keen on the idea, and in December 2012 West Ham was chosen as the permanent tenant of the Olympic Stadium. Orient chairman Barry Hearn voiced his complaints over West Ham United being given an anchor tenancy at the stadium. Orient claimed that the stadium was too close to their own, which they claimed would breach FA rules and by extension, move the club into bankruptcy. On 6 March, Barry Hearn stated that he would mount another legal challenge as he believed that the rules set out by the LLDC had not been followed. Hearn also said that he felt that Leyton Orient's proposed ground share had been ignored and not properly explored. Orient's legal challenge was ended when a confidential agreement between Orient and the Premier League was reached."

Other local rivals include West Ham United, Millwall, Brentford, Dagenham & Redbridge, Colchester United and Barnet.  To a lesser extent and from a little further afield, Brighton & Hove Albion and Cambridge United are also considered rivals. Historic rivals include neighbours Leyton and two other disbanded/merged clubs, Leytonstone and Walthamstow Avenue.  The Dagenham & Redbridge rivalry continues the old rivalries with the latter two."

In April 2016 a smaller fans group known at the time as OTF arranged pitch protests against Hartlepool United, where the fans stormed the pitch and Colchester United where the game was abandoned after a pitch invasion with five minutes remaining which saw thousands enter the pitch effectively getting the game abandoned. although the remaining five minutes were eventually played three hours later behind closed doors, the protest brought much needed publicity to the club's plight, with worldwide news coverage. Notable fans include Bob Mills, Daniel Mays, Colin Matthews, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Andrew's brother Julian. The album Variations, which was famously used as the theme tune for London Weekend Television's South Bank Show, was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber as the result of his losing a bet to Julian Lloyd Webber on the result of a Leyton Orient match.

Playing point guard in the NBA, Kidd was a 10-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA First Team member, and a nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won an NBA championship in 2011 as a member of the Dallas Mavericks and was a two-time gold medal winner in the Olympics with the U.S. national team in 2000 and 2008. He was inducted as a player into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In October 2021, Kidd was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Kidd played college basketball for the California Golden Bears and was drafted second overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 1994 NBA draft. He was named co-NBA Rookie of the Year in his first season with the Mavericks, along with Grant Hill. Then, from 1996 to 2001, Kidd played for the Phoenix Suns and later for the New Jersey Nets from 2001 to 2008. He led the Nets to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances in 2002 and 2003. In the middle of the 2007\u201308 season, Kidd was traded back to Dallas. At age 38, Kidd won his only NBA championship when Dallas defeated Miami in the 2011 finals. He finished his playing career in 2013 with the New York Knicks. The following season, he became the head coach of the Nets, who had relocated from New Jersey to Brooklyn. After one season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, where he coached for four seasons until he was fired mid-season in 2018. Kidd's ability to pass and rebound made him a regular triple-double threat, and he retired ranked third all-time in the NBA for regular season triple-doubles with a career total of 107 and third in playoff triple-doubles with a career total of 11. He ranks second on the NBA all-time lists in career assists and steals and 12th in three-point field goals made."

As a youth, Kidd was highly scouted for AAU teams and tourneys, garnering various all-star and MVP awards. He attended the East Oakland Youth Development Center and frequented the city courts of Oakland, where he often found himself pitted against future NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton. At St. Joseph Notre Dame High School in Alameda, under the guidance of coach Frank LaPorte, Kidd led the Pilots to consecutive state championships, averaging 25 points, 10 assists, 7 rebounds and 7 steals his senior season. During that year, he also received a host of individual honors, including the Naismith Award as the nation's top high school player, and was named Player of the Year by PARADE and USA Today. The all-time prep leader in assists and the state's seventh-highest career scorer , Kidd was voted California Player of the Year for the second time and also a McDonald's All-American. On January 31, 2012, Kidd was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All Americans. After a highly publicized recruiting process, Kidd shocked many fans and pundits alike by choosing to attend the nearby University of California, Berkeley\u2014a school that was coming off a 10\u201318 season and had not won a conference title since 1960\u2014over a number of top-ranked collegiate programs including the University of Arizona, the University of Kentucky, the University of Kansas, and Ohio State University."

His 110 steals set an NCAA record for most steals by a freshman and set school record for most steals in a season, while his 220 assists that season was also a school record. His play was also a key factor in the resurgence of Cal basketball and helped the Golden Bears earn an NCAA Tournament bid, where they upset two-time defending national champion Duke in the second round of that tournament before losing to Kansas in the Sweet 16. Kidd continued his success as a sophomore, tallying averages of 16.7 points, 6.9 rebounds, 3.1 steals and 9.1 assists, breaking his previous school record for most assists in a season with 272, while also leading the nation in that category. He was also selected a First Team All-American, the first Cal player to be so named since 1968, as well as Pac-10 Player of the Year, becoming the first sophomore to receive that honor. The Golden Bears made the NCAA Tournament again as a fifth seed, but was upset in the first round by Dick Bennett's Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay team 61\u201357. Kidd was also named a finalist for both the Naismith and Wooden Awards as college basketball's top player and subsequently opted to enter the NBA draft in 1994.

        "content": "Dallas Mavericks Kidd was selected as the second pick overall by the Dallas Mavericks, behind Glenn Robinson of Purdue, and just ahead of Duke's Grant Hill. In his first year, he averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists, and led the NBA in triple doubles, sharing 1995 NBA Rookie of the Year honors with Hill of the Detroit Pistons. The year before the Mavericks drafted Kidd, they finished the season with the worst record in the NBA at 13\u201369. After Kidd's first season with the Mavericks, their record improved to 36\u201346 which, at 23 games, was the largest improvement in the NBA. In the following season Kidd was voted a starter in the 1996 All-Star Game. In his first two years with the Mavericks, the move most people associated him with was \"the baseball pass\". Kidd was a member of the \"Three J's\" in Dallas along with Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn. After promising beginnings, things turned sour among the trio. Mashburn's injury combined with deteriorated personal relations between the immature leaders of the team resulted in the Mavericks taking a step backwards instead of further development. Kidd's continued problems with the coaches affected the Mavericks' decision to trade their young star just in his third season in the league. Phoenix Suns Kidd was traded to the Phoenix Suns with Tony Dumas and Loren Meyer for Michael Finley, A. C. Green, and Sam Cassell during the 1996\u201397 season. In his first full season with the Suns in 1997\u201398, the team's win total improved by 16 games. The Suns, who finished the season with a 56\u201326 record, had been recognized for their fast-paced style of play with Kidd frequently leading a small lineup of four guards being on the floor at the same time together with Antonio McDyess playing at center. In the 1998\u201399 season, Kidd averaged 10.8 assists per game to dethrone Washington's Rod Strickland as the league's assists leader. He also led the NBA with seven triple-doubles and was second in the NBA with 41.2 minutes per game . Kidd averaged career highs in points , field goal percentage , rebounds and steals and was the only player to be ranked among the top 50 in the NBA in 10 different statistical categories. The Suns won all seven of the games in which he had triple-doubles. The Suns acquired Penny Hardaway from the Orlando Magic before the start of the 1999\u201300 season in hope of creating the best backcourt duo in the league. The combination of Kidd and Hardaway in the starting lineup was often labeled as the BackCourt 2000. Despite a decent 53\u201329 record, the Suns' season was spoiled by injuries to both of their superstars. Kidd, who broke his ankle late in the regular season, returned during the playoffs to help his team to beat the defending champion San Antonio Spurs and advance to the second round for the first time in his career. The 2000\u201301 season was affected by Kidd's personal problems as he was charged with domestic abuse of his wife. The Suns, who struggled in the middle part of the season, finished strongly with a 15\u20136 record to secure another 50-win season. Kidd took on more of the offensive load after his teammates encouraged him to be more selfish. He recorded 30-plus points six times on the year and five times in the last 19 games. In one particular hot stretch, he scored 36, 32 and 31 in three consecutive games in mid-March, prior to which he had never recorded consecutive 30-point games. During his stay in Phoenix, Kidd made the All-Star Game in 1998, 2000, and 2001 and led the NBA in assists for three consecutive years . It was also with the Suns that Kidd rose to the status of the league's best playmaker as he was voted to the All-NBA First Team three years in a row ."

Kidd joined the franchise as the team was constructed around a sophomore Kenyon Martin, veterans Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn, along with the rookies Richard Jefferson, Jason Collins, and Brandon Armstrong coming from the draft-day trade for the seventh pick Eddie Griffin. The 2001\u201302 season saw Kidd lead the Nets to a 52\u201330 finish, a 26-game improvement from the season before and the first 50-win season in the franchise's NBA history. He was voted to the All-NBA First Team and finished second to the Spurs' Tim Duncan in MVP voting. Many critics and fans have argued that Kidd deserved to win the award because of his impact in New Jersey\u2014transforming the Nets from perennial league doormats into championship contenders seemingly in the space of a single training camp. Under Kidd's guidance, the young Nets team prospered through the playoffs, won the Eastern Conference title and advanced to the franchise's first-ever appearance in the NBA Finals. Along the way they had some memorable moments including a double overtime victory against the Indiana Pacers in the decisive Game 5. Indiana's Reggie Miller forced the first overtime with a 35-foot three-pointer at the buzzer and the second one with a two-handed dunk, but the Nets eventually survived and beat Indiana 120\u2013109. Kidd scored 20 of his then playoffs-best 31 points in the fourth quarter and overtimes. After defeating the Charlotte Hornets 4\u20131 in the second round, the Nets then faced the Boston Celtics in the Conference Finals. In that series Kidd and the Nets experienced the biggest fourth quarter collapse in the playoffs' history, when the Celtics came back from a 21-point deficit to win the pivotal Game 3, taking a 2\u20131 series lead. However, the Nets then won three consecutive games, while Kidd averaged a triple double for the entire series. In the NBA Finals the Nets were swept in four games by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers."

The trade was retooled, with Trenton Hassell replacing George, and Keith Van Horn, who had agreed to come out of retirement, replacing Stackhouse, because NBA officials informed the Mavericks that if Stackhouse were to be included in the deal, he could not re-sign with the team if the Nets chose to buy out his contract. Antoine Wright was also added to the retooled trade proposal . On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Mavericks along with Allen and Wright for Van Horn , Harris, Diop, Hassell, Ager, $3\u00a0million, and first round picks in 2008 and 2010. The Mavericks hoped that Kidd would provide leadership to the team that for years had been labelled as weak mentally and help Dallas and its franchise-player Dirk Nowitzki to win their first ever NBA Championship. Although already a member of the Mavericks, Kidd started for the Eastern Conference in the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, as he had already been named as a starter prior to the trade. The Mavericks made a strong playoff push following the trade, but despite a 51\u201331 record, they were only able to secure the seventh seed in the highly competitive Western Conference. In the playoffs, they faced Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, and were eliminated in five games in the first round. The following 2008\u201309 season saw Kidd and the Mavericks stumble out to a rocky start, losing eight out of the first 15 games; however, the team finished the season strong to earn the sixth seed in the playoffs with a 50\u201332 record. Kidd finished the season ranked third in the league in steals with 2.0 per game, his best average in six years. In the playoffs, the Mavericks upset the San Antonio Spurs, with Kidd leading the team in assists in all but one game; the Mavericks reached the Conference Semifinals for the first time since 2006. Kidd's season ended there as the Mavs lost to the Denver Nuggets in five games. On July 5, 2009, Kidd verbally committed to re-signing with the Mavericks after being pursued heavily by the New York Knicks. The three-year deal reportedly was worth more than $25 million, all of it fully guaranteed. In the first year of Kidd's new contract in the 2009\u201310 season the Mavericks finished second in the Western Conference with a 55\u201327 record during the regular season. However, the season ended with another disappointment as the Mavericks lost in six games to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2010 NBA playoffs. It was rumored that Kidd had gone through a flu just before the series began which might have affected his physical conditions. He did not speak to reporters after Games 5 and 6 and skipped the team's final meeting."

Despite a mid-season injury to Dirk Nowitzki, and a season-ending surgery to their starting small forward Caron Butler, the 2010\u201311 season turned out to be the best for the Mavs in the Kidd's era as they finished the regular season with a 57\u201325 record.

After making a verbal commitment to re-sign with the Mavericks, Kidd changed his mind and decided to sign a 3-year deal with the Knicks. Kidd was expected to act as a mentor to Jeremy Lin but after Lin left to the Houston Rockets, it was assumed that Kidd would serve as a backup to Raymond Felton at the point guard position. During the preseason however, the Knicks head coach Mike Woodson decided to start the season with both playmakers in the starting lineup and Kidd adjusting more to the shooting guard role. With the new backcourt duo in the lineup, the Knicks opened the 2012\u201313 season with an 18\u20135 record while Kidd averaging 9.0 points per game on 44 percent three-point shooting in the first two months of the season. Nearly 40 years old, Kidd was asked to play almost 33 minutes per game in December. New York finished the season with 54 wins, an 18-game jump from the previous season. It was their first 50-win season since 1999\u20132000. The Knicks advanced to the second round of the playoffs, but lost to the Indiana Pacers in six games. Kidd struggled during the playoffs, when he was held without a field goal in his last 10 playoff games. It was believed that overworking Kidd during the regular season had strongly affected his performance in the second half of the season and left him burned out for the playoffs. Kidd retired on June 3, 2013, after one season with the Knicks and 19 seasons in the NBA. His announcement came two days after 1995 co-Rookie of the Year Grant Hill retired."

        "content": "Brooklyn Nets On June 12, 2013, Kidd was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets, replacing interim coach P. J. Carlesimo. He is the third person since the ABA\u2013NBA merger to debut as an NBA head coach the season after he retired as a player. In September 2013, Kidd bought a minority ownership stake in the team . On October 17, 2013, the Nets retired and raised his number 5 jersey to the rafters before a preseason game against the Miami Heat. Kidd was suspended for the first two games of the season after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor DWI charge stemming from an incident in July 2012. Joe Prunty served as acting head coach for the team's season opener in Cleveland and their home opener against Miami. He made his debut as head coach on November 3 in a loss to the Orlando Magic. On November 5, Kidd had his first victory as head coach in a 104\u201388 win over the Utah Jazz. On November 28, Kidd was fined $50,000 by the NBA for instructing his player Tyshawn Taylor to bump into him and intentionally spilling a cup of soda on the court in order to stop the game so his team could draw up a last-second offensive play against the Lakers. After a loss to the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day, the Nets dropped to a disappointing 9\u201319 record. Many critics started to question Kidd's ability to manage a group of veterans that included Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Joe Johnson and there even appeared rumours that Kidd might be on his way out before the end of the season. However, the Nets were able to turn things around at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44\u201338 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills. On February 3, 2014, Kidd was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for January. On April 1, 2014, he was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month a second time for March. He became the fourth coach overall to win both Player of the Month and Coach of the Month honors. He also became the second coach, after Jeff Hornacek of the Phoenix Suns, to win both honors with the same team. In the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, the Brooklyn Nets eliminated the Toronto Raptors in a 7-game series. Kidd is the 19th rookie head coach in the league's history to coach his team in a decisive Game 7 on the road, and became the first one to win it. In the semifinals, the Nets faced the Miami Heat and lost the series 4\u20131. Milwaukee Bucks On July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured Kidd's coaching rights from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2019. The move did not come without controversy, as it was reported that Kidd had been seeking more management power over the Nets' general manager Billy King and after being denied began talks with the Bucks even though they still had a coach under contract in Larry Drew. He later stated that he felt the Nets truly did not want him nor were they committed to building a contender. In his return to Brooklyn on November 19, 2014, he was greeted with heavy boos and jeers. The Bucks were one of the biggest surprises of the 2014\u201315 season. Under Kidd's guidance the young team improved from franchise-worst 15 wins in the previous season, finishing with a 41\u201341 record to advance to the playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee achieved that feat despite losing their 2nd draft pick overall Jabari Parker in December to a knee injury and trading star guard Brandon Knight to the Phoenix Suns in February. Kidd is the first coach in NBA history to lead two franchises to the playoffs in his first two years as a head coach. Kidd finished third in voting for the Coach of the Year Award behind Mike Budenholzer and Steve Kerr. The 2015\u201316 season was less successful for Kidd, as the Bucks finished with a 33\u201349 record and did not qualify to the playoffs. On December 20, 2015, it was reported that Kidd would be out indefinitely as he would undergo hip surgery on December 21. While Kidd was recovering, his assistant Joe Prunty was acting as an interim coach. On a positive note, Kidd moved rising 21-year old Giannis Antetokounmpo into a point guard position, which helped the young player to record five triple doubles in the season and make progress in most statistical categories. Despite the disappointing season, the Bucks owners issued Kidd a vote of confidence and mentioned a possible prolongation of his contract expiring after the next season. The following season Kidd led the Bucks to a winning record as they qualified to the playoffs for the second time in three years. Kidd had his projected starting unit available for just several minutes during the season. On February 9, the same day the shooting guard Khris Middleton was making his season debut after recovering from a hamstring injury, the power forward Jabari Parker went down with an ACL injury. Despite the setback, Kidd had the Bucks finishing the season strong with a 42\u201340 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the Toronto Raptors, the Bucks took a 2\u20131 lead after game 3, but went on to lose the series in six games. On January 22, 2018, the Bucks fired Kidd after the team posted a 23\u201322 record midway through the 2017\u201318 season. Los Angeles Lakers On July 31, 2019, Kidd was hired as an assistant coach by the Los Angeles Lakers. Kidd would go on to win his second NBA championship when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in 6 games in the 2020 NBA Finals. It was his first championship as an assistant coach. Dallas Mavericks On June 28, 2021, Kidd was hired as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks."

        "content": "In Game 3 of the second round of the 2007 playoffs, Kidd recorded his 11th postseason triple-double breaking a tie with Larry Bird for second place on the All-Time career list for postseason triple-doubles. On April 16, 2008, Kidd recorded his 100th career triple-double in the final regular season game with the Dallas Mavericks that year against the New Orleans Hornets. In the 2008\u201309 season, Kidd became just the fourth player in NBA history to reach the 10,000 assist milestone and is now the only player in NBA history with 15,000 points, 10,000 assists and 7,000 rebounds. Kidd is tied for the most turnovers in a game. He committed 14 turnovers against the New York Knicks on November 17, 2000, while playing for the Phoenix Suns. Kidd tied John Drew, who also turned the ball over 14 times in a game on March 1, 1978. On April 5, 2009, Kidd passed Magic Johnson for third on the all-time assist list in a 140\u2013116 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Kidd scored 19 points to go with a season high 20 assists, giving him a total of 10,142 career assists. On November 26, 2009, Kidd moved into 2nd place on the all-time assists list in a win against the Houston Rockets, surpassing Mark Jackson on the list. On November 12, 2010, Kidd dished out his 11,000th career assist on an alley-oop dunk to teammate Tyson Chandler. On January 12, 2011, Kidd hit his 1,720th three-point field goal, passing Dale Ellis for third place on the NBA career three-pointers made list. On February 20, 2012, Kidd collected his 2,515th career steal for second all-time in steals behind only John Stockton. On February 8, 2013, Kidd broke the 12,000 career assist mark as a New York Knick vs. the Minnesota Timberwolves in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He reached 12,000 on a pass to J. R. Smith for a three-pointer. The Knicks eventually won that game 100\u201394. In 2013, Kidd became the first player to win back-to-back NBA Sportsmanship Awards."

        "content": "Kidd's first participation in USA basketball came after his first season in college. He was the only freshman chosen to take part in Team USA's 10-member team. The team played five games in Europe and finished with a record of 3\u20132. Kidd tied for team highs in assists per game with 4.0, and steals per game with 1.4. He also had averages of 8.4 points per game, and 4.2 rebounds per game. Kidd's next stint with USA basketball came in 1999 where he participated in the USA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. The team finished with an undefeated record of 10\u20130 resulting in a gold medal and earning a berth at the 2000 Olympics. Kidd averaged 7.4 PPG, 6.8 APG, 4.4 RPG, 2.7 SPG and again led the team in APG and SPG. In 2000, Kidd was appointed as one of Team USA's tri-captains for the 2000 Olympics at Sydney. Kidd again led the team to an undefeated record of 8\u20130 which resulted in team USA winning the gold medal at the Olympic Games. Kidd had averages of 6.0 ppg, 5.3 rpg, and had team highs of 4.4 apg, and 1.1 spg. Kidd also had a FG% of 51.6 and shot 50 percent from three-point range. In November 2002, Kidd was selected to participate in the 2002 USA Basketball Men's World Championship Team. However, he had to withdraw from the team due to an injury. Kidd came back the next year and participated at the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico. Kidd again led the team to a record of 10\u20130, bringing home the gold medal and a berth at the 2004 Olympics. Kidd started all 10 games and had averages of 3.4 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 5.9 apg, and 1.2 spg. However, Jason Kidd again had to withdraw from the 2004 Olympic team due to another injury. In 2007, Kidd participated in the FIBA Americas Championship 2007. Kidd helped the team to a 10\u20130 record where he brought home another gold medal and a berth at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China. Kidd had averages of 1.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 4.6 apg, and 1.3 spg. He also shot 60% from the field and 62.5% from three-point distance. Kidd led the entire tournament with assist-to-turnover ratio of 9.20. With Kidd's help team USA averaged 116.7 ppg, and defeated their opponents by a margin of 39.5 ppg. In 2008, Kidd participated in the 2008 Olympics where the team yet again went undefeated in winning their first gold medal since the 2000 Olympics. The team, given the \"Redeem team\" moniker because of failures in the 2002 FIBA World Championship and 2004 Summer Olympics, were once again crowned to be the best team in world basketball. Overall, Kidd brought home five gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic qualifying tournaments, one from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and one from the 2008 Beijing Olympics."

His 107 career triple-doubles are fourth all-time, trailing Russell Westbrook, and Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Kidd finished his career with averages of 12.6 points, 8.7 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 1.9 steals in 1,391 regular season games. He impacted games with his accurate passes and by involving his teammates; scoring was not his focus. He is considered by many to be one of the best rebounding guards ever to play in the league, and ESPN called him \"one of the best passing and rebounding point guards in NBA history.\" Although Kidd was considered a poor outside shooter when he began his pro career, he retired ranked third all-time in the NBA in three-point field goals made. The New York Times called his improvement as a shooter \"perhaps Kidd's biggest, and most surprising, transformation\". He considered his NBA championship with Dallas and his two gold medals in the Olympics as tied for the top highlights of his career, followed by the co-Rookie of the Year he shared with Grant Hill."

As part of his plea, Kidd was ordered to attend anger management classes for six months. Kidd completed the mandatory counseling and continued to attend on his own. He and his wife were both active in their church and were thought to have completely reconciled. The incident, however, would be considered a catalyst for the Suns to trade Kidd to the Nets that year. On January 9, 2007, Kidd filed for divorce, citing \"extreme cruelty\" during their relationship. He contended intense jealousy, paranoia, and the threat of \"false domestic abuse claims\" to the police as reasons for the divorce. On February 15, 2007, Joumana Kidd filed a counterclaim for divorce, claiming that the NBA star\u2014among countless instances of abuse\u2014\"broke her rib and damaged her hearing by smashing her head into the console of a car\". The couple have three children. On September 10, 2011, Kidd married Porschla Coleman, a former model. On July 15, 2012, Kidd was arrested by Southampton Town police and charged with a misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated. According to police, around 2 a.m. Kidd's vehicle struck a telephone pole and ended up in the woods a few blocks away from his home."

He is the only male player to have completed a career Grand Slam in both singles and doubles, and the first of four male players to complete a double career Grand Slam in singles . His 28 major titles are the all-time record for a male player. He was ranked world No. 1 amateur in 1961 by Ned Potter, 1964 by Potter  and Lance Tingay, and 1965 by Tingay. Emerson was the first male player to win 12 singles majors. He held that record for 30 years until it was passed by Pete Sampras in 2000. He also held the record of six Australian Open men's singles titles until 2019 when Novak Djokovic won his seventh title. Emerson won five of those titles consecutively , a still-standing record. Emerson is one of only five tennis players ever to win multiple slam sets in two disciplines. Emerson was a member of a record eight Davis Cup\u2013winning teams between 1959 and 1967. Unlike several of his contemporaries, he chose to remain an amateur player and did not turn pro during the pre-Open Era."

        "content": "Emerson was born on a farm in Blackbutt, Queensland. His family later moved to Brisbane and he received better tennis instruction after attending Brisbane Grammar School and Ipswich Grammar School. Emerson won his first Grand Slam tournament doubles title in 1959 at Wimbledon . In 1961, he captured his first Grand Slam tournament singles title at the Australian Championships, beating compatriot Rod Laver in four sets in the final. Later that year, Emerson claimed his second major singles crown when he again beat Laver in the final of the US Championships. Known as \"Emmo\" on the tour, the six-foot right-hander was known for training hard and always being ready for strenuous matches because of his outstanding level of fitness. He was primarily a serve-and-volley style player, but was also able to adapt to the rigours of slow courts, allowing him to enjoy success on all surfaces. From 1963 to 1967, Emerson won five consecutive men's singles titles at the Australian Championships. His record of six Australian men's singles crowns was surpassed in 2019 by Novak Djokovic who won his record seventh. 1963 also saw Emerson capture his first French Championships singles title, beating Pierre Darmon in the final. Emerson's first Wimbledon singles title came in 1964, with a final victory over Fred Stolle. Emerson won 55 consecutive matches during 1964 and finished the year with 109 victories out of 115 matches. He won three of the year's four Grand Slam events that year . During his amateur career Emerson received several offers to turn professional, including an \u00a338,000 offer made at the end of 1964 by Jack Kramer, but declined and opted to remain an amateur. In 1966, Emerson rejected a $100,000 offer to turn pro, stating that he \"couldn't afford to take a pay cut.\" Emerson was the world No. 1 amateur player in 1964 and 1965 according to Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph and in 1961 and 1964 according to Ned Potter of World Tennis. In 1965, he successfully defended his Australian and Wimbledon singles crowns. He was the heavy favourite to win Wimbledon again in 1966, but during his fourth round match he skidded while chasing the ball and crashed into the umpire's stand, injuring his shoulder. He still finished the match, but was unable to win. Emerson's last major singles title came at the French Championships in 1967 \u2013 the year before the open era began. His 12 major singles titles stood as a men's record until 2000, when it was surpassed by Pete Sampras. Emerson signed a professional contract with the National Tennis League in early April 1968. Emerson had 10 straight victories in Grand Slam tournament finals in which he appeared, which is an all-time record. Emerson's final Grand Slam doubles title was won in 1971 at Wimbledon . His 16 Grand Slam doubles crowns were won with five different partners. From 1960 to 1965, he won six consecutive French Open men's doubles titles. Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and tennis great, writes in his 1979 autobiography that \"Emerson was the best doubles player of all the moderns, very possibly the best forehand court player of all time. He was so quick he could cover everything. He had the perfect doubles shot, a backhand that dipped over the net and came in at the server's feet as he moved to the net. Gene Mako and Johnny van Ryn could hit a shot like that sometimes, but never so often nor as proficiently as Emerson.\" Emerson was also a member of a record eight Davis Cup winning teams between 1959 and 1967. Emerson's 12 singles and 16 doubles titles make him one of the leading players in Grand Slam tournament history. Emerson's last top-20 ranking was in 1973, primarily owing to his winning his 105th and final career title at the Pacific Coast Championships in San Francisco. He defeated Roscoe Tanner, Arthur Ashe, and Bj\u00f6rn Borg in the last three rounds of that tournament. Emerson played just a few tournaments through 1977. His last appearance was in the Gstaad, Switzerland tournament in 1983. Although he exited the tournament circuit, Emerson did not retire. In the late 1970s, he served as a player/coach for the Boston Lobsters in World Team Tennis . He mostly played doubles with the Lobsters and often teamed with fellow Australian Tony Roche. In the 1978 season, the last season under the original iteration of World Team Tennis, Roy coached the Lobsters to the Eastern Division Championship and into the WTT Finals against the Los Angeles Strings. The final Lobster team that Emerson coached consisted of Tony Roche, Mike Estep , and Emerson himself as the male players. Emerson now resides in Newport Beach, California with his wife, Joy, and daughter, Heidi, and has a home in Gstaad where he holds a tennis clinic each summer. His son, Antony, was an All-American in tennis at Corona del Mar High School and the University of Southern California and played on the professional tour briefly. Roy and Antony won the United States Hard Court Father-and-Son title in 1978. Roy briefly coached promising juniors at East Lake Woodlands in Oldsmar, Florida."

In 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal, and in 2001 received the Centenary Medal. The Roy Emerson trophy, which is awarded to the male champion at the Brisbane International, is named in his honour. In 2009 Emerson was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame. He was honoured during the 2013 Australian Open at the Australian Open Legends' Lunch. In 2014, Brisbane named new courts in Milton at Frew Park after Roy Emerson.

        "content": "A linebacker is a playing position in gridiron football.  Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards behind the line of scrimmage and behind the defensive linemen.  They represent the \"middle ground\" of defenders, playing closer to the line of scrimmage than do the defensive backs , but farther back than do the defensive linemen. As such, linebackers play a hybrid role and are often the most versatile players on the defensive side of the ball; they can be asked to play roles similar to either a defensive lineman or a defensive back .  How a linebacker plays their position depends greatly on the defensive alignment, the philosophy of the coaching staff, and the particular play the offense may call. Within the linebacking corps, they are often divided into middle linebackers, sometimes called inside linebackers, and outside linebackers.  The middle linebacker, often called the \"Mike\", is frequently the \"quarterback of the defense\".  His central role on the field means he is in the best position to call defensive plays and direct shifts and changes based on what the offense is doing.  Outside linebackers are often in a unique position to blitz, a type of defensive maneuver where the player rushes unexpectedly into the offensive backfield in an attempt to disrupt a running play or sack the quarterback on passing plays.  Besides \"Mike\", other nicknames such as \"Sam\", \"Will\", or \"Jack\", among others, are commonly used to refer to various linebacking roles, to ease communication in play-calling. Historically, some of the most impactful defensive players, such as Pro Football Hall of Fame members Mike Singletary, Lawrence Taylor, Dick Butkus, and Ray Lewis, were linebackers."

        "content": "Before the advent of the two-platoon system with separate units for offense and defense, the player who was the team's center on offense was often, though not always, the team's linebacker on defense. Hence today one usually sees four defensive linemen to the offense's five or more. Most sources claim coach Fielding H. Yost and center Germany Schulz of the University of Michigan invented the position. Schulz was Yost's first linebacker in 1904 when he stood up from his usual position on the line. Yost was horrified at first, but came to see the wisdom in Schulz's innovation. William Dunn of Penn St. was another Western linebacker soon after Schulz. However, there are various historical claims tied to the linebacker position, including some before 1904. For example, Percy Given of Georgetown is another center with a claim to the title \"first linebacker,\" supposedly standing up behind the line well before Schulz in a game against Navy in 1902. Despite Given, most sources have the first linebacker in the South as Frank Juhan of Sewanee. In the East, Ernest Cozens of Penn was \"one of the first of the roving centers,\" another, archaic term for the position, supposedly coined by Hank Ketcham of Yale. Walter E. Bachman of Lafayette was said to be \"the developer of the \"roving center\" concept\". Edgar Garbisch of Army was credited with developing the \"roving center method\" of playing defensive football in 1921. In professional football, Cal Hubbard is credited with pioneering the linebacker position. He starred as a tackle and end, playing off the line in a style similar to that of a modern linebacker."

        "content": "The middle or inside linebacker , sometimes called the \"Mike\" or \"Mack\", is often referred to as the \"quarterback of the defense\". Often it is the middle linebacker who receives the defensive play calls from the sideline and relays that play to the rest of the team, and in the NFL he is usually the defensive player with the electronic sideline communicator. A jack-of-all-trades, the middle linebacker can be asked to blitz , cover, spy the quarterback, or even have a deep middle-of-the-field responsibility in the Tampa 2 defense. In standard defenses, middle linebackers commonly lead the team in tackles. The terms middle and inside linebacker are often used interchangeably; they are also used to distinguish between a single middle linebacker playing in a 4\u20133 defense, and two inside linebackers playing in a 3\u20134 defense. In a 3\u20134 defense, the larger, more run-stopping-oriented linebacker is usually still called \"Mike\", while the smaller, more pass protection/route coverage-oriented player is called \"Will\".  \"Mikes\" usually line up towards the strong side or on the side the offense is more likely to run on while \"Wills\" may line up on the other side or even a little farther back between the defensive line and the secondary."

Since the strong side of the offensive team is the side on which the tight end lines up, or whichever side contains the most personnel, the strongside linebacker usually lines up across from the tight end. Often the strongside linebacker will be called upon to tackle the running back on a play because the back will be following the tight end's block.  He is most often the strongest linebacker; at the least he possesses the ability to withstand, shed, and fight off blocks from a tight end or fullback blocking the backside of a pass play. The linebacker should also have strong safety abilities in pass situation to cover the tight end in man on man situations. He should also have considerable quickness to read and get into coverage in zone situations. The strongside linebacker is also commonly known as the left outside linebacker ."

He is also usually chasing the play from the backside, so the ability to maneuver through traffic is a necessity for the Will. The Will usually aligns off the line of scrimmage at the same depth as Mike. Because of his position on the weakside, the Will does not often have to face large interior linemen one on one unless one is pulling. In coverage, the Will often covers the back that attacks his side of the field first in man coverage, while covering the weak flat in Texas Loop or hooks/curl areas in zone coverage. The weakside linebacker is also commonly known as the right outside linebacker ."

The middle linebacker is designated \"Mike\" and two outside linebackers are designated \"Sam\" and \"Will\" according to how they line up against the offensive formation. If there is a strong call, the linebacker on the strongside is called \"Sam\", while the linebacker on the weakside is called \"Will\". The outside linebacker's job is to cover the end to make sure a run does not escape and to watch the pass and protect from it. The middle linebacker's job is to stop runs between the tackles and watch the entire field to see the play develop. On pass plays, the linebackers' responsibilities vary based upon whether a man or zone coverage is called. In zone coverage, the linebackers will generally drop into hook zones across the middle of the field. However, some zones will send the outside linebackers into the flats . In a man-to-man call, the \"Sam\" will often cover the tight end with help from a safety over the top, while at other times, the \"Sam\" and \"Will\" will be responsible for the first man out of the backfield on their side of the center, with the \"Mike\" covering if a second man exits on that side of the field. In the \"Tampa 2\" zone defense, the middle linebacker is required to drop quickly into a deep middle zone pass coverage thus requiring a quick player at this position."

The weakside inside linebacker is typically called the \"Will,\" while the strong side or middle inside linebacker is called the \"Mike\".  \"Sam\" is a common designation for strong outside linebacker, while the other position is usually called \"Jack\" and is often a hybrid DE/LB. Usually, teams that run a 3\u20134 defense look for college defensive ends that are too small to play the position in the pros and not quite fluid enough to play outside linebacker in a 4\u20133 defense as their \"Jack\" linebacker. The idea behind the 3\u20134 defense is to disguise where the fourth rusher will come from. Instead of the standard four down-linemen in the 4\u20133, only three players are clearly attacking nearly every play. A key for running this defense successfully is having a defensive front of three large defensive linemen who command constant double teams. In particular, the nose tackle, who plays over the offensive center, must be able to hold ground and to occupy several offensive blockers to allow the linebackers to make plays. The focus of the 3\u20134 defensive line is to occupy offensive linemen thus freeing the linebackers to tackle the running back or to rush the passer or otherwise drop into pass coverage. Generally, the primary responsibilities for both outside linebackers are to stop the run and rush the quarterback in passing situations, in which they line in front of the tackles like true defensive ends. The outside linebackers in a 3\u20134 defense are players who are very skilled at rushing the quarterback and they would be playing defensive end in a 4\u20133 defense. When it comes to the inside linebackers, one is generally a run-stuffing player who is better able to handle offensive linemen and stop running backs when the offense features a running play, while the other is often a smaller, faster player who excels in pass coverage. However, the smaller or cover LB should also be able to scrape and plug running lanes decently. The design concept of the 3\u20134 defense is to confuse the offensive line in their blocking assignments, particularly in pass blocking, and to create a more complex read for the quarterback. Many 3\u20134 defenses have the ability to quickly hybrid into a 4\u20133 on the field."

Thus, it appears as if there are four linebackers, but it is really three linebackers with one safety playing up with the other linebackers. Three of the defensive linemen are over both of the offensive guards and the center, thereby making it difficult to double team any one of the three interior defensive linemen. This can also take away the ability of the offense to pull the guards on a running play, because this would leave one of the defenders unblocked, or, at best, give another lineman a very difficult block to make on one of the defenders. The safety, like the linebacker, can blitz, play man-on-man, play zone, or drop back into deep coverage like a normal safety would do. The 46 is used in heavy run situations to stop the run, when a team wants to apply much pressure, or merely to confuse the quarterback and offensive line."

These line backers will be reading the offensive guard so they know what to do, so if the guard sets up to pass block the line backers know to get into their zone in order to cover the pass. If the guard come out for a run play they know that they need to fill the gap that they are supposed to so that they can make a play if it comes to them. Also, these inside line backers are often called on a blitz which is when no matter what the offense does, as soon as that ball is snapped they are shooting their gap and trying to get into the back field to make a play as fast as possible. Outside line backers sometimes are considered to be pass players before they are run players. But that depends on where they are lined up, if they are outside of the box of the defense then they will be pass first players, but if they play inside the box lined up behind the defensive end then they are typically a run player. One of the outside linebackers is usually called into either blitz or pass coverage to make up for the missing DB. In the NFL and college football, this alignment is used mainly in short yardage situations or near the goal line. It is commonly used in high school football."

        "content": "The tight end is a position in American football, arena football, and Canadian football, on the offense. The tight end is often a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver. Like offensive linemen, they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers. On the other hand, unlike offensive linemen, they are eligible receivers adept enough to warrant a defense's attention when running pass patterns. Because of the hybrid nature of the position, the tight end's role in any given offense depends on the tactical preferences and philosophy of the head coach as well as overall team dynamic. In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman, rarely going out for passes. Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations. Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time."

        "title": "Tight end_History",
        "content": "The advent of the tight end position is closely tied to the decline of the one-platoon system during the 1940s and '50s. Originally, a rule limited substitutions. Consequently, players had to be adept at playing on both sides of the ball, with most offensive linemen doubling as defensive linemen or linebackers, and receivers doubling as defensive backs. At that time, the receivers were known as either ends or flankers, with the end lining up wide at the line of scrimmage and the flanker positioned slightly behind the line usually on the opposite side of the field.As the transition from starters going \"both ways\" to dedicated offensive and defensive squads took place, players who did not fit the mold of the traditional positions began to fill niches. Those who were good pass catchers and blockers but mediocre on defense were no longer liabilities; instead, a position evolved to capitalize on their strengths. Many were too big to be receivers yet too small for offensive linemen. Innovative coaches such as Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns saw the potential of having a larger receiver lined up inside, developing blocking techniques and passing schemes that used the unique attributes of the tight end position. Greater use of the tight end as a receiver started in the 1960s with the emergence of stars Mike Ditka, Jackie Smith, and John Mackey. Until then most teams relied on the tight end's blocking as almost a sixth offensive lineman, rarely using them as receivers. In addition to superb blocking, Ditka offered great hands receiving and rugged running after a completion.  Over a 12-year career, he caught 427 passes for over 5,800 yards and 43 touchdowns. Mackey brought speed, with six of his nine touchdown catches in one season being breakaways over 50 yards.  Smith provided the position with a previously unheard of ability to catch long balls downfield, as shown by his career average of 16.5 yards per catch.  This leads all tight ends in the hall of fame and is even ahead of a significant number of HOF wide receivers. Starting in 1980 the Air Coryell offense debuted tight end Kellen Winslow running wide receiver-type routes. Tight ends prior to Winslow were primarily blockers lined up next to an offensive tackle and given short to medium drag routes. Winslow was put in motion to avoid being jammed at the line, lined up wide, or in the slot against a smaller cornerback. Former Chargers assistant coach Al Saunders said Winslow was \"a wide receiver in an offensive lineman's body.\" Back then, defenses would cover Winslow with either a strong safety or a linebacker, as zone defenses were less popular. Strong safeties in those times favored run defense over coverage speed. Providing another defender to help the strong safety opened up other holes. Winslow would line up unpredictably in any formation from a three point blocking stance to a two point receiver's stance, to being in motion like a flanker or offensive back. Head coach Jon Gruden referred to such multi-dimensional tight ends as \"jokers\", calling Winslow the first ever in the NFL. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick notes that the pass-catching tight ends that get paid the most are \"all direct descendants of Kellen Winslow\", and there are fewer tight ends now that can block on the line. In the 1990s, Shannon Sharpe's athletic prowess as a route-runner helped change the way tight ends were used by teams. Consistently double-covered as a receiver, he became the first tight end in NFL history to rack up over 10,000 career receiving yards. Tony Gonzalez and Antonio Gates, who both played basketball in college, pushed the position toward wide receiver speed and power forward basketball skills. At 6'6\" Rob Gronkowski brought height, setting single-season tight end records in 2011 with 17\u00a0touchdowns\u2014breaking Gates's and Vernon Davis's record of 13\u2014and 1,327 receiving yards, surpassing Winslow's record of 1,290. Jimmy Graham that season also passed Winslow with 1,310 yards. Six of the NFL's 15 players with the most receptions that year were tight ends, the most in NFL history. Previous seasons usually had at most one or two ranked in the top. While the timeline differs for individual each player, tight ends generally hit their peak between the ages of 25 and 30. A study conducted by Apex Fantasy Leagues concluded that about 69.1 percent of peak seasons fall within that range. In the Arena Football League the tight end serves as the 3rd offensive lineman . Although they are eligible receivers they rarely go out for passes and are usually only used for screen passes when they do. However, in Canadian football, tight ends are, in general, no longer used professionally in the CFL, but is still used at the college level in U Sports. Tony Gabriel is a former great tight end in Canadian football. There remain some tight ends in use at university level football; Antony Auclair, formerly a tight end for the Laval Rouge et Or, was a contender to be selected in the 2017 CFL Draft or possibly receive a tryout in the NFL. He was drafted by the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2017, but instead signed with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent that same year."

        "content": "Some plays are planned to take advantage of a tight end's eligibility . At times, the tight end will not be covered by the defense, a situation that rarely occurs with the regular receivers. The tight end is then considered another option for the quarterback to pass to when the wide receivers are covered. The tight end is usually faster than the linebackers who cover him and often stronger than the cornerbacks and safeties who try to tackle him. However, tight ends are typically chosen for their speed and catching ability and tend to have less blocking ability. Size does not affect catching ability. There could be tight ends on both sides of the line. At the extreme end of this spectrum are 'hybrid' tight ends that are drafted primarily for their pass-catching abilities.  Often, these players are talented athletes with near-receiver-like speed, coupled with the imposing physical size and strength of a traditional tight end.  Offensive schemes often seek to take advantage of this type of player by placing him in space, often treating him as an extra receiver.  Sometimes in a two-tight-end set, one tight end could be motioned out or audibled out to the slot."

        "content": "In the National Football League , the tight end is larger and slower than a wide receiver, and therefore able to block more effectively. It is the job of the tight end, along with the fullback, to open up a hole in the defense for the tailback to run through. Tight ends can also be used along with the offensive linemen to protect the quarterback during passing plays. Often, tight ends are employed in a fullback position called \"H-back\", lined up beside the tackle but slightly behind the line of scrimmage.  Specialty plays may even deploy 3- or 4-tight-end sets, with one or two in an H-back position, with one or fewer wide receivers to make the formations legal. Tight ends may also pass block like other offensive linemen. Some teams employ tight ends solely to block, however this position is sometimes filled by an offensive lineman who has reported to the referee that his number is now an eligible receiving number; this makes him \"Tackle Eligible\". Since the successful introduction of the West Coast Offense, most offenses use tight ends more as receivers than blockers. Traditionally tight ends were just blockers eligible to catch passes; however, now tight ends are more like bigger and slower receivers who can also block more effectively than most wide receivers. Most tight ends are generally large in size with an average height of 6'3\" and a weight exceeding 240\u00a0lbs . The origin of the two tight end set is unclear. The Detroit Lions and the Washington Commanders have been credited with being the first teams to use two tight ends as part of their base offense."

Bednarik began playing football in Bethlehem. He played for Bethlehem's Liberty High School. Following his graduation from high school, he entered the United States Army Air Forces and served as a B-24 waist gunner with the Eighth Air Force. Bednarik flew on 30 combat missions over Germany, for which he was awarded the Air Medal and four Oak Leaf Clusters, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and four Battle Stars. Bednarik subsequently attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he was a 60-minute man, excelling as both center and linebacker, as well as occasional punter.

        "content": "Bednarik was the first player drafted in the 1949 NFL Draft, by the Philadelphia Eagles, starring on both offense and defense . He was a member of the Eagles' NFL Championship teams in 1949 and 1960. In the final play of the 1960 NFL Championship Game, Bednarik, the last Eagle between Green Bay's Jim Taylor and the end zone, tackled Taylor at the Eagles' eight-yard line, and remained atop Taylor as the final seconds ticked off the clock, ensuring the Packers could not run another play and preserving a 17\u201313 Eagles victory. The controversy surrounding this play led to the NFL putting in a rule penalizing defensive players for not allowing an offensive player to get up off the field. In 1960, Bednarik knocked Frank Gifford of the New York Giants out of football for over 18 months, with one of the most famous tackles in NFL history. Bednarik was criticized after the game by Giants players and fans for apparently celebrating Gifford's injury and a picture from Sports Illustrated became iconic, showing Bednarik in mid-celebration, right above Gifford as he laid on the field, unconscious. Bednarik defended himself by saying that he was celebrating the fumble caused by the hit, which the Eagles recovered and was going to clinch the game for them, and the right to play for the NFL Championship. Years later, Gifford called the hit \"a clean shot\", and said, \"Chuck hit me exactly the way I would have hit him.\" Bednarik had a famous quarrel with Chuck Noll, who once, as a player for the Cleveland Browns, smashed him in the face during a fourth-down punting play. A few years later, Bednarik punched Noll in an on-field confrontation after a game, in retaliation. NFL commissioner Bert Bell fined Bednarik $500 and ordered him to apologize to Noll for the punch. According to Bednarik, when he gave the apology, Noll simply responded, \"Bullshit.\" Bednarik proved extremely durable, missing just three games in his 14 seasons. He was named All-Pro eight times and was the last of the NFL's \"Sixty-Minute Men,\" players who played both offense and defense on a regular basis. Bednarik's nickname, \"Concrete Charlie,\" originated from his off-season career as a concrete salesman for the Warner Company, not from his reputation as a ferocious tackler. Nonetheless, sportswriter Hugh Brown of The Evening Bulletin in Philadelphia, credited with bestowing the nickname, remarked that Bednarik \"is as hard as the concrete he sells.\" Bednarik served as an analyst on the HBO program Inside The NFL for its inaugural season in 1977\u201378. In 1999, he was ranked number 54 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.  This made him the highest-ranking player to have spent his entire career with the Eagles, the highest-ranking offensive center and the eighth-ranked linebacker in all of professional football. In 2010, Bednarik was ranked number 35 on the NFL Network's \"The Top 100: NFL's Greatest Players\". Ranked one spot ahead of Bednarik at #34 was Deion Sanders, a player for whom Bednarik has held open contempt in regards to being a two-way player. Bednarik was not the highest placed Eagle on the NFL Network's list. That distinction was held by Reggie White at number 7."

He attended reunions for the 25th anniversary of the 1960 NFL Championship team in 1985 and the 40th anniversary of the 1948\u201349 NFL Championship team in 1988 , held in pregame ceremonies at Veterans Stadium. Bednarik quarreled with current Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie in 1996. Lurie refused to buy 100 copies of Bednarik's new book for $15 each for the entire team, as that was against NFL rules, and that grudge carried over into the Eagles' Super Bowl appearance in 2005, when he openly rooted against his former team. He was a consistent critic of several league issues, including his pension, today's salaries, and one-way players. During Eagles training camp in the summer of 2006, Bednarik and the Eagles reconciled, seemingly ending the feud between Bednarik and Lurie. At the same time, however, Bednarik made disparaging remarks regarding Reggie White, leading to a somewhat lukewarm reception of the reconciliation by Eagles' fans. In the edition of August 4 of Allentown's Morning Call newspaper, however, it was reported that Bednarik apologized, stating he had been confused, and meant to make the statement about former Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens."

In the most critical lines of the King's Indian, White erects an imposing pawn centre with Nc3 followed by e4. Black stakes out its own claim to the centre with the Benoni-style ...c5, or ...e5.

The plans for both sides are roughly the same as in the main variation. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the early days of the system, Black would drive the bishop back with ...h6 and ...g5, though players subsequently switched to ideas involving ...Na6, ...Qe8 and ...Bd7, making White's c4\u2013c5 break more difficult, only then playing for kingside activity. Joe Gallagher has recommended the flexible 7...Na6 which has similar ideas to 7...a5. 7.Be3 is often known as the Gligoric System, after the World Championship Candidate Svetozar Gligori\u0107, who has contributed much to King's Indian theory and practice with both colours. More recently, other strong players such as Korchnoi, Anatoly Karpov, and Kasparov have played this line. The main idea behind this move is to avoid the theoretical lines that arise after 7.0-0 Nc6. This move allows White to maintain, for the moment, the tension in the centre. If Black plays mechanically with 7...Nc6, 8.d5 Ne7 9.Nd2! is a favourable setup, so Black most often responds by crossing their opponent's plans with 7...Ng4 8.Bg5 f6 9.Bh4 Nc6, but other moves are also seen, such as: 7...Na6 8.0-0 transposing into the modern. 7...h6 is a favourite of John Nunn. The main line runs 8.0-0 Ng4 9.Bc1 Nc6 10.d5 Ne7 11.Ne1 f5 12.Bxg4 fxg4. In this subvariation, Black's kingside play is of a different type than normal KID lines, as it lacks the standard pawn breaks, so they will now play g6\u2013g5 and Ng6\u2013f4, often investing material in a piece attack in the f-file against the white king, while White plays for the usual queenside breakthrough with c4\u2013c5. 7...exd4 immediately surrenders the centre, with a view to playing a quick c7\u2013c6 and d6\u2013d5. For example, 8.Nxd4 Re8 9.f3 c6 10.Qd2 10...d5 11.exd5 cxd5 12.0-0 Nc6 13.c5 and 13...Rxe3!? . In the Exchange Variation , White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in the relatively quiet positions which will ensue in this queenless middlegame. The line is often played by White players hoping for an early draw, but there is still a lot of play left in the position. White tries to exploit d6 with moves such as b4, c5, Nf3\u2013d2\u2013c4\u2013d6, etc., while Black will play to control the hole on d4. In practice, it is easier to exploit d4, and chances are balanced. If Black is able to play ...Nd4, they will often have at least an equal position, even when this involves the sacrifice of a pawn to eliminate White's dark-squared bishop."

        "content": "A minor but still significant sideline occurs for White on move 6, with 6.Bg5, the Zinnowitz Variation, instead of 6.Be2 e5. The line was played several times by German Grandmaster Burkhard Malich in the 1960s and 1970s. It is currently unfashionable at master level; Black gets a good game with either 6...h6 or 6...Nbd7. This line is distinct from the much more popular Averbakh Variation, described below, since in the Zinnowitz, White has played 5.Nf3 instead of 5.Be2, as in the Averbakh, and then follows with 6.Bg5. Another, more significant and quite popular sideline occurs for Black on move 6, with 6...Bg4, in place of the mainline 6...e5. One idea for Black here is to relieve their somewhat cramped position by exchanging their light-squared bishop, which is often relegated to a passive role in the King's Indian. White's most popular response is 7.Be3, similar to the Gligoric System ; White seems to retain a small edge in every variation. Top players who have used this line for Black include two former World Champions: GMs Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. After 6...c5 7.O-O cxd4 8.Nxd4 Nc6, the game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence."

        "content": "The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. It is named after Friedrich S\u00e4misch, who developed the system in the 1920s. This often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings, as in the Bagirov\u2013Gufeld game given below, though it may also give rise to heavyweight positional struggles. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 . This can transpose to the Modern Benoni after 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. World champions Mikhail Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov have all played this variation. This line defends the e4-pawn to create a secure centre and enables White to begin an attack kingside with Be3, Qd2, Bh6, g2\u2013g4 and h2\u2013h4. It allows placement of a bishop on e3 without allowing ...Ng4; however, its drawback is that it deprives the knight on g1 of its most natural square, thus impeding development of the kingside. Black can strike for the centre as previously mentioned or delay with 6...Nc6, 7...a6 and 8...Rb8 so that Black can play ...b7\u2013b5 to open lines on the queenside. The Classical Defence to the S\u00e4misch is 5...0-0 6.Be3 e5, when White has a choice between closing the centre with 7.d5, or maintaining the tension with 7.Nge2. Kasparov was a major proponent of this defence. The S\u00e4misch Gambit arises after 5...0-0 6.Be3 c5. This is a pawn sacrifice, and was once considered dubious. As Black's play has been worked out, this evaluation has changed, and the gambit now enjoys a good reputation. A practical drawback, however, is that a well-prepared but unambitious White player can often enter lines leading to a forced draw. The line where White accepts the gambit runs 5...0-0 6.Be3 c5 7.dxc5 dxc5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8 9.Bxc5 Nc6. Black's activity is believed to give sufficient compensation. White's most frequent play is to decline the gambit, and instead play 7.Nge2, and head for Benoni type positions after a d4\u2013d5 advance. However, after 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Nc6, the game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence. 5...0-0 6.Be3 Nc6 7.Nge2 a6 8.Qd2 Rb8 leads to the Panno Variation of the S\u00e4misch. Black prepares to respond appropriately depending on White's choice of plan. If White plays 0-0-0 and goes for a kingside attack, then 7...a6 prepares ...b7\u2013b5 with a counterattack against White's castled position. If instead White plays more cautiously, then Black challenges White's centre with ...e5."

Black often repels the bishop with ...h6 giving them the option of a later g5, though in practice this is a weakening move. White has various ways to develop, such as Qd2, Nf3, f4 or even h4. However, Black obtains good play against all of these development schemes. The old main line in this begins with 6...c5 . However, 6...Nbd7 and 6...Na6 are also seen. It is possible that the Averbakh System can transition to the Averbakh Variation of the King's Indian Defence."

This method of development is on completely different lines than other King's Indian variations. Here, Black's normal plan of attack can hardly succeed, as White's kingside is more solidly defended than in most KID variations. The most common responses are: 6...Nbd7 with 8...exd4.

He lost a match in England to Howard Staunton in 1846 at odds of a pawn and two moves, and drew a match with Adolf Anderssen in Germany in 1848. Harrwitz lived in England from 1849, and founded the British Chess Review. In 1856 he moved to Paris, where he won a match against Jules Arnous de Rivi\u00e8re. In 1858 he played a match against Paul Morphy in Paris. Harrwitz won the first two games, but lost the match 5\u00bd-2\u00bd. Harrwitz withdrew from the match, allegedly on grounds of ill health.

        "content": "A penalty in ice hockey is a punishment for an infringement of the rules. Most penalties are enforced by sending the offending player to a penalty box for a set number of minutes.  During the penalty the player may not participate in play. Penalties are called and enforced by the referee, or in some cases, the linesman. The offending team may not replace the player on the ice , leaving them short-handed as opposed to full strength. When the opposing team is said to be on a power play, they will have one more player on the ice than the short-handed team.  The short-handed team is said to be \"on the penalty kill\" until the penalty expires and the penalized player returns to play. While standards vary somewhat between leagues, most leagues recognize several common varieties of penalties, as well as common infractions. The statistic used to track penalties was traditionally called \"Penalty Infraction Minutes\" , although the alternate term \"penalty minutes\" has become common in recent years. It represents the total assessed length of penalties each player or team has accrued."

Two years later, the Montreal Gazette documented the first set of \"Montreal Rules\", which noted that \"charging from behind, tripping, collaring, kicking or shinning the ball shall not be allowed\".  The only penalty outlined by these rules was that play would be stopped, and a \"bully\" would take place. Revised rules in 1886 mandated that any player in violation of these rules would be given two warnings, but on a third offence would be removed from the game. It was not until 1904 that players were ruled off the ice for infractions.  At that time, a referee could assess a two-, three- or five-minute penalty, depending on the severity of the foul.  By 1914, all penalties were five minutes in length, reduced to three minutes two years later, and the offending player was given an additional fine. When the National Hockey League was founded in 1917, it mandated that a team could not substitute for any player who was assessed a penalty, thus requiring them to play shorthanded for the duration. The penalty was shortened to two minutes for the 1921\u201322 season, while five- and ten-minute penalties were added two years later."

        "content": "A minor penalty is the least severe type of penalty. A minor penalty is two minutes in length. The offending player is sent to the penalty box and in most cases, his team will play shorthanded.  If the offending player is the goaltender or a coach the team is given a \"bench minor\" penalty , then any skater who was on the ice at the time of the infraction may serve the penalty. In rare cases, when the offending player suffers an injury on the same play, whoever is on the ice at the time of the penalty may also serve the penalty, as was the case of Game 2 of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals' series during the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs, when Phil Kessel served a penalty in place of Tom K\u00fchnhackl. A team with a numerical advantage in players will go on a power play.  If they score a goal during this time, the penalty will end and the offending player may return to the ice. In hockey's formative years, teams were shorthanded for the entire length of a minor penalty.  The NHL changed this rule following the 1955\u201356 season where the Montreal Canadiens frequently scored multiple goals on one power play.  Most famous was a game on November 5, 1955, when Jean B\u00e9liveau scored three goals in 44 seconds, all on the same power play, in a 4\u20132 victory over the Boston Bruins. Coincidental minor penalties occur when an equal number of players from each team are given a minor penalty at the same time. The permission of a substitute player depends on the league and the situation at the time of the infractions.  In some leagues, such as the NHL, the teams will play four-on-four for the duration of the penalties if they occurred when both teams were at even strength.  However, if there is already a manpower differential, then both teams are allowed to make substitutions while the penalized players will remain in the penalty box until the first stoppage in play after their penalty expires.  In other competitions, such as IIHF events, coincidental penalties do not affect manpower in any situation. Coincidental minor penalties are not ended when a goal is scored by either team. In some cases, a referee can impose a double or triple minor. The infraction is counted as two or three separate minor penalties. If a team scores a power play goal during such a penalty, only the current block of two minutes being counted down is cancelled; the penalty clock is then reset to the next lowest interval of two minutes . Expiration rules of double- or triple-minor penalties due to goals being scored are identical to that of regular minor penalties being served back-to-back."

Most infractions which incur a major penalty are more severe instances of minor penalty infractions; one exception is fighting, which always draws a major. A player who receives a major penalty will remain off the ice for five minutes of play during which his team will be short-handed. A major penalty cannot end early even if a goal is scored against the short-handed team, unless the goal is scored during an overtime period . If major penalties are assessed to one player on each team at the same time, they may be substituted for, and teams will not be reduced by one player on the ice. The penalized players will remain in the penalty box until the first stoppage of play following the end of the penalties. This commonly occurs with majors for fighting. Starting with the 2019-20 season, NHL referees are required to use on-ice video review for all major penalties in order to either confirm the call or reduce the call to a minor penalty. Under IIHF rules, every major penalty carries an automatic game misconduct penalty; in other competitions, earning three major penalties in a game results in a game misconduct penalty, though a number of infractions that result in a major penalty automatically impose a game misconduct as well. Infractions that often call for a major penalty include spearing, fighting, butt-ending, charging, and boarding."

The player may be substituted for on the ice and may return to the ice at the first stoppage in play following the expiration of the penalty ; however, in practice, misconduct penalties are normally assessed along with two minute minor penalties . If an additional penalty is incurred with a misconduct penalty, the times run concurrently , with another eligible player serving the other penalty in the offender's place to enforce a disadvantage. For example, if a player receives a 2-minute minor plus a misconduct for boarding, two players will be sent to the penalty box: the offender and a teammate of his, frequently one who was on the ice at the time. The team is allowed to immediately substitute for the offender, so there is only a one-man disadvantage. Once the boarding penalty ends, the teammate can return to the ice, and both teams are at full strength again while the offender remains in the penalty box until the first stoppage in play after his/her ten minutes have elapsed. This is according to USA Hockey Rule 404and NHL Rule 28. In the event the other penalty is a major, most adult leagues allow deferring placing the substitute player into the penalty box so long as he is in place before the major penalty expires . In such cases, only a player from the penalty box can emerge in place of the offender after the end of the major penalty. Misconduct penalties are usually called to temporarily take a player off the ice and allow tempers to cool. They are sometimes also assessed in conjunction with fighting majors, giving the offending playerthe opportunity to calm down as they sit out their ten minutes. IIHF rules state that if the player gets another misconduct penalty, he risks a game misconduct penalty and is ejected."

The player may be immediately substituted for on the ice; however, in practice, game misconduct penalties are often assessed as an addition to a particularly egregious infraction that has also earned the player a two-minute minor penalty or a five-minute major penalty, in which case another player will serve this penalty in place of the ejected player. Regardless of the time during the game that the penalty is given, the player is charged with ten penalty minutes for statistical purposes for the game misconduct. This rule also applies to match penalties . In most leagues, the referee has the discretion to call a game misconduct on a player charged with boarding due to the likelihood of injury to the boarded player.  However, in the NHL, if a boarded player suffers a head or facial injury , the offending player receives an automatic game misconduct. Any player who is dismissed twice for stick infractions, boarding or checking from behind, or dismissed three times for any reason, in a single NHL regular season incurs an automatic one-match ban, and further discipline is possible for subsequent ejections. For each subsequent game misconduct penalty, the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game. Salary lost as a result of a ban is usually donated to a league-supported charity or to a program to assist retired players. Examples of a game misconduct penalty include getting out of the penalty box before the penalty time is served, trying to join or attempt to break up a fight [third man in] or earning a second misconduct penalty in the same game."

Many other penalties automatically become match penalties if injuries actually occur: under NHL rules, butt-ending, goalies using blocking glove to the face of another player, head-butting, kicking, punching an unsuspecting player, spearing, and tape on hands during altercation must be called as a match penalty if injuries occur; under IIHF rules, kneeing and checking to the head or neck area must be called as a match penalty if injuries occur. NHL referees are required to use on-ice video review for all match penalties in order to either confirm the call or reduce the call to a minor penalty. The team of the offending player must choose a substitute player to place in the box from any of the eligible players, excluding the goaltender. The substitute serves a five-minute penalty similar to a major penalty . If the goaltender receives a match penalty, another player serves the time so that the team may immediately insert a backup. In most cases, offending players are suspended from the next game their team plays, and often face hearings with the possibility of a lengthier ban. In the NHL, a match penalty and a game misconduct are virtually identical in application. However, a match penalty carries a larger fine, and the offending player is suspended indefinitely until the Commissioner rules on the issue. In NCAA hockey, a similar penalty called a game disqualification results in automatic suspension for the number of games equal to the number of game disqualification penalties the player has been assessed in that season.

It was imposed for an action of extreme unsportsmanlike conduct, such as abuse of officials or spectators, and could be assessed to any team official in addition to a player. Infractions which garnered a gross misconduct now earn a game misconduct. The penalty had last been assessed in 2006 on Atlanta Thrashers coach Bob Hartley due to post-game comments made regarding referee Mick McGeough's blown call during a game versus Edmonton.  The Phoenix Coyotes' Shane Doan was the last player to be given a gross misconduct penalty in 2005 for alleged ethnic slurs directed at French-Canadian referees . However, this penalty is still in effect in Canadian hockey. \"A Gross Misconduct penalty shall be assessed [to] any player or team official who conducts herself in such a manner as to make a travesty of the game.\" This penalty can be assessed for actions which include the consumption of alcohol prior or during the game. Where a player or team official becomes involved in a fight with a team official or spectator. Any player or team official who sprays water on or at an official Any player or team official who engages in verbal taunts based on discriminatory grounds Enforcement of penalties The referees make most penalty calls. Linesmen may stop play and enforce only certain infractions , such as \"too many players on the ice\". The official will initially put an arm in the air to signal a penalty; the official will stop play only once the offending team has control of the puck, or play is stopped by normal means. A delayed penalty is one in which the penalty is called but play is not yet stopped because the non-offending team retains the puck. Because the play will stop immediately upon the offending team gaining control of the puck, the goaltender of the non-offending team will often go to the players' bench upon seeing the arm signal to allow an extra attacker on the ice until the play is stopped. Because the offending team will not be able to take a shot on goal before the play is stopped, this is generally seen as a risk-free play. However, there have been instances in which the non-offending team accidentally puts the puck into their own net, usually on a failed backwards pass. Once the offending team touches the puck and the play is stopped, the referee will signal the specific infraction. In the NHL, if the non-offending team scores a goal in a delayed penalty situation, then it is treated as if a goal was scored during that penalty. Thus, if the delayed penalty is a minor, the penalty is waved off. If the delayed penalty is a double-minor, only the first two-minute block is waved off, and the offending player must still serve the second time block. These rules used to be in college hockey as well, until the 2010-2011 season, when it was changed so that the penalty would still be imposed even if a goal was scored.  Major penalties, misconduct penalties and match penalties, which are not affected by goals, are enforced in the usual manner, in both college hockey and the NHL, whether or not a goal is scored. The offending player or players are sent to the penalty box where they must remain until the penalty has expired. Typically a team will not be allowed to replace the penalized player on the ice; the player will return directly to the ice once the penalty has expired. This creates a power play during which the penalized team will have one player fewer than their opponent and is said to be \"short-handed\". If two players on a team are in the penalty box at the same time, the situation is called a \"five on three\" or \"two-man advantage\". Additional players may be penalized, but a team will never play with fewer than three skaters on the ice. Additional penalties will be delayed until one of the earlier penalties has expired . In leagues which play with a shorthanded overtime , should a team be penalized with only three players on the ice, the penalized player may be immediately substituted by the offending team, but an additional skater is then allowed on the other team to create an advantage, until a five-on-three is produced.  If a penalty in this situation expires without a goal being scored, the penalized player will be allowed back on the ice and will play normally until there is a stoppage; both teams will then be reduced back to the correct numbers. Ending coincidental penalties produce a similar situation, with both teams playing with additional players until play is stopped, allowing teams to be reduced again. While goaltenders can be assessed penalties, a goaltender cannot go to the penalty box and the penalty must be instead served by another player from their team who was on the ice at the time of the infraction . If the goaltender receives either three major penalties , one game misconduct penalty , or one match penalty however, he or she is ejected for the remainder of the game and must be substituted. While a team is short-handed, they are permitted to ice the puck as they wish, without having the icing infraction called against them. This allows short-handed teams to relieve pressure more easily when defending with fewer skaters than their opponents. This exemption does not apply to teams whose opponents have pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker ."

        "content": "A team must have a minimum of three skaters on the ice at all times. If an accumulation of penalties would otherwise force a team to fall below this minimum, the situation becomes known as \"stacked penalties\". This means that the new penalty will start when one of the already-penalized players causing the disadvantage is allowed back onto the ice, whether the time expires or the opposing team scores on the power play. This also means that the player whose penalty expires first out of the three must wait for a stoppage in play, or the expiration of the second penalty, before leaving the penalty box so that it is appropriately 5 on 3, 5 on 4, and 5 on 5 in succession for each respective situation. Penalties that allow for immediate substitution do not produce a disadvantage and thus do not count for stacked penalties. Stacked penalties still apply in shorthanded overtimes because two penalties still result in a five-on-three situation regardless of the initial lineup due to the rules allowing an extra attacker as needed."

        "content": "Abuse of officials  Arguing with, insulting, using obscene gestures or language directed at or in reference to, or deliberately making violent contact with any on or off-ice official. This generally is issued in addition to other penalties or as a bench penalty against a coach or off-ice player, and is grounds for ejection under a game misconduct or match penalty in most leagues including the NHL. Aggressor penalty  Assessed to a player who engages in a fight with an unwilling combatant. This is independent of the instigator penalty, and both are usually not assessed to the same player at one time . Attempt to injure Deliberately trying to harm an opponent . This type of infraction carries an automatic match penalty. Biting Carries a major penalty and Game Misconduct. Boarding Pushing, tripping or checking an opposing player violently into the boards. Butt-ending Jabbing an opponent with the end of the shaft of the stick. It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct. Broken stick Engaging in play while holding a broken stick. Charging Taking more than three strides or jumping before hitting an opponent. Checking from behind Hitting an opponent from behind is a penalty. It carries an automatic minor penalty and misconduct, or a major penalty and game misconduct if it results in injury. See checking. This is generally allowed in the NHL unless it's covered by another penalty such as boarding or illegal check to the head. Clipping Delivering a check below the knees of an opponent.  If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Cross-checking Hitting an opponent with the stick when it is held with two hands and no part of the stick is on the ice. Delay of gameStalling the game .  Starting in the 2004\u201305 AHL season and advanced to the NHL in the a year later, an automatic delay of game penalty is charged to goaltenders that go into the corners behind the goal line to play the puck. Some delay of game offenses, such as taking too long to send players to take a faceoff, are not punished with a penalty: instead, the official may choose to eject the centre of the offending team from the face-off circle and order him replaced with another player already on the ice. An unsuccessful coach's challenge will result in a minor penalty for delay of game for the first unsuccessful challenge and a double-minor penalty for each additional unsuccessful challenge. Diving Falling to the ice after a hit, exaggerating the effect of the hit in an attempt to draw a penalty for the opposing team. Elbowing Hitting an opponent with the elbow. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Eye-gouging Carries a major penalty and often a match penalty. Fighting Engaging in a physical altercation with an opposing player, usually involving the throwing of punches with gloves removed or worse. Minor altercations such as simple pushing and shoving, and punching with gloves still in place, are generally called as roughing. Goaltender Interference Physically impeding or checking the goaltender. Visually impeding the goaltender's view of the play with the body, called \"screening\", is legal; but at no time may a goaltender be hit or checked. Goaltender leaving the crease A goaltender may not leave the vicinity of his crease during an altercation. Once he has left the crease during an altercation, he may be given a penalty. Head-butting Hitting an opponent with the head. A match penalty is called for doing so. High-stickingTouching an opponent with the stick above shoulder level. A minor penalty is assessed to the player. If blood is drawn, a double-minor is usually called.  A common belief is that blood drawn automatically warrants a double-minor. There is no such rule; this is, however, the precedent that has been in place for years.  Referees may use their discretion to assess only a minor penalty even though blood was drawn.  They may also assess a double-minor when blood is not drawn, if they believe that the player was sufficiently injured or that the offending player used excessively reckless action with his stick.  If a player, while in the action of \"following through\" on a shot, strikes an opposing player in the head or face area with his stick, high sticking is not called unless the referee can determine that the player taking the shot was deliberately aiming to strike the opposing player. A penalty is also not called when the puck is hit by a high stick, but play will be stopped and the ensuing faceoff will take place at a spot which gives the non-offending team an advantage. Also, a goal that is scored by means of hitting the puck with a stick above the height of the crossbar will not be counted unless it is done by a player of the defending team. NHL referees can use on-ice video review to confirm or overturn a double-minor high sticking call. Holding Grabbing an opponent's body, equipment or clothing with the hands or stick. Generally a minor; USA Hockey rules call for a major and a game misconduct for grabbing and holding a facemask or visor. Holding the stick Grabbing and holding an opponent's stick, also called when a player deliberately wrenches a stick from the hands of an opposing player or forces the opponent to drop it by any means that is not any other penalty such as Slashing. Hooking Using a stick as a hook to slow an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. Illegal check to the head As of the start of the 2010\u201311 NHL season, any form of \"a hit to an opponent, where the player's head is targeted and/or the principal point of contact\" is punishable with a combination five-minute major penalty and game misconduct, due to the increasing concern following concussion injuries to NHL players following incidents such as David Booth and Marc Savard's concussions in the 2009\u201310 NHL season. A second incident of this type caused by the same player in a season results in an automatic suspension for the following game their team plays, with the potential for increasing durations of suspension from active play, for any subsequent checks to opposing players' head areas. The following season, it was changed to any hit to an opposing player's head that is targeted and the principal point of contact. An illegal check to the head is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty. In the 2013\u201314 NHL season, the rule was clarified to \"A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted . As mentioned before, that is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty.Rule 48 \u2013 Illegal Check to the Head Illegal equipmentUsing equipment that does not meet regulations, either by size or number or other guidelines , nor may they play with a goaltender's stick . If a player breaks a stick, it is mandatory to drop the stick immediately and play without it until getting a replacement from the bench. Otherwise this penalty will be assessed to the offending player . In addition, in the NHL a player may not pick a broken stick up off the ground after it has been dropped . This rule is generally not enforced in amateur leagues except for broken sticks or egregiously out-of-spec equipment, as the cost of acquiring gear that meets NHL specifications since a 2005 rule change is prohibitive, especially for goalies. Goaltenders will now receive a two-game suspension for the use of oversized equipment. Their teams will also be fined $25,000, the trainer will be docked $10,000, the coach and general manager fined $50,000 and the owner fined $100,000. Instigator penalty An instigator of an altercation is a player who demonstrates any of the following actions: distance travelled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude. A player deemed an instigator will receive an instigating minor penalty. A player who instigates a fight in the final five minutes of a game will instead be charged a game misconduct and given an automatic one-game suspension. The length of the suspension would double for each additional incident. The player's coach will be fined $10,000, a penalty that would double for each recurrence. Interference Impeding an opponent who does not have the puck, or impeding any player from the bench. No contact is required under the new standards. Joining a fight Also called the \"third man in\" rule, the first person who was not part of a fight when it broke out but participates in said fight once it has started for any reason is charged with an automatic game misconduct in addition to any other penalties they receive for fighting. Kicking Kicking an opponent with the skate or skate blade. Kicking carries a match penalty if done with intent to injure, but otherwise carries a major penalty and a game misconduct. Kneeing  Hitting an opponent with the knee. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Leaving the penalty bench  A penalized player who leaves the penalty bench before his penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional minor penalty after serving his unexpired penalty. Any player who, having entered the penalty bench, leaves the penalty bench prior to the expiration of his penalty for the purpose of challenging an official\u2019s ruling, shall be assessed a game misconduct penalty. He shall also be automatically suspended for at least the next three regular league or playoff games of his club. A player exiting the penalty bench, or player's bench, during an altercation or for the purpose of starting an altercation will be given a game misconduct, and suspended the next 10 games. Participating in the play beyond the centre red line A rare penalty, carries a minor penalty and is only assessed against the goaltender. Playing with too many sticks When a player plays with more than one stick. For example, if a goaltender were to lose his stick and a player from his team skates over to pick up the goaltender stick and then, while skating back to the goaltender with both sticks, attempts to touch a live puck with either stick, will be called for Playing with too many sticks. RoughingPushing or shoving after the whistle has been blown or when it takes place away from the play ; also called when the hands make contact with an opponent's head/face on an otherwise legal check; called in non-checking leagues when a body check is made. Non-checking leagues may also refer to this penalty as simply 'body checking'. In the NHL, a roughing minor penalty is assessed when a player intentionally removes the helmet of an opponent. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Secondary altercation  This infraction is not listed in the NHL Rulebook, but it is prevalent in the Central Hockey League and other minor leagues. It is most commonly issued when players engage in or attempt to engage in fight after the original fight . This infraction carries an automatic game misconduct penalty. Slashing  Swinging a stick at an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Slew footing  This occurs when a player uses his feet or knees to knock an opponent's skates out from under him with a kicking or leg dragging motion from behind. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Slew footing as a separate penalty does not exist in the USA Hockey rulebook . Spearing  Stabbing an opponent with the stick blade. It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct. Starting the wrong lineup This very rare bench minor penalty is called when the offending team's starting lineup contains any player not listed in the lineup submitted before the game. For this penalty to be called, the captain of the non-offending team must bring this breach of the rules to the referee's attention immediately at the first stoppage of play. Also the penalty may be given if a player is not put on the scoresheet at the beginning of the game and plays. The only way for this to be called is if the official scorer notifies the referee of this oversight. Substitution infraction This rare bench minor penalty is called when a substitution or addition is attempted during a stoppage of play after the linesmen have signaled no more substitutions or if a team pulls its goaltender and then attempts to have the goaltender re-enter play at any time other than during a stoppage of play. Too many men on the ice and/or starting the wrong lineup can also simply be called a substitution infraction. Throwing the stick/Throwing stick/Throwing equipment  Often accompanied by a penalty shot. If any player on the ice who throws his stick or any part thereof or any other object in the direction of the puck or an opponent in any zone, except when such act has been penalized by the assessment of a penalty shot or the awarding of a goal then a minor penalty will be assessed. Should any player, coach, or non-playing person on the players\u2019 bench or penalty bench throw anything on the ice during the progress of the game or during a stoppage of play, a bench minor penalty unsportsmanlike conduct shall be assessed. Can be upgraded to game misconduct or match penalty depending on severity. Too many men on the ice  Having more than the allowable number of players on the ice involved in the play at any given time. \"Involved in the play\" is key; players that are entering the ice as substitutes for players coming off may enter the ice once the player returning to the bench is less than five feet from his team's bench ; at that point the returning player is considered out of the play, even if the play passes in front of the bench, unless he actively makes a move for the puck. Players entering the ice are part of the play as soon as their skates touch the ice. Tripping Using a stick or one's body to trip an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Unsportsmanlike conduct  Arguing with a referee, fan, opponent or teammate; using slurs against an opponent, teammate or fan; playing with illegal equipment; making obscene gestures or abusing an official, fan, opponent or teammate. Can carry either a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty, depending on the gravity of the infraction Also, in some leagues the penalty progression is different for players and team officials . Unsportsmanlike conduct may also be called if a player drops gloves and stick in preparation for a fight, but the non-offending player does not drop the corresponding equipment and has committed no action to attempt to instigate a fight. Since 2008, the NHL has ruled that standing in front of an opposing goaltender and engaging \"in actions such as waving his arms or stick in front of the goaltender's face, for the purpose of improperly interfering with and/or distracting the goaltender\" will draw a minor unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, a rule interpretation inspired by the play of Sean Avery against Martin Brodeur."

        "content": "Coaches or players may occasionally opt to commit an infraction on purpose. In some cases, it is hoped that the infraction can be concealed from the officials, avoiding a penalty. Gordie Howe was one player renowned for his ability to commit infractions without being called. Hockey players that opt to commit an infraction despite the punishment do so in order to degrade the opposing team's morale or momentum, or boost their own. This is most common with fighting, because the likely coincidental penalties do not result in a hindrance for their team. Hockey players also sometimes commit infractions with the hope of drawing the other player into committing a retaliatory infraction, and being penalized, while not being caught themselves. Hockey players known as \"pests\" specialize their game in the strategy of trying to draw opponents into taking a penalty. An example is Sean Avery, who was renowned in his ability to goad opponents into taking penalties as well as making other fundamental mistakes. Some players, coaches, and fans find this technique unsportsmanlike. It is also not uncommon to see players \"dive\" or make a borderline hit appear to be a penalty by embellishing or exaggerating their reaction to it; this, however, is a penalty in itself, although it is inconsistently enforced. Another common reason to commit an infraction is as last resort when an opposing player has a scoring opportunity, when a penalty kill is the preferable alternative to the scoring opportunity.  These are referred to on most broadcasts as \"good penalties\"."

From that position the shooter rolls their back wrist quickly,  while thrusting the puck forward with the bottom hand. As the blade propels the puck forward the movement of the wrist rolls the puck toward the end of the blade,  causing the puck to spin. The tightness of the spin of the puck has an effect much like the spin a quarterback puts on their football pass, resulting in more accuracy. The puck is aimed with the follow-through of the shot, and will typically fly perfectly in the direction of the extension of the stick, resulting in an extremely accurate shot. At the same time, the stick flexes, so the moment the puck is released from the stick, the snap of the stick will propel the puck forward at high speeds. Current and former NHL players known for their wrist-shot include Joe Sakic, Alexander Ovechkin, Ilya Kovalchuk, Auston Matthews, Mari\u00e1n G\u00e1bor\u00edk, Jeff Carter, Evgeni Malkin, Jack Eichel, Teemu Sel\u00e4nne, Alexei Kovalev, Pavel Datsyuk, Phil Kessel, Wayne Gretzky, Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov, Peter Forsberg, Artemi Panarin, Markus N\u00e4slund, Nathan MacKinnon and Vladimir Tarasenko."

Many consider Joe Sakic to be the father of the modern snapshot, as he demonstrated incredible scoring ability while utilizing this quick-release shot throughout his career. He much preferred it to the wrist shot, which he was less known for. During his career, Phil Kessel has perfected a variation of the snap shot where the player transfers their weight to their \"puck foot\", or \"back foot\", and shoot in stride.

This is the lowest accuracy shot, but makes up for it in the difficulty it creates for a goaltender to properly position himself to defend against it.  Due to the elasticity of the rubber puck, it can also generate significantly more energy, giving it more speed and faster elevation.  When executed as a slapshot and finding its way into the goal, it is often known as a \"goal-scorers goal\" due to the difficulty of the timing and placement of the shot.  Current and NHL players known for their one-timers include Steven Stamkos, Alexander Ovechkin, Ilya Kovalchuk, Nikita Kucherov, Brent Burns, Shea Weber, Brett Hull, P. K. Subban, Evgeni Malkin, Artemi Panarin and Patrik Laine."

A count of how many shots are taken by a team is kept and this is often used as rough guide to which team is being more aggressive and dominant.  A scoring attempt in hockey is officially counted as a shot only when it is directed on goal, resulting in a goal or requiring the goaltender to make a save. The numbers of shots and saves in a game are especially relevant to goaltenders, whose save percentage is based on how many shots did not get past them.  The number of shots taken by skaters and the percentage on which they score is also measured, but these numbers are generally given less weight.  Some shots on goal are considered more likely to result in a goal and are called scoring chances."

        "content": "The Michigan, otherwise known as a Lacrosse style goal or the Zorro, can be considered as a special type of deke. It involves a player flipping the puck on the blade of the stick and then whipping the puck while carrying it on the blade. The shot is rarely witnessed due to its requirement for refined stickhandling skills and vulnerabilities for defensive maneuvers. Advantages of this shot are an element of surprise and capacity to position the puck accurately in to the top corner from odd angles. Consequently, the Michigan shot is usually attempted from behind the net by surprising a goaltender from a blindside while using the net as a cover from defense. The shot was first used in 1996 NCAA Tournament by a Michigan player Mike Legg, though the invention of the maneuver has been credited to Bill Armstrong. The Michigan has grown in popularity, and began to be attempted by NHL players in the mid-to-late 2010's. The shot has been attempted by players such as Sidney Crosby, Mikael Granlund, Ryan Getzlaf, Tyler Ennis, Miks Indra\u0161is, Evgeny Kuznetsov, Viktor Arvidsson, Claude Giroux, Patrik Laine, Auston Matthews and Trevor Zegras. The first and second successful Michigan goals in the NHL were by Andrei Svechnikov; Filip Forsberg and Trevor Zegras have also been successful with Michigan attempts."

The shaft of the stick and even body parts may also alter the trajectory of the puck and result in a valid goal, although scoring this way generally involves as much chance as deliberate effort. Tips careening off an offensive player's skate will count if no deliberate kicking motion was made. At close distance a well-directed tip that maintains some modicum of speed will pass by the goalie and into the net without the keeper having any possibility to react to the change in direction. Tipping the puck is a very common way to score a goal in today's NHL, and all teams use it frequently."

A player who shoots left holds the stick such that the blade is to the left of their body, with the left hand on the bottom and the right hand on top; a player who shoots right holds the stick such that the blade is to their right, with the right hand at the bottom and left hand on top.  The bottom hand delivers most of the power while the top hand is responsible for control and stickhandling, as well as the \"whip\" of your shots. Of the 852 players who skated in the 2007\u201308 NHL regular season, 554 of 852 shoot left. Many natural right handed players shoot left and vice versa. This is due to the fact that if someone is naturally right handed, they may shoot left because the top hand controls most of the stick's action."

        "content": "Zedn\u00edk was drafted in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals, in the tenth round, 249th overall, after playing junior hockey for the Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League . Zedn\u00edk scored 35 goals in his rookie year with the Winter Hawks during the 1994\u201395 season. In his second year with the major junior team, he scored 44 goals which earned him Second Team All-Star honours. Zedn\u00edk made his professional debut at the end of the 1995\u201396 season, playing in a single game with the Capitals before joining their minor league affiliate, the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League , for their Calder Cup finals playoff run. Zedn\u00edk made the Capitals' roster out of training camp in 1996 and scored his first career NHL goal in the season opener on October 5 against Ed Belfour of the Chicago Blackhawks. After one goal in nine games, Zedn\u00edk was sent down to Portland before being recalled briefly in March 1997. Zedn\u00edk played his first full NHL season in 1997\u201398, playing in 65 games with the Capitals and recording 17 goals. Zednik scored the first Capitals goal in Capital One Arena history. On October 31, 2000, a local Washington, D.C., radio station, DC101, had a promotion in which they offered fans a free ticket and Zedn\u00edk jersey if they dyed their hair blond as Zedn\u00edk had in the off-season. It was Zedn\u00edk's first game off of a suspension. Two-hundred \"Zed Heads\" attended the game at which Zedn\u00edk scored his first career hat-trick against the Detroit Red Wings, who had not lost in Washington in ten years. After spending six seasons with the Capitals, Zedn\u00edk was traded during the 2000\u201301 season, along with Jan Bulis and a first-round draft pick , to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Trevor Linden, Dainius Zubrus and a second-round draft pick on March 13, 2001. On April 26, 2002, during a playoff game in Montreal against the Boston Bruins, Zedn\u00edk was elbowed in the face by Bruins defenceman Kyle McLaren. Zedn\u00edk suffered a fractured cheekbone, broken nose and a concussion. Despite the Canadiens losing the game 5\u20132 and Zedn\u00edk for the remainder of the playoffs, they would win the series 4\u20132. After playing the next three years in Montreal, Zedn\u00edk was traded back to the Capitals on July 12, 2006, in exchange for a third-round draft pick. Zedn\u00edk's second stint back with the Capitals was short as he was dealt at the trade deadline to the New York Islanders for a second-round draft pick on February 26, 2007. At the conclusion of the 2006\u201307 season, Zedn\u00edk, a free agent, signed a two-year contract with the Florida Panthers on July 1, 2007. On April 30, 2009, Zedn\u00edk was announced as a Masterton Trophy finalist for the 2008\u201309 season. His nomination coincided with an official announcement that Zedn\u00edk signed to play for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl in the Kontinental Hockey League for the 2009\u201310 season. Zedn\u00edk's contract with Lokomotiv Yaroslaval was terminated \"by mutual agreement\" in the summer of 2010. Zedn\u00edk then played two games with HC 05 Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica of the Slovak Extraliga. On January 10, 2011, he signed a contract with AIK IF, which expired after the 2010\u201311 Elitserien season."

Teammate Olli Jokinen was tangled up with Sabre Clarke MacArthur and lost his balance in front of Zedn\u00edk. As Jokinen fell, Zedn\u00edk was skating past and his skate blade accidentally made contact with Zedn\u00edk's neck, slicing his common carotid artery open and causing it to expel a trail of blood onto the ice as Zedn\u00edk reacted quickly and skated to the Panthers' bench. He was immediately attended to by Florida trainer Dave Zenobi, who took him to the locker room for treatment. Paramedics, who are on standby at every NHL game, stabilized Zedn\u00edk while the home team doctor Les Bisson controlled the bleeding. Bisson noted that Zedn\u00edk appeared to be in shock but was not near death, as he was alert and responsive.  Zedn\u00edk was transported to hospital on emergency run, his status being published as stable after leaving the arena. The game was delayed for more than 20 minutes as the zamboni was needed to help remove the blood from the ice. The announcement over the public address speakers at HSBC Arena that Zedn\u00edk was in stable condition and en route to a Buffalo, New York, hospital sparked a prolonged standing ovation from the Buffalo fans as the game went on as planned. Emergency surgery was performed to repair the artery, but according to doctors at Buffalo General Hospital, Zedn\u00edk's life was not in jeopardy. The artery was not severed; had it been, it would have recessed into the neck, requiring more extensive surgery to repair. Zedn\u00edk was stable in the Intensive Care Unit through February 12 and released from hospital on February 16, but missed the rest of the season recovering from the injury. He received a lot of support for his injury by fans and fellow hockey players alike. Zedn\u00edk watched the video replay of his injury and said \"once is enough\". He said the extent of the injury was immediately obvious to him, as it felt like being stabbed. He returned to play in the 2008\u201309 season. Zedn\u00edk's injury drew comparisons of a similar injury suffered by Clint Malarchuk, who was a goalkeeper for the Buffalo Sabres back in 1989. The injuries both prompted discussion about neck guards and player safety in the NHL. At present, team doctors are trained in trauma care and are required to be seated behind the home team bench at every game."

They define the area within which the batsmen and bowlers operate. The term crease may refer to any of the lines themselves, particularly the popping crease, or to the region that they demark. Law 7 of the Laws of Cricket governs the size and position of the crease markings, and defines the actual line as the back edge of the width of the marked line on the grass, i.e., the edge nearest to the wicket at that end. Four creases are drawn at each end of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps. The bowling creases lie 22 yards apart, and mark the ends of the pitch. For the fielding side, the crease defines whether there is a no-ball because the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being a no-ball. This rule was replaced by a requirement that the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride must land with some part of it behind the popping crease ."

In the course of time, the scratches became cuts which were an inch deep and an inch wide. The cut was in use until the second half of the 19th century. Sometime during the early career of Alfred Shaw, he suggested that the creases should be made by lines of whitewash and this was gradually adopted through the 1870s."

Although it is considered to have unlimited length the popping crease need only be marked to at least  perpendicular to the pitch, on either side of the middle of the pitch.

The foot may be on the line as long as some part of his/her foot is behind the line. This has given rise to the term \"the line belongs to the umpire.\" In addition, a no-ball is called if the bowled ball bounces more than once before it reaches the popping crease of the striker, or if more than two non-wicketkeeping fielders are behind that popping crease on the on side at the time of the delivery. There is no limit to how far a bowler may bowl behind the crease other than that he must be visible to the umpire sufficient for him to verify that the bowling is indeed legal."

For a run-out, the wicket near the popping crease must be put down when the batsman is not within their ground behind the popping crease. A 2010 amendment to Law 29 clarified the circumstance where the wicket is put down while a batsman has become fully airborne after having first made his ground; the batsman is regarded to not be out of his ground. If the batsman facing the bowler steps out of his ground to play the ball but misses and the wicket-keeper takes the ball and puts down the wicket, then the striker is out stumped.

The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. He wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama. The city, led by Mayor Joe W. Davis, agreed to build a brand new 10,000-seat multipurpose stadium which lured the franchise to town where it began play in 1985 as the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded it, while the Stars were established as an entirely new franchise. Schmittou and several other Sounds shareholders owned the Stars, while Don Mincher, a Huntsville native and 12-year veteran of the major leagues, operated the team as its General Manager. Oakland Athletics The Huntsville Stars became the Double-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. Manager Brad Fischer guided the franchise to win the First Half Western Division title in their inaugural season. They then defeated the Knoxville Blue Jays, 3\u20131, in the Western Division finals on the way to winning their first Southern League championship in their first season by defeating the Charlotte O's, 3\u20132. Outfielder Jose Canseco was selected as the Southern League Most Valuable Player . In 1986, the Stars hosted the Southern League All-Star Game at Joe W. Davis Stadium on July 23.

In 1991, Huntsville hosted the first Double-A All-Star Game on July 10. A team of American League-affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of National League-affiliated All-Stars, 8\u20132. On August 3, 1992, pitchers Dana Allison, Roger Smithberg, and Todd Revering combined to pitch a 10-inning, 1\u20130 no-hitter against Birmingham. The Chattanooga Lookouts won both halves of the 1992 season, but Huntsville qualified for the postseason with the second-best overall record in the Western Division.

Milwaukee Brewers After the Stars and Athletics parted ways, Huntsville became the Double-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. The Stars struggled in their first two seasons of the new affiliation, failing to win any half of the seasons. In 2000, Mincher became Interim President of the Southern League when President Arnold Fielkow left for the National Football League. At the conclusion of the 2000 season, Mincher and his group put the Stars up for sale once again. He resigned from his position as President of the Stars, and the Southern League removed the \"interim\" tag to make him league president for 2001. Pulling double duty until the team was sold, Mincher desired to keep the Stars in Huntsville. The group waded through countless offers to buy the Stars looking to find the right investors who would commit to keeping the team in the Tennessee Valley. Early in 2001, Mincher found his man in New York attorney Miles Prentice who also owned the Midland RockHounds, served as a Director for the Texas League, and was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees for Minor League Baseball. Prentice promised to keep the team in Huntsville despite several offers for new stadiums in various locales. The Stars returned to the playoffs in 2001. Winning the First Half Western Division title, the team went on to win the division against Birmingham, 3\u20132. The September 11 attacks prompted the cancellation of the championship series before it could begin. Both Huntsville and the Eastern Division champion Jacksonville Suns were declared co-champions. Third baseman Dave Gibralter won the MVP Award for that summer's Double-A All-Star Game. In 2003, the first-half champion Stars won the Western Division versus Birmingham, 3\u20132, but lost in the Southern League championship series to Carolina, 3\u20132. Third baseman Corey Hart won the Southern League MVP Award, and manager Frank Kremblas was the league's Manager of the Year. Missing the playoffs in 2004 and 2005, they made another championship attempt in 2006, winning the second half, defeating Chattanooga, 3\u20130, for the Northern Division title, but losing the league crown to the Montgomery Biscuits, 3\u20131. In 2007, Stars manager Don Money was named the Southern League's Manager of the Year. Also in 2007, the team captured the division title, beating the Tennessee Smokies, 3\u20132, but were again defeated by Montgomery in the finals, 3\u20132. To start the 2008 season, the Stars set a new team record for best start, by sweeping their first series with the Mississippi Braves, 5\u20130. On April 26, 2008, the Stars turned their second triple play in franchise history, the last coming in 2002. David Welch pitched a 7-inning no-hitter against Chattanooga on June 2, 2008. The Stars won the 2009 first half title but lost the Northern Division to Tennessee, 3\u20131. Sub-.500 teams from 2010 to 2013 failed to reach the playoffs, the longest postseason drought in team history. During this stretch, however, Wily Peralta won the 2011 Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award and first baseman Hunter Morris won the 2012 MVP Award. On August 2, 2012, Jimmy Nelson, Dan Merklinger, R. J. Seidel, Darren Byrd, and Brandon Kintzler pitched a combined no-hitter against Chattanooga, a 3\u20131 win. Merklinger walked four batters in the fifth inning for the only Lookouts run of the game. Prior to the 2014 season, an ownership group based in Biloxi, Mississippi, led by Ken Young purchased the team with the intention of relocating the club. The Stars played the 2014 season in Huntsville, while a new ballpark was built in Biloxi. In their 30th and final season in Huntsville, the Stars won the first half title, but lost in the Northern Division series to Chattanooga, 3\u20132. Over 16\u00a0years as a Brewers affiliate, Huntsville compiled a record of 1,083\u20131,138 . The franchise's composite record over their entire 30-year run stood at 2,112\u20132,099 . Because of delays in the construction of Biloxi's MGM Park, the Biloxi Shuckers, as the team was named, played their first 54\u00a0games on the road, including 15 at Joe Davis Stadium in April and May 2015 before their June 6 home opener in Biloxi."

The removal of exit tunnels in Red sections 6, 7, 14, 15, 22, 23, 30 and 31, and Blue sections 2, 3, 10, 11, 18, 19, 26, 27, 34 and 35. The areas the tunnels occupied were replaced with seats, and the continuous wall that separated the red and blue sections was opened at each stairway. The removed exit tunnel openings in the wall that separated the red and upper gold sections were closed into a continuous wall between the remaining red exit tunnels. The Aud's seats were mostly made of white ash, but the gold seats were converted to padded cushion seats. From top to bottom , the seating colors went orange, blue , red and gold. In 1974, the city added five seats, increasing capacity for hockey in the 1974\u20131975 season to 15,863. After the hockey season, the city removed the walls and aisle that separated the upper gold and red seating sections. The 570 gold seats the city installed in the vacant space raised the arena's capacity to 16,433 for hockey and over 18,000 for basketball. In the late 1980s, the Buffalo Common Council and mayor James D. Griffin scaled back plans to renovate the Aud after the Sabres' owners made it clear the franchise's long-term viability depended upon a new arena. A compromise led the city to agree to build a new venue and keep the Aud functional until the new arena was complete. The 1990 renovation added designated handicap-accessible seating areas , new air conditioning and elevators. The money the city borrowed for these improvements was not repaid until 2001, five years after the Aud closed."

In 2003, the Sabres filmed a 30-minute infomercial inside the Aud to promote season ticket sales. While the production showed the arena was intact, it was without utilities and the crew had to supply all light and electrical sources. The Aud continued to deteriorate after the 2003 production visit. Water pipes ruptured, moisture began to take its toll and the city's lax monitoring led to graffiti, vandalism and theft of many artifacts. A segment aired during the CBC Television Hockey Night in Canada broadcast of the 2008 NHL Winter Classic showed the arena's seating bowl and floor were virtually untouched. Notably, the advertisements on the boards from the final Sabres game in 1996 against the Hartford Whalers and the scoreboard above center ice remained.

In December 2007, the city sold the Aud to the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation for $1 in hopes it would lead to asbestos removal and demolition. All salvageable items were to be removed and sold or stored. The sales of these artifacts, especially of seats, would help pay for a memorial to the Aud. The salvaged items include art deco flag holders, limestone eagles, a time capsule as well as a number of blue and orange level seats, which were sold at auction. The city also salvaged ten cylindrical stainless steel \"ice tanks\" that helped maintain chilly conditions at ice level during hockey season and cooled spectators during warmer weather. In 2007, the city moved them to Shea's Performing Arts Center as part of a $1.5 million overhaul of the landmark theater's heating and cooling system. Asbestos removal and other environmental remediation took place in late 2008 and the expected $10 million demolition of the Aud began in January 2009.

The structure's final pieces came down in early July 2009. In February 2010, Bass Pro Shops announced that it was no longer pursuing a store in Buffalo, leaving the site vacant."

Great Lakes Athletic Club owner Jack Herman continued booking shows at the venue before selling the promotion in 1947 to Ed Don George, who changed the promotion's name to Upstate Athletic Club. WBEN-TV would regularly broadcast Upstate Athletic Club's cards from the venue in 1948. Don George would later sell the promotion to his matchmaker, Ignacio \"Pedro\" Martinez, in 1955. Ilio DiPaolo, the son-in-law of Martinez, was the promotion's biggest star. WGR-TV broadcast Upstate Athletic Club's cards from the venue in 1956 as Wrestling from War Memorial Auditorium. Martinez would continue booking shows at The Aud until 1968, when he ran into financial trouble and was forced to promote outside the area. He returned in 1970 with his National Wrestling Federation, but the promotion folded in 1974. Jim Crockett Promotions debuted at the venue on July 19, 1980 with a show headlined by Ric Flair and Sweet Ebony Diamond defeating Greg Valentine and The Iron Sheik. The Honky Tonk Man defeated Ricky Steamboat to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship during a WWF Superstars of Wrestling taping at the venue on June 2, 1987. The inaugural Ilio DiPaolo Memorial Show was held at the venue on June 7, 1996 and was headlined by The Giant defeating Sting to retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. DiPaolo had died the previous year after being struck by a car. It was the final sporting event at the venue, and set the venue's all-time record for professional wrestling attendance with 14,852."

They are owned by the Welsh Rugby Union and play their home games at Rodney Parade, Newport and at other grounds around the region. They play in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup/European Rugby Challenge Cup. The region they represent covers an area of southeast Wales including Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen with a total population approaching 600,000 and they are affiliated with a number of semi-professional and amateur clubs throughout the area, including Pontypool RFC, Caerphilly RFC, Cross Keys RFC, Ebbw Vale RFC and Newport RFC. Formed in 2003 as a result of the introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales, the team started life with a third-place finish in the 2003\u201304 Celtic League, and finished fourth the next season; however, the team finished in the bottom three in each of the next four seasons. In 2007, they reached the semi-finals of the European Challenge Cup, losing to French side ASM Clermont Auvergne 46\u201329. In 2011, they reached the semi-finals of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, losing to Gloucester. They are yet to make the knock-out stage of the European Rugby Champions Cup."

Fundamental disagreements between the clubs saw a period of arbitration, led by the then Welsh Rugby Union chief executive David Moffett, which recommended the name \"Gwent Dragons\". On 28 July the side was launched under that name. This prompted Newport RFC benefactor Tony Brown of Bisley, Surrey to withdraw his financial support for the region. However, by 21 August Brown returned after Ebbw Vale chairman Marcus Russell resigned and the side's name was changed to \"Newport and Gwent Dragons\". With the Welsh Rugby Union demanding an explanation for the changes, and acrimony between the two clubs another agreement was struck: the side officially became  'Newport Gwent Dragons'. On 12 November 2003, the region's founding company Gwent Rugby Ltd entered into administration. On 27 November a new company, Dragons Rugby Ltd., was established to run the region, with Newport RFC and the Welsh Rugby Union each holding a 50% stake."

Despite starting their life in top-class rugby with a 35\u201311 defeat away to Llanelli Scarlets, it was the region's most successful season so far. A 29\u201319 win over the Ospreys was to prove more telling; captained by Andy Marinos the side remained unbeaten at home in the Celtic League and eliminated Stade Fran\u00e7ais in the Heineken Cup. Going into the final round with an outside chance of taking the title, the Dragons finished third in the Celtic League WRU bosses were impressed enough to appoint Ruddock to the vacant Welsh coaching job in summer 2004. In 2005, Ruddock guided Wales to a Grand Slam Title in the Six Nations. Ruddock rewarded two of his former Dragons players, Hal Luscombe and Jason Forster, with their first test caps on Wales' summer tour of Argentina. Wales  Percy Montgomery also impressed Springbok selectors enough to remind them of his international credentials, and earn a Tri Nations recall. The following off season saw a marked change in direction. Gareth Cooper, Kevin Morgan and Ceri Sweeney were amongst a handful of players who joined the region when the Celtic Warriors were disbanded. Having originally agreed to replace Mike Ruddock as head coach, Declan Kidney decided instead to seek employment back home with Leinster. It was not until 27 July 2004 that former Australia national rugby league team coach Chris Anderson was appointed, with Leigh Jones as his assistant. Another credible Celtic League campaign followed, finishing fourth, the second highest Welsh region. The side's Heineken Cup could be viewed as a wasted opportunity: the team beat French side Perpignan 27\u201314 at home, but were then beaten home and away by Newcastle Falcons to put paid to any quarter-final ambitions. Chris Anderson's contract was not extended beyond its initial one-year duration."

        "content": "The region looked to Harlequins backs coach Paul Turner, a Welshman, as their new head coach. Turner would also have to contend with Percy Montgomery returning to South Africa and Newport RFC stalwart Rod Snow retiring. Munster and Sale Sharks proved too strong in the 2005\u201306 Heineken Cup. After finishing 8th in the Celtic League, a 24\u201315 defeat Overmach Parma in a play-off for a place in the following seasons Heineken cup proved a new low for the region. Anglo-Welsh Cup wins over Leicester Tigers and Northampton Saints were the highlights of a tough season. Turner remained, but Wales international Hal Luscombe opted for a move away from the region, joining English Premiership side Harlequins. Former Wales captain Colin Charvis joined ahead of the 2006\u201307 season with the Dragons progressed into a European Challenge Cup semi-final, where they lost comfortably to ASM Clermont Auvergne. Domestically though, the region's European exploits appeared to take their toll, finishing ninth in the Celtic League. Significantly the region avoided the prospect of a second season away from the Heineken Cup, defeating another Italian side Calvisano 22\u201315. The match also marked the end for departing Wales internationals Ian Gough and Gareth Cooper at Rodney Parade. 2007\u201308 proved to be another difficult season for the region. Signings such as scrum-half Andy Williams and flanker Richard Parks were not able to help reverse the side's fortunes. The Dragons 2007\u201308 Heineken Cup campaign only saw one win against Italian side Treviso and exiting the Anglo-Welsh Cup in the pool stages for a third year running. Between completing a double over Llanelli Scarlets on 1 January to defeating the Ospreys on 6 May, the Dragons failed to win a Celtic League game. Despite finishing as the lowest-placed Welsh side in the league the region qualified for next season's Heineken Cup, without having to play off against Italian opposition due to a failure by the Italian League to finish before a specified date. The summer of 2008 marked a change in the Dragons recruitment policy to a more antipodean focus. Several new signings included New Zealander Tom Willis who was also appointed captain. The 2008\u201309 Heineken Cup saw visible signs of encouragement for the region. An opening round defeat of Glasgow at Rodney Parade and two respectable defeats to French giants Toulouse, sandwiched between narrow losses against Bath offered hope of arresting decline at Rodney Parade. Domestically in the Celtic League it was a case of same old as consecutive defeats in rearranged matches away at Cardiff Blues and the Ospreys ended any hopes of avoiding finishing as the lowest placed Welsh region and another Heineken Cup play off against Italian opposition. In record appearance holder Adam Black's final game for the side, the Dragons ran out comfortable winners away to Calvisano to secure their place in European rugby's premier tournament for a third season running. The 2009\u201310 season brought about significant improvements in results, with the Dragons remaining unbeaten at Rodney Parade in the Celtic League until their final home match, a 20\u201314 loss to Cardiff Blues. Defeat also brought about the end of the Dragons bid to qualify for the inaugural Celtic League play offs. An improved seventh-place finish did, however, mean automatic qualification for the Heineken cup as the third highest finishing Welsh region. Despite coming close to defeating Gloucester away at Kingsholm and a win at home against Glasgow, back to back losses at Biarritz put paid to the Dragons chances of progressing past the group stages of the Heineken Cup for the first time."

        "content": "The naming of the region's team caused considerable turbulence. Newport Gwent Dragons were a new side created out of the restructuring of Welsh rugby, and represent their designated region, like the Cardiff Blues, the Scarlets and the Ospreys. Some in the Welsh rugby world, such as Bobby Windsor, believed that including the name Newport would alienate some fans in the surrounding valleys. Many supporters in the wider Newport area favoured greater identification with the City of Newport and a continuation of the historic traditions of Newport RFC. Several names were suggested but all were rejected by the WRU. In the end, the WRU decided the region would be called the Gwent Dragons. However, initial response to the new region was mixed, with many fans unsure whether to buy a season ticket for the new side or to stick to their local clubs. The company set up to run the side entered administration before a game had been played, and as a compromise the word \"Newport\" was added to the team name in a double-sized font, whilst \"Gwent\" was reduced. This addition and choice of kit added a greater Newport emphasis to the region and polarised the regions' fan base: some supporters of Ebbw Vale, Pontypool, Cross Keys and Newbridge turned their backs on the regional side, claiming that Gwent was no longer being equally represented. This debate continued, with the Dragons being accused of favouritism towards their Newport feeder club rather than the other feeder clubs. The Newport Action Group, among others, claimed the side has lost more supporters by including the name \"Gwent\" in its title. The crowds supporting Newport Gwent Dragons averaged 5,154 for the 2005\u201306 season, whereas in the 2002\u201303 season, Newport RFC was Wales' best supported club and British rugby's fourth best with an average attendance of 8,302 \u2013 behind English Premiership clubs Leicester, Gloucester and Northampton. Although controversy surrounding the naming of the region might be considered petty, rugby in South Wales is deeply divided among hundreds of historic rugby clubs with bitter rivalries. In the 2006\u201307 season, attendance averaged 5,629 at Rodney Parade."

In 1991 these shares were revised to 36%, 24%, 12%, 3% and 1% respectively, and when both major leagues realigned again in 1995 , the 3% shares went to teams losing in the Division Series and the 1% shares went to the teams that finished second in their division but did not earn a wild card."

In his senior season at Oregon, he threw for 2,415 yards and 23 touchdowns, and he finished his college career with a 25-3 record , 512 completions in 928 attempts , 6,911 passing yards, 59 touchdowns, 23 interceptions, and 210 rushing yards and 18 scores on 145 carries. A business administration major with a 3.23 GPA , Harrington's 7,121 yards of total offense rank sixth in University of Oregon history. Harrington finished fourth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy in 2001, following a campaign for the award that included a billboard in Times Square promoting him as \"Joey Heisman.\" He earned numerous honors, including first-team All-American, Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year, and second-team honors from The Sporting News. He was one of five finalists for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award in 2001. EA Sports selected him for the cover of the 2003 edition of their NCAA Football video game series. Harrington was given the nickname \"Captain Comeback\" among fans for his ability to lead Oregon to victory in late game situations, accumulating a record of 11-2 in games in which the Ducks trailed or were tied in the fourth quarter. Harrington's best collegiate game was arguably the 2002 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona when he threw for 350 yards and four touchdowns and helped lead the Ducks to a 38-16 victory over Colorado. Harrington was named offensive player of the game. Harrington's worst game was arguably the 2000 Civil War in which he passed 24-36 for 333 yards, but threw five interceptions. Three of those interceptions were by Oregon State defensive back Jake Cookus. #8 Oregon State ultimately won 23-13 over then-#6 Oregon."

        "content": "Harrington was selected by the Detroit Lions with the third pick overall in the 2002 NFL Draft. Harrington took over for incumbent Mike McMahon late in the Lions' Week 1 loss against the Miami Dolphins and became the Lions' starting quarterback shortly thereafter, finishing that year with a 50.1 completion percentage, a ratio of 12 touchdowns to 16 interceptions, and a 59.9 quarterback rating; the Lions finished the season with a 3\u201313 record. He was named the 2002 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year Award. Harrington's career in Detroit was largely unsuccessful. Front office mismanagement, woeful offensive line protection, lack of talent at other skill positions, and an erratic philosophical change in the team's identity to a conservative West Coast Offense oriented attack under Head Coach Steve Mariucci may have played a factor in Harrington not realizing his potential professionally, as well as his own play and lack of talent. Harrington's best season as a Lion came in 2004, when he threw for 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. The Lions started the season with a 4\u20132 record, but Harrington led the team to only two more wins the rest of the season. The Lions finished 6\u201310 and missed the playoffs for the fifth season in a row. On October 23, 2005, Mariucci chose to bench Harrington in favour of veteran Jeff Garcia for the team's game against the Cleveland Browns to try to provide a spark to the team's 2\u20133 start. The Lions won 13\u201310, and Garcia rushed for Detroit's only touchdown. After yet another dismal offensive performance, Mariucci declared that Garcia would remain the starter. That marked the first time since the 2002 season that Harrington did not appear in a Lions' game, breaking a string of 37 consecutive appearances. Harrington regained the starting role the week after Garcia threw a game-ending interception returned for a touchdown in overtime against Chicago. Harrington started again for Detroit on November 13, 2005, against the Arizona Cardinals, throwing for three touchdowns without an interception in the Lions' 29\u201321 win. Harrington was voted by Lions fans as their Offensive Player of the Year, according to the Lions' official website. Despite his difficult times in Detroit, he remained unwaveringly optimistic and was thus dubbed \"Joey Blue-Skies\" and \"Joey Sunshine\" by sarcastic Lions' fans and beat writers who grew tired of his predictable post-game commentary as the losses continued to mount."

Many speculate that his premature start in the NFL, along with lack of surrounding talent, poor coaching, and questionable offensive lines have affected his performance severely. Many other quarterbacks, such as Tim Couch and David Carr, were also drafted highly and eventually lost their starting jobs. In 2005, former quarterback Troy Aikman wrote that Harrington \"can still be a really good quarterback in this league,\" and does not deserve the blame for what happened in Detroit: \"The focus on Joey's play has given every other player a hall pass, and that's not right.\" Former quarterback Phil Simms said in 2006 that Harrington got a bad rap in Detroit. \"I am not a Joey Harrington basher. The quarterback can't overcome bad coaching and bad players.\" Former quarterback Dan Marino said that he did not believe that Harrington had the necessary pieces around him in Detroit to be successful, but that he might be OK in a different place. When Lions head coach Steve Mariucci was fired by general manager Matt Millen, Lions cornerback Dr\u00e9 Bly told analyst Rich Eisen in an NFL Total Access interview that he blamed Harrington for the dismissal of Mariucci. Bly later apologized to the Lions, but not to Harrington. Some fingers were also pointed at the Lions' management and coaching staff. Fellow Lions quarterback Jeff Garcia publicly questioned the team's front office, saying on WXYT that \"You start to question whether the organization has the people in place who can go about making the proper selections.\" Former defensive end Howie Long said that Millen made a mistake by drafting Harrington, along with signing Garcia instead of Brad Johnson."

After playing college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, Carter was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN's Chris Berman's famous quotes about Carter: \"All he does is catch touchdowns.\"  He was let go by Ryan in 1989, however, due to off-the-field issues. Carter was signed by the Vikings and turned his life and career around, becoming a two-time first-team and one-time second-team All-Pro and playing in eight consecutive Pro Bowls.

Carter became a consensus All-America selection after his junior season, Ohio State's first All American at wide receiver. Carter had intended to play both football and basketball at Ohio State, but decided to focus on football after making an immediate impact his freshman year. That year, he set a Rose Bowl record with nine receptions for 172 yards.  In his junior season, he caught 69 passes for 1,127 yards and 11 touchdowns. Carter was known for great hands, running precise routes, and for acrobatic leaps. He had remarkable body control and footwork when making catches near the sidelines.  At the Citrus Bowl at the end of the 1985 season, Carter caught a ball that quarterback Jim Karsatos was intending to throw away. Karsatos has claimed that catch by Carter was the greatest in the history of college football: \"When I finally saw it on film, he was tiptoeing the sidelines and he jumped up and caught the ball left-handed by the point of the football at least a yard out of bounds.  Then he somehow levitated back in bounds to get both his feet in bounds. I swear to this day he actually levitated to get back in bounds.  When I saw it on film, it just blew me away.\" Prior to Carter's senior season, he secretly signed with notorious sports agent Norby Walters.  When the contract was discovered, Carter was ruled ineligible. The absence of Carter in the 1987 offense contributed to a disappointing 6\u20134\u20131 season and the firing of Coach Bruce. Missing this season also cost him a chance at evening his personal record against Michigan; Carter finished 1\u20132, his lone taste of victory in the series being his freshman year. Despite losing his senior year, Carter left Ohio State holding the school record for receptions , gaining 2,725 yards and 27 touchdowns from them. In 2000, he was selected as a member of the Ohio State Football All-Century Team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame."

Carter finished the 1990 campaign with 27 receptions for 413 yards and 3 touchdowns. In 1991, Carter stepped forward as Minnesota's top pass catcher.

Carter teamed up with Moon in 1995 to post his finest statistical season. He caught 122 passes for a career-high 1,371 yards and led the NFL with 17 touchdown receptions. Carter received Second-team All Pro honors for his efforts. The Vikings, however, finished 8\u20138 and missed the playoffs for the first time under Green.

The Vikings returned to the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record, but were routed by the Dallas Cowboys 40\u201315 in the Wild Card round. Carter appeared in his fourth straight Pro Bowl following the season. Carter continued to be the focal point of the Vikings' offense in 1997. He was named to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl, leading the NFL with 13 touchdown receptions while pacing the team with 89 catches and 1069 yards. Even though he had more impressive seasons statistically, 1997 may have been Carter's finest hour, as week after week he dazzled with one spectacular catch after another. With Randall Cunningham at QB the Vikings finally broke through in the playoffs, defeating the Giants 23\u201322 in a last-minute miracle comeback. The playoff success was fleeting, however, as the team fell to the San Francisco 49ers 38\u201322 the following week. In 1998 the Vikings drafted Marshall wide receiver Randy Moss with 21st pick in the first round. Suddenly, the Vikings possessed the NFL's most dangerous weapon. They cruised through the regular season, posting a 15\u20131 record while scoring a then-league record 556 points. Carter, who made the Pro Bowl for the fifth time, caught 78 passes for 1,011 yards and 12 touchdowns. Led by Moss, Carter, and Miller Lite Player of the Year Randall Cunningham, the Vikings entered the playoffs as heavy favorites to reach the Super Bowl. They easily defeated the Arizona Cardinals 41\u201321 in the Divisional Round, advancing to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1987. The Vikings entered that game as 13 and a half point favorites over the Atlanta Falcons, but lost in overtime 30\u201327 to become the biggest favorite to ever lose a home playoff game. Carter later said losing that game was the lone regret of his time in Minnesota, and that he didn't even know if he wanted to play anymore afterwards. The following year, Carter had his finest individual season since 1995\u2014 the First-team All Pro caught 90 passes for 1241 yards and an NFL-best 13 touchdowns. The Vikings easily defeated the Dallas Cowboys 27\u201310 in the Wild Card round and headed to St. Louis to face the NFL's new hottest offense. Minnesota led the eventual Super Bowl champions 17\u201314 at the half, but a second-half flurry led to a 49\u201337 Rams win. Carter finished the decade of the '90s with 835 receptions, second only to Jerry Rice's 860, and was named to the NFL's All Decade team. In 2000, led by Daunte Culpepper, the Vikings won the NFC Central division, and Carter finished the season with 96 receptions, 1274 yards, 9 touchdowns, and an eighth Pro Bowl. On November 30, Carter became only the second player in NFL history to reach the 1,000 reception plateau when he caught a 4-yard touchdown pass against Detroit. In 2001, the Vikings floundered with a record of 5\u201311, their first losing season since 1990. Carter's production dipped to its lowest point since 1992 \u2014 73 catches, 871 yards, 6 touchdowns \u2014 and his streak of eight straight Pro Bowls came to an end. Following the season, the longest-tenured Viking exercised an out clause in his contract that ended his career in Minnesota. Cris Carter left the Vikings as their all-time leader in, among other things, receptions , receiving yards , and touchdowns ."

Although he talked with the Rams, Browns, and Dolphins, he was unable to complete a deal and joined HBO's Inside the NFL team as an analyst on May 21. He served in that capacity until October 21 when the Miami Dolphins lured the veteran back onto the playing field to bolster their injury-riddled receiving corps. The Boca Raton resident started in his first game as a Dolphin at Lambeau Field in Week 9. Carter showed signs of rust, catching just three passes for 31 yards and fumbling once. During the week that followed, he checked into the hospital with a kidney ailment and was sidelined for the next four weeks. Carter returned in Week 14, but struggled to get back into the Dolphins receiver rotation. In Week 15, however, he caught a one-handed touchdown pass as the Dolphins beat the Raiders 23\u201317. The following week against the Vikings, however, he made a key drop in the end zone that cost Miami a touchdown. The Dolphins wound up losing that game and then lost to the Patriots the following week, missing the playoffs. Even though he put up respectable numbers for the number of games that he played, he retired after the season."

Carter is one of 14 players in NFL history with 1,000 or more receptions.  He was named to the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team. Carter was one of 15 finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2008, but was not elected in a surprise to some commentators. Carter was once again excluded in 2009 and again in 2010 as receivers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown became eligible for the first time, though Brown did not make it. Additionally, Andre Reed was another possible candidate that diminished Carter's chance for enshrinement in 2010.  In 2011, he also did not make it despite not having a single wide receiver in the class. NFL Network's NFL's Top 10 placed him atop the list of wide receivers with the best hands. On February 2, 2013, Carter was announced as an inductee into the Hall of Fame Class of 2013 along with Bill Parcells, Larry Allen, Jonathan Ogden, Warren Sapp, Curley Culp, and Dave Robinson."

Carter was a speaker at the 2008 NFL rookie symposium and again at the 2009 NFL Rookie Symposium. He also spoke at the 2014 NFL rookie symposium, where he encouraged players to get a fall guy they can trust to take the blame if they get in trouble. The comments were revealed in 2015 in an ESPN The Magazine story about Chris Borland. The NFL took the video of the speech down from its website and released a statement saying in part: \"The comment was not representative of the message of the symposium or any other league program...The comment was not repeated in the 2014 AFC session or this year's symposium.\" Carter apologized on Twitter, saying he realized it was bad advice, and everyone should take responsibility for their own actions. ESPN also released a statement saying Carter's comments do not reflect the company's views. Carter was chosen to be a coach for a team in the 2015 Pro Bowl, along with former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin. In December 2016, Carter was hired by Fox Sports as a football analyst. In May 2017, his role was expanded as it was announced that Carter would co-host a morning show, First Things First, on Fox Sports 1 with radio personality Nick Wright and moderator Jenna Wolfe.

This rapid development drew the attention of the International Olympic Committee , which initiated a discussion in 1988 to include it in the  Olympic Games program. The then IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch held a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden with the intention of making triathlon an Olympic sport as soon as possible. At that meeting Canadian Les McDonald was selected as President to a working committee for triathlon, while Sweden's Sture Jonasson was elected as Secretary. World Triathlon was founded as the International Triathlon Union one year later, on April 1, 1989, at the first ITU Congress in Avignon, France. A total of 30 National Federations attended the initial Congress and preparations were made for the sport's first World Championships to be held in Avignon in August 1989. At this meeting the Olympic distance was set at a 1.5-km swim, 40-km bike and 10-km run the distances were chosen as they were already present at the Olympics for each discipline individually. More than 800 athletes representing 40 countries competed in the first World Championships, and Canada's Les McDonald was elected as ITU's first president in 1989. ITU began the World Cup series in 1991, staging 11 races in eight countries. Triathlon was officially added to the Olympic Programme by the IOC at its Congress in Paris in 1994. Triathlon made its Olympic debut at the 2000 Games in Sydney, with Switzerland's Brigitte McMahon and Canada's Simon Whitfield earning the sport's first gold medals Since its inception World Triathlon has maintained its headquarters in Vancouver, Canada until January 1, 2014 when it moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, home of the IOC and many international sporting bodies. Spain's Marisol Casado was elected as World Triathlon's second president in November 2008. She became an IOC member in February 2010 at the 122nd IOC Session in World Triathlon's hometown of Vancouver. She was re-elected for a new four-year term in October 2012. The Canadian Loreen Barnett maintains its general secretary 3, with Sarah Springman named 1st\u00a0 vice-president and honorary member of the World Federation, hence in 2012 it was the only worldwide federation of an Olympic sport with an all-female management. In December 2016, Marisol Casado was re-elected for a third term as president of the International Federation at the 29th Congress held in Madrid 6. In 2009 the International Triathlon Federation reorganised its top level competitions changing the World championship to the World Triathlon Series, an eight-stage competition circuit in eight countries, and relegated the world cup down to a second tier series below the world series with less prize money and world ranking points. It also organizes a series of world competitions at different distances from chained sports derived from the triathlon it manages, such as duathlon, aquathlon, cross-triathlon, winter triathlon and paratriathlon. In June 2017, following the renewal of the federal application, the International Olympic Committee included a third triathlon event on the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, the mixed team relay. With the men's and women's short-distance triathlon events, three triathlon events offer Olympic titles to triathletes. By joining other sports who practice these forms of mixed events, this approach within the scope of the promotion of equality policies between men and women triathletes supported by the international federation and its president Marisol Casado. In September 2017, World Triathlon announced the death of its founding and honorary President, Les McDonald, at the age of 84. The special press release, retraced his sporting and professional career, focusing on his success in obtaining Olympic status for triathlon in 2000, as well as his leadership of the federation for 20 years. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 2013 for service to the nation and inducted into the its  \"Hall of Fame\" in 2014 for all of his work for triathlon. In October 2020, the ITU officially adopted the name World Triathlon."

Another is athlete scholarships to be given to young athletes that have shown talent but who need more support than their developing National Federation can give, allowing them to perform at an international level, the end goal of these scholarships is the athletes performing for their county at the Olympic games. One global development is the introduction of certifications for coaching and technical officials meaning that important events will be contested at the high level."

This triathlon distance has become known as the standard distance in the world of triathlon. In 1994 to have a long-distance championship similar to Ironman Triathlon events but hosted by the sports governing body the Long Distance Triathlon World Championships was founded and in 1997 parity was brought to duathlon with the Long Distance Duathlon World Championships. Also in 1997 the first Winter Triathlon World Championships was held giving the sport of winter triathlons its own world championship. Then in 1998 the Aquathlon World Championships were inaugurated, giving aquathlon its own world championship.

        "content": "In the sport of cricket, a slower ball is a slower-than-usual delivery from a fast bowler.   The bowler's intention is to deceive the batsman into playing too early so that he either misses the ball completely or hits it high up in the air to offer an easy catch. It is analogous to a changeup in baseball. The slower ball, also known as the 'Wandi ball' technique was popularised in response to the demands of limited-overs cricket, not only to get wickets but also to slow down the scoring rate, as a slower ball will not carry to the boundary as easily as a normal fast delivery if it is hit square or behind the wicket. It is especially used in the last ten or so overs as variation in speed, in addition to line and length, is the key to preventing a late flurry of runs from the batsmen. To be effective, the slower ball must be directed at or near the stumps in order to force the batsman to play, and the bowler's action must appear entirely normal. There are various tricks that the bowler can employ to slow the ball down: Bowling from the back of the hand, effectively a fast googly Bowling with split fingers: the fingers are placed either side of the seam of the ball, and the ball is bowled full-length; when done correctly the delivery will appear to be a full toss until it suddenly drops.  A similar technique is used to throw the split-finger fastball in baseball. Sri Lankan Dilhara Fernando holds the ball between the index and middle finger, and just fits it in the webbing between the two.  This leads to the delivery of a slow loopy ball Bowling a knuckleball, where the ball is held on the knuckles of the index and middle fingers. To a batsman, it resembles a stock ball due to it appearing as if the bowler was holding the ball in a regulation manner Off cutter: instead of placing the index and middle fingers in the orthodox position together on the seam, the middle finger is moved round the ball slightly and then pulled down as the ball is released.  The ball will tend to \"break\" or \"cut in\" from left to right as it pitches, as it does with off spin bowling. It can be effective to only bowl this ball with a single finger on top and it typically rests to the right hand side of the seam Leg cutter: the same as an off cutter except that the fingers go the other way and the ball will tend to cut from right to left.  Harder to keep straight than an off cutter Palm ball: the ball is held in the palm instead of the fingers; this can be effective but is hard to disguise Holding the ball deeper in the fingers. Typically, quick bowlers hold the ball at their fingertips. Holding the ball deeper within the fingers slows the release of the ball. Brett Lee is an exponent of this method Reduction in the speed of the action: Can be quite effective as a \"different\" type of change of pace. Effectively you change only the rotation of your arm and retain your action Cross-seam: This type of slower delivery is also popularly employed by medium pacers wherein the bowler holds the ball across the seam instead of holding it on the seam thereby the pace of delivery is reduced when the ball hits the ground. New Zealand medium pace bowler Gavin Larsen used this effectively in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. This can be coupled with a \"split fingers\" style release to result in a delivery which dips sharply at the end of its trajectory or spits from a pitched-up length Zero rotation: Using a specific type of grip & release it is possible to impart little or no rotation on the ball. This lack of rotation causes an instability in air pressure, which makes the ball move erratically through the air Single finger: Using a variation on the in-swinger grip where the index finger and thumb are both fully on the seam of the ball and the second finger barely touches it. Less force on the ball at the point of release results in reduced pace Thumb ball: Bowled using the same grip as a stock delivery, barring the palm position, which is facing up instead of down, so that it looks like a back of the hand grip. This can be an effective delivery, but it is hard to produce"

        "content": "Although a slower ball is usually the result when a bowler tries a change of pace, some bowlers have a delivery which is even faster. Pakistani Imran Khan was one example: in his coaching book, he mentioned that it was far more effective to have a faster ball than a slower one. Spinners and slow bowlers generally employ the faster ball more often than pacemen. Pakistan's Shahid Afridi has used this ball quite successfully over his career."

        "content": "Robert Jerry Lanier Jr. was born on September 10, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, the son of Robert Sr. and Nannette Lanier. Growing up in Buffalo, Lanier initially was rejected in his basketball efforts. Trying out for his grammar school team, Lanier was told by a coach that his feet were too large for him to be a successful athlete. Although he was 6-foot-5 by age 16, Lanier didn't make the varsity basketball squad in his sophomore year at Bennett High School under coach Nick Mogavero because he was deemed too clumsy. In his junior year, he was encouraged to try out again by new coach Fred Schwepker, who had Lanier in Biology class. Lanier tried out again. Lanier averaged 21.5 points for Bennett High School and was named to the All-City team as a junior. In his senior year, he averaged 25.0 points and he earned All-Western New York State honors. Both years he led Bennett to Buffalo city titles. After his successes under coach Schwepker, Lanier graduated in 1966. Lanier was recruited by more than 100 universities, but he elected to attend St. Bonaventure University, under legendary Coach Larry Weise. \u201cThere was recruiting competition, but the advantage I had, and what I sold was that his parents could come watch him play,\u2019\u2019 Said Coach Weise. \u201cHe picked St. Bonaventure. His parents were at every game.\u2019\u2019"

        "content": "Lanier was a three-time Converse All-America selection , playing for coach Weise at St. Bonaventure. In 1970, he led the St. Bonaventure to the NCAA Final Four. He injured his knee near the end of the regional championship game in a collision with Villanova's Chris Ford and did not participate in St. Bonaventure's National Semifinal loss to Jacksonville University with center Artis Gilmore. That year he was named Coach and Athlete Magazine player of the year, and the ECAC Player of the Year. Sophomore As a  sophomore in the 1967\u201368 season, after having played on the freshman team the previous year per NCAA rules at the time, Lanier made an immediate national impact, as he led the St. Bonaventure to an undefeated regular season and a no. 3 final poll ranking. Lanier averaged 26.2 points and 15.6 rebounds. Against Loyola Maryland, Lanier had 27 rebounds, leading St. Bonaventure to a 94\u201378 victory. In the 23-team 1968 NCAA Tournament, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to a 102\u201393 victory over Boston College and coach Bob Cousy. The Bonies were then defeated 91\u201372 by North Carolina and coach Dean Smith in the East Regional Semifinal, ending their undefeated season. Lanier had 32 points and 15 rebounds in the victory over Boston College and 23 points with 9 rebounds in the North Carolina loss. Lanier then fouled out, scoring 18 points with 13 rebounds in the third-place East Region game, a 92\u201375 loss to Columbia. Lanier was named second-team All-American, behind Lew Alcindor at center. Junior In the 1968\u201369 season, St. Bonaventure finished 17-7 after starting the season 3\u20135. Against Seton Hall, Lanier scored 51 points, the single-game scoring record for St. Bonaventure. Lanier, averaged 27.3 points and 15.6 rebounds in 24 games. Lanier was again named second-team All-American, behind Lew Alcindor at center. During his junior year, Lanier was approached by representatives of the American Basketball Association's New York Nets, who reportedly offered him $1.2 million to leave school early and join the ABA. However, following his father's advice, Lanier chose to remain in school. Senior: NCAA Tournament and knee injury Lanier averaged 29.2 points and 16.0 rebounds as St. Bonaventure finished the 1969\u201370 regular season 25\u20131 and a no. 3 national ranking. In the 25-team 1970 NCAA Tournament, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to an 80\u201372 victory over Davidson College with 28 points and 15 rebounds; he had 24 points and 19 rebounds in an 80\u201368 victory over NC State, and 26 points and 14 rebounds in the 97\u201374 victory over Villanova, as St. Bonaventure to advanced to the Final Four. However, Lanier injured his knee near the end of the regional championship game in a collision with Villanova's Chris Ford. It was severe enough that he could not play in the Final Four and eventually required surgery, the first of eight surgeries on Lanier's knees. In the Final Four, the Bonnies lost to Jacksonville University with future Hall of Fame center Artis Gilmore. St. Bonaventure was whistled for 32 personal fouls and outscored 37\u201315 at the free-throw line, in the 91\u201383 loss. In the third-place game, the Bonnies lost to NM State to finish the season 25\u20133. \"Every year at this time you start thinking about it and my players start thinking about it,\" reflected Coach Larry Weise at age 81. \"We have a reunion every three, four years and it\u2019s the same with them. It was a magical moment in our lives, no question. In our hearts, we knew we were good enough to win the championship.\" \"I think I appreciate it even more than my teammates,\" Lanier reflected on the Final Four in 1985, \"because I had a basis for comparison. It wasn't the money, or who got the 'numbers' like in the NBA. We weren't any big stars, it was a couple of guys from Buffalo and a guy from Troy all blending together.\" Lanier was named first-team All-American at center, alongside future Hall of Famers Dan Issel , Pete Maravich and Calvin Murphy , along with College Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Mount . Lanier graduated from St. Bonaventure with a degree in business administration. Lanier holds St. Bonaventure records for scoring and rebounding, averaging 27.6 points and 15.7 rebounds, with 57% shooting in 75 career games."

        "content": "Detroit Pistons Lanier was the number one overall pick by the National Basketball Association's Detroit Pistons in the 1970 NBA draft. He was also a territorial pick by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association in the 1970 ABA Draft. The Nets had approached Lanier about turning professional after his junior year of college, but he declined because he felt St. Bonaventure could compete for a national championship. Still recovering from knee surgery, Lanier signed with the Pistons, who eagerly presented him his NBA contract while he was still in the hospital recuperating from his knee surgery. Lanier reported to Pistons training camp limping, in significant pain, and overweight from his long period of inactivity following the surgery. Lanier played while still recovering from surgery. He was named to the 1971 NBA All-Rookie Team, averaging 15.6 points and 8.1 rebounds, for the 45\u201337 Pistons, in 24 minutes per game under Coach Butch van Breda Kolff. \"I wasn't healthy when I got to the league,\" Lanier reflected. \"I shouldn\u2019t have played my first year. But there was so much pressure from them to play, I would have been much better off\u2014and our team would have been much better served\u2014if I had just sat out that year and worked on my knee. My knee was so sore every single day that it was ludicrous to be doing what I was doing.\" Lanier rehabilitated his knee with the help of Coach van Breda Kolff, who had Lanier stay at his beachfront house for 2\u00bd weeks to run in the sand and strengthen his knee and legs. Lanier became a star for Detroit, playing alongside teammate Dave Bing and averaging more than 21 points per game for each of the next eight seasons, with a high mark of 25.7 PPG in the 1971\u201372 season, and more than 11 rebounds per game in seven straight seasons. Lanier's latter years in Detroit were marred by recurring injuries, as he never played more than 64 games in any of his last four seasons as a Piston. On January 15, 1974, Lanier led all scorers in that season's NBA All Star Game with 24 points, and was named the All Star Game MVP. Detroit was a franchise in constant transition. Lanier played under eight coaches in ten seasons: Butch van Breda Kolff , Terry Dischinger , Earl Lloyd , Ray Scott , Herb Brown , Bob Kauffman , Dick Vitale and Richie Adubato . Each coach was hired or fired mid-season. Of his time in Detroit, Lanier said, \"I think '73\u201374 was our best team [52\u201330]. We had Dave [Bing], Stu Lantz, John Mengelt, Chris Ford, Don Adams, Curtis Rowe, George Trapp. But then for some reason, they traded six guys off that team before the following year. I just didn\u2019t feel we ever had the leadership. I think we had [seven] head coaches in my 10 years there. That was a rough time because, at the end of every year, you'd be so despondent.\" In his ten seasons with the Pistons, Lanier averaged a double-double 22.7 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.0 blocks and 1.2 steals in 681 games for Detroit. Lanier is the Pistons' all-time leader in scoring average and ranks second in total rebounds , third in total points and was voted to seven All-Star games. Milwaukee Bucks February 4, 1980, Lanier was traded by the Detroit Pistons to the Milwaukee Bucks for Kent Benson and a 1980 1st round draft pick . On April 20, 1980, Lanier scored 19 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a Game 7 loss against the Seattle SuperSonics in the Western Conference Semifinals . On May 5, 1982, Lanier's 27 points led the Bucks to a Game 5 victory against the Philadelphia 76ers. The Bucks eventually lost the series. It was his highest single post season game points total for the Bucks. In Lanier's five seasons with the Bucks, they won the Midwest Division championship each year under Coach Don Nelson, with Lanier playing alongside teammates Marques Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Quinn Buckner, Junior Bridgeman and Dave Cowens. Still highly effective, with aging knees, Lanier played a key role with the Bucks while averaging nearly 10 minutes less per game in his Milwaukee tenure that he had in Detroit . Of going to Milwaukee, \"I wanted the trade.\" Lanier said. \"I got to Milwaukee... and the people gave me a standing ovation and really made me feel welcome. It was the start of a positive change. I just wish I had played with that kind of talent around me when I was young. But if I had had Marques [Johnson] and Sidney [Moncrief] and all of them around me? Damn.\" Lanier officially retired from the Milwaukee Bucks on September 24, 1984. He cited reoccurring knee injuries as the reason for his retirement. In 278 games with the Bucks, Lanier averaged 26 minutes and 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.0 steals. He played in the 1982 All-Star Game with Milwaukee. During Lanier's five season tenure, the Bucks advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals twice. However, they were not ultimately able to advance to the NBA Finals."

His intensity sometimes spilled over from playing into fighting, knocking out Atlanta's Bob Christian in 1971, and breaking the nose of Detroit's Bill Laimbeer in 1983."

Lanier's knee injuries that plagued his later career have worsened as he has aged, and he has undergone several surgeries since his retirement, as recently as 2017. From 2005 to the present day, Lanier has been the NBA Cares Global Ambassador. Lanier routinely works with youth-serving programs that support education, youth, and family development, and health-related causes. At the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, visitors are able to compare the size of their foot to that of Lanier's. The largest shoe ever created by shoe company Allen Edmonds was a size 22 for Lanier. Lanier was a spokesperson and chairman of the NBA's \"Stay In School\" program from 1989 to 1994. According to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Lanier would smoke cigarettes during halftime breaks. Abdul-Jabbar would try to take advantage of this by forcing Lanier to run more during the second half. In the movie Airplane!, Abdul-Jabbar also references Lanier when he says to little Joey: \"Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes.\" In March 2018, St. Bonaventure won its first game in the NCAA Tournament since 1970, defeating UCLA. Coach Mark Schmidt said, \"It can't get better. Our guys just fought, we persevered. ... In 1970, you know, Bob Lanier got hurt, and didn't have a chance to play UCLA and ... this is for him.\" \u201cWhen I got the job here 11 years ago, we hear the stories about 1970,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd everybody talks about if Lanier was healthy, they would have taken on UCLA. This victory is for those guys.\u201d In September, 2018, Lanier cited one of his most notable NBA memories: \"...when I was still playing in Milwaukee and I was getting gas at a station on, I think it was Center St. A guy came up to me and said, 'My dad is sick. And you\u2019re his favorite player. Could you come up to the house and say hello to him? The house is right next door.' So I went over, I went upstairs. The guy was laying there in his bed. His son said, 'This is Bob,' and he was like, 'I know.' And he just had a little smile, a twinkle in his eye. And he grabbed my hand and squeezed it. And we said a little prayer. About two weeks later, his dad had died. And he left a card at the Bucks office, just saying 'Thank you for making one of my dad\u2019s final days into a good day.'\""

Early in 1999, Konji\u0107 was recruited by Gordon Strachan, manager of English Premiership side Coventry City for a fee of around \u00a32 million. Injuries prevented fans from getting a real glimpse of the player though, as he made just 19 appearances before the club's relegation at the end of the 2000\u201301 season. In the next three seasons, all of which were spent in the Championship. 'Big Mo' made 138 appearances, and scored four goals. During this period, Konji\u0107 had captained the club and became a fan favourite. He was renowned both for his fully committed style of play and also his willingness to bring the ball forward if the midfield and attack were not having any impact. He was sold at the end of the 2003\u201304 season to Derby County by then Sky Blues manager Peter Reid. In the 2004\u201305 season, he made 18 appearances in George Burley's Derby side which reached the Football League Championship play-offs. Injuries have continued to hamper his progress, and he made just one appearance for Derby in the 2005\u201306 season as a result. He was released at the end of the season and subsequently retired from playing."

He won domestic honours with Manchester United and represented England at the World Cup. After a knee injury ended his playing career, he went into management. He has managed several English clubs, most notably Crystal Palace and Reading, both of which he took from the English second tier to achieve each club's greatest-ever successes in the top flight. He has also managed Manchester City, Bristol City, Brighton & Hove Albion, and Brentford.

        "content": "At the age of 18, Coppell attended Quarry Bank High School in south Liverpool, where musician John Lennon and footballer Joe Royle had previously been pupils. Just one year ahead of Coppell were Clive Barker, Les Dennis and Brian Barwick, the chief executive of the FA from January 2005 until the end of 2008. Coppell was a nippy, incisive wide player in his youth but despite interest from some top clubs, he chose to join lower league Merseyside club Tranmere Rovers as he wanted to study for a degree in economic history at the University of Liverpool. By 1974, Coppell was playing for Tranmere, studying for his degree and coaching the university team. But in 1975 his life changed when Manchester United made an offer of \u00a360,000 for him. His prospective new club instantly offered to double his wage and Coppell signed. Coppell was able to complete his degree while charging up and down the right wing for Manchester United, making his debut as a substitute in a 4\u20130 win over Cardiff City on 1 March 1975, as his new club stormed back to the First Division after a season in the Second. Coppell ended that season with ten games under his belt and one goal. The following season, Coppell played 39 times and scored ten goals, one of which was at the Kop end of his boyhood club Liverpool's Anfield ground. He also won honours for the England under-23 team. The exciting young Manchester United team put together by manager Tommy Docherty progressed in the First Division and reached the 1976 FA Cup Final, where they were strong favourites to beat Southampton, who were from the Second Division. But Manchester United's youthful side succumbed to nerves \u2013 Coppell included \u2013 and Southampton's more experienced professionals ran out 1\u20130 winners. Coppell had the first shot of the game, hitting a 25-yard drive straight at the Southampton goalkeeper in the first two minutes. Afterwards, Coppell said: \"I didn't feel too bad, as I appreciated being in the FA Cup final at all. It was only afterwards I realised it might have been the only chance I'd ever get. But the next season gave me another go.\" In 1977, Manchester United fell short in the League but reached the FA Cup final again, where this time they played Liverpool, who were chasing a \"treble\" of First Division championship, FA Cup and European Cup. They had already won the title by the time the two sides met at Wembley, but it was Manchester United who performed on the day and won 2\u20131. Coppell was one of nine players on show who had lost so disappointingly the year before."

        "content": "Later in 1977, Coppell received a call-up to the England team for the country's final qualifying game for the 1978 FIFA World Cup against Italy at Wembley. Coppell played and England won 2\u20130 but the damage had been done earlier in the campaign and England did not qualify for the finals. Coppell stayed in the plans of new England coach Ron Greenwood, playing in a number of friendly matches through 1978 and scoring the only goal of the game \u2013 his first for England \u2013 in a victory over Scotland at Hampden Park. Coppell remained a constant for club and country over the next 12 months, scoring for his country against Czechoslovakia and Northern Ireland while also adding goals from the wing for Manchester United, who reached another FA Cup final in 1979 following a season during which Coppell didn't miss a game. At Wembley awaiting them this time were Arsenal, who were similarly back for another go after surprisingly losing the previous year's game and it seemed as though Coppell was going to emerge a loser for the second time as Arsenal coasted into a 2\u20130 lead. With just four minutes left, Coppell took a free-kick which was diverted into the danger zone by Joe Jordan and swung home by defender Gordon McQueen. Taking heart from this, Manchester United stormed forward in search of an equaliser and when Arsenal were unable to clear the ball properly, Coppell lifted a delightful chipped pass over the defence for Sammy McIlroy to latch on to and beat two Arsenal players before stroking the ball home. With just a minute remaining, United seemed to have forced extra-time and Coppell would later say that he \"had a vision in my head that we would win 4\u20132 in extra-time\" \u2013 but it didn't happen. Arsenal charged forward from the restart and Alan Sunderland scored a goal which won the match. Coppell was in the losing side again. A week later, Coppell had a better experience at Wembley as he scored one and made another as England beat Scotland 3\u20131. He continued to impress for his country while also remaining an ever-present for Manchester United for the next two years. His habit of scoring against Scotland continued in 1980 with a goal in a 2\u20130 win at Hampden prior to the 1980 European Championships, during which he featured in the opening two group matches, though England failed to progress further."

        "content": "Tragedy struck Coppell while playing for England in a vital qualifier for the 1982 FIFA World Cup against Hungary. Coppell was the victim of a vicious high challenge from J\u00f3zsef T\u00f3th which shattered his knee. Coppell said the effect was \"like someone had put a firework in my knee and it had gone off\" and underwent an operation which allowed him a temporary fix so he could carry on playing. Coppell nursed the injury through the 1982 World Cup in Spain, playing in all three of England's group games and the goalless draw against West Germany in the second pool. England went out in the next game against Spain and Coppell underwent a second operation. He continued to play for Manchester United as much as he could after suffering the injury, playing 36 times in the 1981\u201382 season and 29 times in the 1982\u201383 campaign. He made two more appearances for England after the World Cup ended, scoring in the former as England beat Luxembourg 9\u20130. Coppell was fit enough to play in the League Cup final of 1983 which \u2013 in a reverse of events in 1977 \u2013 opponents Liverpool won 2\u20131. But as Manchester United progressed also to the FA Cup final in the same year, Coppell's knee had broken down again and he missed the final against Brighton & Hove Albion, which ended 2\u20132 and ultimately concluded in a 4\u20130 victory for Manchester United in the replay. Another operation followed but to no avail, and Coppell announced his retirement from the game in October 1983, aged just 28. He had broken the record for the most consecutive appearances for an outfield Manchester United player \u2013 207 from 1977 to 1981 \u2013 which still stands to this day. His Manchester United career ended with 373 appearances and 70 goals; his England career had concluded with 42 caps and seven goals. He also scored the quickest recorded goal at under 18 level in a cup final against Notts County. The goal time was 12 seconds. He has since stated that he recently discovered, thanks to advances in technology, that his ACL had only been connected at one end since the tackle, something which had been missed in previous surgeries. He has now had his ACL removed."

        "content": "Crystal Palace In June 1984, Coppell became manager of Crystal Palace. Aged just 28 years and 10 months upon his appointment, he became one of the youngest men to ever manage a club in the Football League. Coppell made budget signings of unwanted players from the First Division, as well as signing Ian Wright from non-league football. The club's fortunes greatly improved, and Palace won promotion to the top flight through the play-offs in 1989. Palace reached the FA Cup final in 1990, losing to Manchester United in a replay, after Coppell's inspired substitution of bringing on Ian Wright nearly won the first game for Palace. Their semi-final victory over Liverpool helped make up for the horrific 9\u20130 drubbing that they had received in a league match at Anfield early in the season. The following season, Crystal Palace finished in third place in the top flight and won the Full Members Cup. The club's fortunes declined after that, and in May 1993, Coppell resigned after they were relegated from the Premier League. However, his name was linked with the England national coach's job six months later when Graham Taylor resigned, but he swiftly ruled out any interest in the job. In May 1994, he was also linked with the manager's job at Middlesbrough, but the job went to his former Manchester United teammate Bryan Robson instead. Crystal Palace Coppell returned to Palace in June 1995 as Director of Football, with Ray Lewington and Peter Nicholas working alongside him as first team coaches. In February 1996, Dave Bassett was appointed manager and the club reached the final of the First Division Play-offs where they lost 2\u20131 to Leicester City after extra time. Manchester City Coppell left Palace in October 1996 to become manager of Manchester City, a job that he would quit after only six games and 33 days in charge. He cited the pressure of the job as his reason for leaving the club. His reign at the club is the shortest of any City manager to date. Crystal Palace After leaving Manchester City, Coppell returned to Palace as Chief Scout. Following the resignation of manager Dave Bassett in February 1997, Coppell was promoted once again to the role of manager. He secured another promotion via the play-offs after only 6 months in the job, and he remained in charge of the club for the first seven months of the 1997\u201398 season. Despite signing the likes of Attilio Lombardo and Tomas Brolin, Crystal Palace struggled. With relegation confirmed, a boardroom takeover by Palace fan Mark Goldberg led to him again becoming Director of Football, with Terry Venables being appointed first team manager. Crystal Palace Following the resignation of manager Terry Venables in January 1999, Coppell once again returned as the manager of Palace. By that time the club had severe financial problems. High earners like Venables and Lombardo had been removed to try and cut spending, and the club was close to going bankrupt. With relegation seeming a realistic possibility, he guided the club to respectable finishes of 14th and 15th in the league. In the 2000 close season Simon Jordan bought the club and replaced Coppell with Alan Smith, who had taken over from Coppell on his first resignation seven years earlier. Jordan said Coppell had done a \"fantastic job\", but the club needed to \"evolve or die\". All in all, Coppell's exploits in SE25, from promotion to the Cup Final, to third place, even to First Division survival, made him a favourite, and in 2005, he was voted as the manager for Palace's Centenary XI. Brentford Coppell was appointed manager of Brentford in 2001 by his former Palace chairman, Ron Noades. It was Brentford's best ever start to a season, losing only once in their first 10 matches, and that was to Sir Bobby Robson's Newcastle United side at St James' Park. Coppell's side spent most of the season behind Brighton & Hove Albion and Reading in the table. Coppell took them to the Division Two play-off final in 2002 after they had narrowly missed out on automatic promotion, conceding a late equaliser to Coppell's future side Reading in the end-of-season decider. They lost in the play-off final to Stoke City. After this, Coppell resigned, citing the club's lack of finances. Brighton & Hove Albion After a brief stint as assistant manager to Andy King at Swindon Town, Coppell took over as manager at Brighton. He fell asleep during his initial job interview, but after a poor start to the season by a Brighton side managed by Martin Hinshelwood, Coppell was given a second chance and took it. Brighton were struggling in Division One and on a 10 match losing streak. During Coppell's first match, Brighton fans were accused of racially taunting referee Phil Prosser after he awarded two penalties against them, which helped Neil Warnock's Sheffield United come from 2\u20131 behind to win. The police, stewards accompanying Mr Prosser and Sheffield United player Peter Ndlovu, who the referee also claimed was abused, all stated that they did not hear any racist abuse. No evidence was found to support Prosser's claim and the FA took no further action. Coppell did get an emotional return to Palace, being applauded into his dugout, despite taking charge of Palace's arch-rivals in the game. Palace won the match 5\u20130. Some Brighton fans accused Coppell of deliberately capitulating which he denied. Although their performances improved, they were relegated on the final day of the season, five points behind Stoke. In the next season, Brighton pushed hard for promotion, but Coppell received a job offer from Reading, which he accepted, despite the Seagulls topping the Division Two table. Coppell cited the apparent lack of progress on the Falmer stadium project, which was a major factor in his decision to join the club. Without a modern stadium, Coppell felt Brighton had little chance of getting to the Premier League, which was where Coppell wanted to be managing. Reading had recently completed the Madejski Stadium, making them an ideal employer. Reading On 9 October 2003, Coppell was appointed manager of Reading, succeeding West Ham bound Alan Pardew . His first season in charge, 2003\u201304, was somewhat hampered by the season's transfer budget already having been spent by his predecessor. His second season in charge began well, and Reading raced to second place in the Championship but a run of eleven matches without a win between Boxing Day 2004 and the 3\u20131 home victory over Pardew's West Ham United on 12 March 2005 helped end their hopes of promotion as they finished seventh, narrowly missing out on a playoff place. Reading dominated the Championship in the 2005\u201306 season, setting a new league record of 33 league games unbeaten between the opening day defeat by Plymouth Argyle and the loss at Luton Town in February; these were the only league defeats the team would suffer that season. On 25 March 2006 they clinched promotion to the top flight for the first time in their 135-year history thanks to a 1\u20131 draw away to Leicester City. Coppell's team secured the league title in the following week, with a 5\u20130 drubbing of Derby County, and they would go on to set a new English league record for the number of points won in a season, with 106. Following such an outstanding season in charge of Reading, Coppell was voted League Managers Association's Manager of the Year for both the Championship and the entire league, and he also topped the Tissot League For Managers' Performance. On 26 March 2007, Coppell broke with his usual tradition and signed a new two-year contract to keep him as Reading's manager until the end of the 2008\u201309 season. Coppell is well known for not voicing controversial opinions, but he broke with this habit on 9 April 2007, when he accused Charlton's Talal El Karkouri of cheating and faking a \"death roll\" to get Leroy Lita sent off after Lita appeared to headbutt him. Lita received a 3 match ban for the incident. Reading finished their first season in the English top flight in eighth place, just one point short of UEFA Cup qualification. In recognition of this performance, Coppell won the Manager of the Year award for the second season in succession. Speaking earlier in the season, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said of Coppell: \"I think it's totally deserved. It's a marvellous contribution he's made. And what's encouraging for the Premiership is that it's mostly British-based players in his side, with some Irish players thrown in. I think that says a lot for the way he has gathered his team together\". Reading's second season was not as good as their first season and it ended in relegation back to the Championship. Coppell said he would consider his future as Reading manager. However, at a press conference on 20 May 2008 he cited the fans as an important factor in committing his future to the club for the 2008\u201309 season. Unusually for a club just relegated, Reading fans were so concerned that Coppell may feel honour-bound to resign that they launched a successful protest to convince Coppell to stay at the club. Their initial form was promising, with Reading playing the free flowing football that got them promoted in record-breaking fashion in 2005\u201306. Reading equalled their highest win under Coppell with a 6\u20130 victory over Sheffield Wednesday. They also beat the then league leaders Wolves 3\u20130 at Molineux. The latter half of the season was less impressive however, particularly at home where they failed to win a single match after January. Eventually they finished the league in 4th place after failing to secure a win against Birmingham that would have seen them promoted automatically. In Coppell's final game in charge, Reading lost their playoff semi-final against Burnley. He resigned as manager immediately after the game. Bristol City On 22 April 2010 Coppell was named as the new manager of Bristol City, with former caretaker manager Keith Millen staying on as his assistant. He began a 12-month rolling contract with the club on 11 May 2010 but, on 11 August 2010 after only four months in charge, Coppell resigned as Bristol City manager, saying that he would retire from football management altogether citing a lack of passion for the job. However, on 9 September 2011 he admitted that he was interested in becoming the next manager of Iceland. He has previously coached Icelandic players such as Brynjar Bj\u00f6rn Gunnarsson, \u00cdvar Ingimarsson and Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson. Crawley Town On 10 April 2012, Coppell was announced as the Director of Football at Crawley Town. The appointment was made days after previous manager Steve Evans left to manage Rotherham United, with former assistant manager Craig Brewster placed in temporary charge. Coppell continued in his role when Richie Barker was appointed as the new manager. On 2 December 2013, following the departure of Barker, Coppell left his position as director of football. Portsmouth After the dismissal of Guy Whittingham on 25 November, Portsmouth appointed Richie Barker as the new manager. Coppell joined his former Crawley Town colleague as Director of Football on 9 December, with the club sitting 17th in the table. On 27 March 2014, following the departure of Barker, Coppell left his position as director of football. Kerala Blasters On 21 June 2016, Coppell was announced as the manager of Kerala Blasters FC in 2016 Indian Super League. His team secured a spot in the finals after finishing second in the league matches with 22 points. Kerala Blasters lost the final in spite of getting the lead as ATK came from behind and then won on penalties by 4\u20133 in Kerala's home stadium. On 12 July 2017, it was announced that Coppell would not return to the Kerala Blasters for the 2017\u201318 season. Jamshedpur FC On 14 July 2017, it was announced that Coppell would become the first head coach of the ISL side Jamshedpur. ATK After spending just one season with Jamshedpur, Coppell moved once again to another Indian Super League club, ATK, on 18 June 2018. Unfortunately his new season with ATK started with a 2\u20130 defeat to one of his former clubs Kerala Blasters under coaching of David James in their own home. ATK finished 6th and failed to reach the playoffs again. In the Indian Super Cup 2019 ATK reached the semifinals but lost to Chennaiyin FC. After that he was sacked."

They joined the Grantham & District League the following season. The club later returned to the Midland Amateur Alliance, where they played until becoming founder members of the Central Alliance in 1911 alongside Grantham Avenue. In 1924\u201325 they were Central Alliance champions, also winning Division B of the Subsidiary Competition. Grantham then moved up to the Midland League. In 1928\u201329 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time since the Victorian era, and after beating Rhyl Athletic 1\u20130, they lost 2\u20131 at Third Division North club Wigan Borough. In 1933 they joined the new Central Combination, but after finishing second-from-bottom of the league in its first season, they returned to the Midland League. The club qualified for the first round again in 1935\u201336, losing 2\u20130 at home to Notts County. The 1937\u201338 season saw the club finish the season as Midland League runners-up.

In the third round they lost 2\u20130 at home to Second Division Middlesbrough in front of a record crowd of 6,578. In 1977\u201378 the club finished bottom of the Southern League Premier Division and were relegated to Division One North. The following season saw them win the division. As well as being promoted, the club were also transferred to the Northern Premier League. However, after being relegated at the end of the 1984\u201385 season, they were transferred back to the Southern League and placed in the Midland Division. In 1987 the club was renamed Grantham Town. They were Midland Division champions in 1997\u201398, earning promotion to the Premier Division. The club were relegated again at the end of the 1999\u20132000 season, this time of the Eastern Division.

He participated in the inaugural Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament in 1993, held at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, Scotland, in which his Australian team lost to England 17\u201321 in the final. In 1998, he captained Australia to its first rugby sevens tournament victory in ten years at the Paris Sevens. He captained the Australian rugby sevens team at the 1998 Commonwealth Games to a bronze medal. In 2015, the Hong Kong Rugby Football Union announced Campese as one of seven members of 'The Hong Kong Magnificent Sevens', the HKRFU's commemorative campaign to recognise the seven most formative players to have played in the past 40 Years of Sevens in Hong Kong. He is famous for his \"goose-step\" \u2014 a hitch-kick motion which left opponents stumbling to try to tackle him."

Following this announcement, David Campese was selected for the 1982 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand. Following the Wallabies first tour match against Taranaki in New Plymouth, David Campese debuted for the Wallabies in a match against Manawatu in Palmerston North, in which he scored a solo try and kicked three goals from five attempts in a 26\u201310 victory. He played in the following game against Hawke's Bay at Napier and, two matches later, was chosen for his first Test. Australia 18 \u2013 New Zealand 33 Campese played a central part in one of the biggest talking points of the third and final Test. The Wallabies set a scoring record for an Australian rugby union tour of New Zealand by scoring 316 points in 14 matches, including 47 tries. This surpassed the achievement of the 1972 Australian team, which scored 229 in 13 matches. Australian sportswriter Jack Pollard documented that Campese \"scored eight tries in nine games, kicked four goals and two penalties for a total of 48 points.\" This included a try and three successful goals kicked from five attempts in his debut match against Manawatu, two tries and a conversion in the Wallabies's 11th tour game against Bay of Plenty , and 13 points against North Auckland at Whangarei in the Wallabies final game prior to the third Test of the series , in which Campese scored two tries, a penalty and a conversion, before being named 'man of the match'. Campese was also deprived of a try in the Wallabies' 12th match on tour against Counties when Counties' player Alan Dawson, shoved Campese in the back and away from the ball before he could touch it down. A photograph of Dawson's shove is published in Bob Dwyer's autobiography The Winning Way, in which Dwyer asserts that Dawson \"cost Campo the try and the Wallabies the match\"."

He played in 10 of the 18 tour matches, including all four Tests against the Home Nations and the final match against the Barbarians. He scored six tries on tour, more than any other Australian player - two of them in the final Test match against Scotland. Campese played on the right wing in Australia's first tour match against London Division, won 22\u20133. He was switched to fullback for the Wallabies' second tour match against South and South West Division, drawn 12-12, and then rested for the third match of the tour against Cardiff with James Black selected at fullback and Ross Hanley on the wing. He returned to the side for Australia's fourth match on tour against Combined Services, in which he scored three tries and made the final pass for two more tries, scored by Bill Campbell and Andrew Slack, in an eight-try 44\u20139 victory. Campese was then rested for the Wallabies fifth match on tour, and their final match before the first Test against England, won 17\u20137 against Swansea . Following Australia's first Test victory against England , Campese was rested for the seventh match on tour against Midlands Division. Australia were scheduled to play Ireland the weekend following their Test against England, and Wallabies coach Alan Jones opted to select a second-string side that defeated Midlands Division 21\u201318. Following Australia's second Test victory on tour against Ireland , Campese came-on as a late replacement in Australia's 9\u201316 loss to Ulster. Replacing James Black, Campese \"set up another try with his first touch.\" Terry Cooper reports that, \"He sliced through the defence, Hawker and Lynagh moved the ball on briskly and Grigg scored easily.\" However, Ulster's winning penalty was kicked following a penalty awarded against Campese. Campese was rested for the next two tour matches against Munster and Llanelli , prior to the Wallabies' third tour Test against Wales, won 28\u20139. Some time between Australia's second Test victory over Ireland and its third Test over Wales, Campese fell ill with the flu. Following the third Test of the tour against Wales, Campese scored a try in the final minutes of Australia's 19\u201312 victory over Northern Division - his fourth try on tour. The match against Northern Division was Campese's last provincial match on tour. Australia lost to South of Scotland 6-9 and defeating Glasgow 26-12 prior to its final Test against Scotland, won 35\u201312. Australia then defeated Pontpool 21\u201318 in their final provincial match prior to the tour-closing match against the Barbarians. The match against the Barbarians featured what Campese regards as one of his four greatest performances playing for the Wallabies. Australia 19 \u2013 England 3 The Wallabies had a nervy start in the game against , the first international test of the Grand Slam tour. Campese almost scored early on by chasing a high kick from Michael Lynagh. Australia settled later on after tries from Ella and Lynagh, before Campese was to make a break down the left leading to a try. With 14 minutes left in the Test, Australia's left wing Brendan Moon suffered a broken arm in a tackle. Australian winger Matt Burke replaced Moon, moving to the right wing, and shifting Campese to play on the left wing. In For Love Not Money Australian flanker Simon Poidevin recalls that, \"For the last of our three tries I was tailing Campese down the touchline like a faithful sheepdog when he tossed me an overhead pass and over I went to score the Twickenham try every kid dreams of.\" Australia 28 \u2013 Wales 9 As Australian number 8 Steve Tuynman took the ball from the back of the scrum, he searched for Nick Farr-Jones, utilising the blind under Alan Jones' command. Farr-Jones occupied Campese opposite winger and passed the ball to him, allowing Campese to run along the left wing. At the start of his run, Campese ran past Butler, who was unable to make the defending tackle. But Campese's run was not over yet, he swerved past the Welsh fullback, and executed a wonderful sidestep to get past the Welsh inside center. Campese's sidestep led him toward a group of defenders, so he then offloaded to Simon Poidevin, who quickly passed the ball to Michael Lynagh who scored an easy try under the post. Australia won 28\u20139. Australia 37 \u2013 Scotland 12 Campese scored two tries in the Test against Scotland \u2013 the first tries Campese scored at Test level on the 1984 Tour to the United Kingdom. Australia 37 \u2013 Barbarians 30 Australia played against the Barbarians one week after winning the Grand Slam. That match is perhaps best remembered for David Campese's zig-zagging run that turned Welsh centre Robert Ackerman inside out in the process, before Campese, opting not to run past Ackerman in the process of confounding him, but rather offered himself to be tackled before passing the ball to Michael Hawker for a try. Campese received praise for other moments in this game."

        "content": "Campese was a member of the 1986 Australia Wallabies that defeated the New Zealand All Blacks in New Zealand. The 1986 Australia Wallabies became the second Australian rugby team to beat the New Zealand All Blacks in New Zealand in a rugby union Test series. They are one of six rugby union teams to win a rugby Test series in New Zealand, along with the 1937 South African Springboks, the 1949 Australian Wallabies, the 1971 British Lions, the 1994 French touring side, and the 2009 French touring team . Campese played fullback in the first two Tests of the 1986 Test series versus New Zealand, before being moved to wing in the final Test. 1st Test: Australia 13 \u2013 New Zealand 12 Three moments involving David Campese are frequently recorded in reports of the first Test against New Zealand in 1986. Rugby journalist Terry Smith records in Path to Victory that: In spite of having the wind advantage, it took twenty-two minutes for Australia to break the spirited All Black defensive line with a try by fullback David Campese, his twentieth in twenty-five Tests. From a scrum win, Nick Farr-Jones made a glorious break on the open side, stumbled, and when tackled, Campese was there with razor-sharp reactions to toe the ball over the line and dive on it for a try that gave Lynagh a simple conversion.\" Jenkins documents Campese's involvement in Australia's second try in Wallaby Gold by writing that, \"From Farr-Jones, the ball spun to Brett Papworth, then to Campese, who held up the pass until winger John Kirwan was lured infield from Burke. Campese then tossed the ball to Burke, who pulled it in to have a clear run to the corner.\" Peter Jenkins records that, \"Campese, having scored one try and created another, had a significant role in the third, this time for the All Blacks. His infield pass when tackled near halfway finished in the arms of All Black centre Joe Stanley. He swept downfield and, when taken by Lynagh, slipped a pass to flanker Mark Brooke-Cowden for the try.\" 2nd Test: Australia 12 \u2013 New Zealand 13 Australia lost the second Bledisloe Cup Test of 1986 to New Zealand 12\u201313. Following the Test, claims were made that Australian coach Alan Jones made derogatory remarks about Campese's performance, after the fullback dropped a few 'high-kicks' in very wet conditions. In On A Wing and a Prayer Campese asserted that later that day during the night-time he visited Jones in his hotel room and tried to apologise for his mistakes, which resulted in a verbal barrage of insults from Jones which lasted many minutes. Jones is reported to have told Campese that, \"I told the papers you were the Bradman of rugby - now you've let me down.\" Nick Farr-Jones is reported to have overheard the conversation between Campese and Alan Jones, before he entered the room and attempted to calm the situation. In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese recalled that: \"I left that room feeling hurt and humiliated. I did something I virtually never do, as I said much earlier: I went out and got drunk. Outside in the Dunedin night the rain was trickling down the windows and the wind was blowing. It was cold and horrible, which exactly reflected my mood. The drops of rain on the windows could have been tears in my soul.\" In David Campese Gordon Bray wrote that: \"So distraught was he in a nightclub a few hours later, that he declared he was ready to retire from rugby. It was distressing to see such a gifted athlete and entertainer so despondent and agitated. The world's rugby enthusiasts can be grateful that Mark Ella consoled his teammate that night.\" Years later in Wallaby Gold: The History of Australian Test Rugby Alan Jones contested the accusations of slander saying: 3rd Test: Australia 22 \u2013 New Zealand 9 In Path to Victory: Wallaby Power in the 1980s the Daily Mirror's Terry Smith writes that, \"One very famous player was in danger of losing his Test spot in New Zealand until his team-mates urged Jones to retain him.\" Australian coach Alan Jones selected Campese on the wing for the final test instead of fullback. This Test marked the first time David Campese opposed All Black winger John Kirwan. Kirwan had missed the 1984 Bledisloe series due to injury. Campese had missed the 1985 Bledisloe Cup Test due to injury."

        "content": "In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese wrote that, \"the first-ever World Cup, in 1987, was ultimately a disaster both for Australia and for me personally.\" Campese played throughout the entire 1987 World Cup impeded by injury. Campese missed a pre-World Cup Test match against South Korea in Brisbane on 17 May 1987 due to injury. However, he made a successful return to the Wallabies for their first World Cup pool match against England. World Cup Pool Match: Australia 19 \u2013 England 6 Campese was involved in the biggest controversy of his first World Cup game against England. Rugby writer Peter Jenkins in Wallaby Gold records that, \"It took 10 minutes into the second half for Australia to score their first try, a controversial one, when Campese went across. He placed the ball on the knee of English rival Rory Underwood before it bounced away and Lynagh grounded it over the English line. But referee Keith Lawrence had already awarded the try to Campese... Campese later confessed that, \"The chief talking-point was the fact that I was awarded a try which I never touched down properly. It was not a score. It you study the video, it is obvious that I was not happy with the decision the referee made...\" Campese's defence in this Test was later criticised by Australian coach Alan Jones. World Cup Pool Match: Australia 47 \u2013 USA 21 In Wallaby Gold: The History of Australian Test Rugby rugby writer Peter Jenkins documents that, \"...individually, there had been some impressive moments. Winger Campese, criticised the week before by Jones for indifferent defence, received after this game a one-word endorsement from the coach: 'Fantastic.' Campese scored a try, his 23rd, just one short of the world record, and produced an inspired flick pass for halfback Brian Smith to cross. World Cup Pool Match: Australia 42 \u2013 Japan 23 Playing at fullback, Campese scored his 24th Test try in Australia's World Cup pool match against Japan, equaling the then world record for tries with Ian Smith of Scotland . World Cup Quarter-Final: Australia 33 \u2013 Ireland 15 World Cup Semi-Final: Australia 24 \u2013 France 30 Campese has called the 1987 World Cup semi-final, played between Australia and France, the most memorable Test he ever played for Australia. In On a Wing and a Prayer he described it as \"a great game of rugby, one of the very best in which I have ever played. Sensational things, like brilliant scores, started to happen in that game and we just carried on from there.\" Campese scored his world record 25th Test try six minutes into the second half of the semi-final, surpassing Scotland winger Ian Smith's 54-year-old record for most international Test tries. In Blindsided Michael Lynagh documented how Campese scored his world-record try. \"My dummy to wrong-foot Franck Mesnel and a step inside Philippe Sella [Note: It was Pierre Berbizier] set up a break deep inside French territory,\" Lynagh wrote. \"As he usually did, Campo showed up at the end of the move to score in the corner after Peter Grigg popped the ball inside to him.\" Campese later wrote that, \"I was blamed for letting a kick from the French left wing, Patrice Lagisquet, bounce late in our semi-final against France at the Concord Oval, and the French picked up the loose ball to go on and score after a bewildering movement involving 11 passes. However, he later explained that, \"The reason I did not catch Lagisquet's kick ahead near the end, when the scores were level at 24-24, was that I slipped in the mud trying to reach it.\" In Campo: Still Entertaining, Campese offered the following reflection of the 1987 Rugby World Cup semi-final. \"In 1987, there were just 18,000 people to watch us lose, at the death,\" he recalled, \"a Test match still hailed as one of the greatest ever played.\" World Cup Play-Off For Third: Australia 21- Wales 22 1987 Bledisloe Cup Test Campese continued his injury-impeded 1987 season by playing in the one-off Bledisloe Cup Test of 1987, a month after the 1987 Rugby World Cup. Campese played on the right wing, and did not oppose his archrival John Kirwan in this Test. In My Game Your Game Campese writes that, \"It was not a memorable month or two, and later in the year I had to drop out of a major Wallaby tour for the one and only time in my career, when an x-ray of my ankle before we went to Argentina revealed the bone had cracked in half.\""

        "content": "Australia were easily beaten in the 1988 Bledisloe Cup. Campese marked All Black winger John Kirwan for all three Tests in the series. Kirwan scored four tries in the series. Campese later confessed that Kirwan's excellent performances against him affected his confidence, such that his mother sent him a poem titled Winners Take Chances. For the rest of his career, Campese would read that poem before every Test he played in. In the tribute book David Campese, Campese wrote of Kirwan that, \"John Kirwan was another winger I really admired. He was a strong aggressive player, and he got the better of me quite a few times. With the ball in his hands JK was very determined. He had a job to do and it did not matter who was in front of him.\" Kirwan is recorded saying of Campese that, \"It was difficult and daunting to play him because he had all the tricks. I tried to intimidate him as much as I could by getting close to him before I'd step and using my physicality against him.\" Australia 7 - New Zealand 32 In the first Test of the 1988 Bledisloe Cup New Zealand scored three tries in the opening 12 minutes of the match. In the opening minutes of the game, Australian fullback Andrew Leeds failed to catch a high kick, the ball fell to All Black prop Steve McDowell, who ran past Campese to score a try. John Kirwan scored his first try of the Test in the eighth minute by running past Campese, after All Black flyhalf Grant Fox called a double cut-out pass. Kirwan scored a second time in the 12th minute after an overlap had been created for him. New Zealand led Australia 14\u20134 at halftime. Michael Lynagh kicked Australia's last points shortly after halftime to make the score 14\u20137, before the All Blacks rushed ahead to win the Test 32\u20137. The loss was the then heaviest defeat the All Blacks had achieved against the Wallabies since the third Test of 1972 in Auckland, won by New Zealand 38\u20133. Australia 19 - New Zealand 19 Following the Wallabies first Test defeat, the Australian team management planned to move Campese to the fullback position for the second Test, replacing Andrew Leeds. However, Australian flyhalf Michael Lynagh injured himself with a badly corked thigh in the second half of Queensland's 12\u201327 loss to the All Blacks, leaving Australia without a recognised goal-kicker. Randwick player Lloyd Walker was then selected at flyhalf, Leeds was reinstated at fullback so Australia could have a goal-kicker to replace Lynagh, and Campese moved back to the left-wing position. Australia rushed to a 16-6 half-time lead. However, a try to John Kirwan, his third Test try in the series, brought New Zealand back into the Test. The final score of 19-19 was the only time the All Blacks did not win a game of rugby from 1987 until late 1990."

Campese scored 15 tries on tour and achieved a personal total of 72 points. The form of the Australian team suffered in the early stages of the tour, with Australia losing three of its first six provincial matches, before losing the first Test on tour to England. Following the Test loss to England, Australia went undefeated for the remainder of the tour. While Australia struggled in the early stages of the tour, Campese's form was lauded by British critics. Campese played in Australia's first match on tour, lost 10\u201321 against London. In the second game on tour against Northern Division, lost 9-15, Campese scored a try in the early stages on the game. Campese scored three tries in a 37\u20139 victory over England B - Australia's third match on tour. Campese, along with Wallaby captain Nick Farr-Jones, was then rested and selected on the bench for Australia's fourth match on tour, a 10\u201316 loss to South-West Division. Bolstered by the return of Michael Lynagh to the Australia national rugby union team, Campese regained selection for Australia's fifth provincial game against Midlands Division, in which he was instrumental in setting-up Brad Girvan for a try in the 60th minute. In the sixth match on tour against England Students, Campese scored two tries, kicked three conversions and two penalties, scoring 20 points in a 36\u201313 victory. Campese played in Australia's ninth match on tour against South of Scotland. The Sydney Morning Herald rugby writer Greg Growden reported that, \"Australia fully deserved to be 23-0 ahead at halftime after well-crafted tries by Niuqila, Gourley and David Campese, who left the field in the 30th minute with a slight groin strain.\" Campese was then rested for the 10th match on tour against North and Midlands of Scotland with Australian team management electing a side composed almost entirely of players who didn't play in Australia's victory over South of Scotland. Following Australia's 32\u201313 victory over Scotland, Campese was rested for the Wallabies 12th game on tour against the Combined Services. Australia 19 \u2013 England 28 Campese played Australia's first Test of the tour, a 19-28 loss to England at Twickenham. In the fourth minute of the second half, Campese scored a try , and Australia's second try of the game when he intercepted a Jonathan Webb pass to sprint 70 metres for a try, to give Australia a 13-9 lead. Jenkins writes that, \"Australia scored three tries to England's four \u2013 including a 70-metre intercept effort from Campese...\" Australia 32 \u2013 Scotland 13 Campese scored two tries in a 32\u201313 victory over the Scottish rugby team, in which Australia scored five tries to Scotland's two. Former Wallaby captain Andrew Slack, author of Noddy: The Official Biography of Michael Lynagh, wrote that, \"Australia won 32-13 and although Lynagh was successful with only five kicks from eleven attempts, two delicate chip kicks provided tries for David Campese and ensured the restoration of Australia's rugby reputation.\" Slack further wrote that, \"Campese had been the undoubted star of the tour, and that was made clear by the four youngsters who ran up and down the Murrayfield pitch after the game waving a large banner reading 'David Campese Walks on Water.' Australia 40 \u2013 22 Barbarians Campese concluded the 1988 Australia rugby union tour of England, Scotland and Italy with three tries against Italy in Rome."

The series is perhaps best known for \"Campo's Corner\" - a mistake Campese made in the third and deciding Test in the series. 2nd Test: Australia 12 \u2013 British Lions 19 In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese documents that, \"...the second Test was a disaster for us. We still led the Lions 12-9 with under five minutes remaining, but we had been badly put off our game. The Lions had done that, plainly and simply, by intimidating us.\" 3rd Test: Australia 18 - British Lions 19 In the first half of the series-deciding Test Campese recovered the rugby ball in-goal and successfully 'dummied' past Lions' winger Ieuan Evans, ran the ball beyond Australia's 22, and obtained a large territorial gain for Australia. Campese's error made the scoreline 12\u201313, following Gavin Hastings missed conversion, costing Australia four points. The Lions forwards took over the Test, and surged ahead to a 19\u201312 lead. Following Campese's famous mistake, the Wallabies had an attacking opportunity from set-piece play, and Michael Lynagh called a move that, if executed properly, would have led to Campese scoring under the posts. 1989 Bledisloe Cup Test Campese played in the one-off Bledisloe Cup Test in 1989 between Australia and New Zealand. The Test, which Australia lost 12\u201324. In the 15th minute of the first half of the Test, All Blacks flyhalf Grant Fox kicked the ball downfield on his non-preferred left foot. Australian right winger Ian Williams fielded the ball while running backwards and counterattacked toward the centre of the ground. New Zealand prop Richard Loe caught Williams with a high tackle and a ruck was formed. From the ruck, Nick Farr-Jones moved the ball to the left-side of the Wallabies' attack by passing the ball to Steve Tuynman. Tuynman moved the ball along to Campese on the wing, who stepped around John Kirwan causing him to slip over. Campese then passed to Farr-Jones who had looped both him and Tuynman. As Farr-Jones and Campese were running down the sideline, and with Farr-Jones about to be tackled into touch, Campese pointed forwards, signalling Farr-Jones to kick the ball forwards. Farr-Jones executed a grubber kick. Campese and All Blacks inside centre John Schuster were engaged in a sprint towards the ball. As Schuster tried to dive on the ball, Campese was able to kick the ball forwards and fall upon it to score a try in the 15th minute of the game, which was converted to level the scores at 6-6."

The two-Test series marked what would be the start of five consecutive Tests that Australia would play against France from 1989 to 1990. The 1989 Australia rugby union tour was the first major overseas tour that new Wallabies' centre Tim Horan would undertake with Campese. Australia 32 \u2013 France 15 In the first Test in Strasbourg, France suffered what was then its biggest defeat on its soil with a score of 32 to 15. It was also Australia's then highest score against France and their biggest ever winning margin against France. Following a halftime score of 10\u201312, Australia scored three of its four tries in the second half. In the 62nd minute of the Test, Campese stopped a French backline movement with a tackle on St\u00e9phane Weller, that forced his opposite winger to \"knock the ball on\". The game continued with an Australian attacking scrum, from which Nick Farr-Jones executed a box-kick that wasn't properly fielded by French winger St\u00e9phane Weller. Campese toed the ball forward and followed it. He kicked the ball forward again and was able to fall on it score Australia's third try in the 63rd minute of the game.  Campese was involved in Australia's fourth and final try of the Test during the final play of the game. He occupied French centre Philippe Sella with a goosestep, before delivering the final pass to Tim Horan who scored his second try in the Test. Former Australian rugby union captain Nick Farr-Jones later described Australia's 1989 Test in Strasbourg as his favourite moment as an international rugby union player. Five Australian players made their Test debut: Jason Little, Brendon Nasser, Peter FitzSimons, Rod McCall, and Darren Junee . Australian hooker Phil Kearns, prop Tony Daly, and centre Tim Horan played their second Tests for Australia in that Test.

        "content": "In 1990 Campese was dropped from an Australian Test side for the first time since his debut for the Wallabies in New Zealand on the 1982 tour. Campese was omitted because he did not return early enough from Italy and therefore Australian selectors could not assess his form in a club match. 2nd Test: Australia 48 \u2013 France 31 Campese returned for the second Test against France, won 48\u201331, in what Australian Rugby Union president Joe French described as the best Test match of rugby he had ever seen. The match was later described by Wallaby flanker Simon Poidevin as \"a breathtaking 48-31 victory\" which \"will go down in history as one of the finest ever played\". Australia's points tally of 48 was a then record for the Wallabies against an International Rugby Board member country. The try count of six, which included a penalty try, was also the highest number of tries scored against a fellow IRB country.\" Campese was involved in Australia's second try of the game, which came from a refereeing mistake. In the eighth minute of the Test, Nick Farr-Jones made a break near the half-way line. As he was chased down by Franck Mesnel, he hoisted a forward pass to Campese, running from fullback. Campese set himself to kick a high ball that tested French winger Lacombe. Australian prop Ewen McKenzie pressured Lacombe, the ball came loose and was 'soccered' forward by debutant centre Paul Cornish into the French in-goal, where he fell onto the ball to score a try. David Campese was involved in a controversial refereeing decision that led to France's second try. Australia had an attacking scrum inside France's 22. Michael Lynagh threw a loose pass that hit the ground. After Wallaby winger Ian Williams recovered the ball, he lofted an inside pass that was intercepted by France flyhalf Didier Camberabero who sprinted down the field. As Nick Farr-Jones chased Camberabero down in cover-defence, Camberabero offloaded a pass to French winger Lacombe. While Lacombe approached the Australian try-line, Campese was able to tackle him and successfully dislodge the ball before it was touched down. Referee Clive Norling was unsighted and awarded the try. Perhaps the most well-documented moment of the Test came when French fullback Serge Blanco beat a Campese tackle to score a try. Simon Poidevin recalls that, \"...the one memory which stands out is the amazing try scored by Serge Blanco. Taking the ball on his own line, the French captain sliced between Carozza and Little on the quarter line before swerving past Campese at halfway. Then Blanco beat Williams, Carozza and Campese in the run to the line to score one of the greatest individual tries of all time.\" In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese selected Blanco at fullback in his greatest international XV of all-time team, writing that, \"In 1990 we played France in a three-Test series at home before a tour of New Zealand, and Serge scored one of the greatest international tries during the second game in Brisbane. He carried the ball about 80m for the score and never once looked like he was getting out of second gear. Because of that languid running style, Blanco was deceptively quick, as we found out that afternoon...\" However, Campese would score the final try of the Test by running past Blanco. Australia had a scrum inside France's 22 in front of the goal-posts. Campese stood on the left-hand attacking side of the scrum. As Farr-Jones took the ball from the back of the scrum and started to run to the right, Campese followed Nick Farr-Jones. Nick Farr-Jones shaped to pass the ball to Australian eightman Tim Gavin, which held-up Blanco and French eightman Olivier Roumat. Nick Farr-Jones passed to Campese, who ran through a gap and past Blanco before evading Roumat coming across in cover defence, to score a try untouched. In Noddy: The Authorised Biography of Michael Lynagh, Slack documented Clive Norling's reaction to Campese's final try. \"As Lynagh lined up for goal, there was Norling nattering away in the background,\" Slack documented. \"'Great swerve by Campese. Good advantage played there, boyo.'\" 3rd Test: Australia 19 \u2013 France 28 Campese returned to the fullback role for the third Test against France - a game that marked his 50th Test for Australia. He became the second person, after Simon Poidevin, to reach this milestone. Australia lost the Test to France 19\u201328. Campese scored his 36th Test try from a second-phase play. Michael Lynagh looped Tim Horan, passed the ball to Jason Little who made a line-break and passed the ball to an unmarked Campese in open space who scored the try. 1990: Australia 67 \u2013 U.S.A. 9 Prior to Australia's 1990 three-Test tour to New Zealand, Australia played a one-off Test against the US, in which Campese played. The Test contains the only instance in Campese's career where he successfully completed a drop-goal. Campese also scored a try."

        "content": "David Campese was named Player of the Tournament for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. He was the tournament's equal leading try scorer along with Jean-Baptiste Lafond with six. French rugby newspaper Midi-Olimpique named Campese number one in its World Rugby Top 10. Moreover, Campese was voted the 1991 Australian Society of Rugby Writers Player of the Year, winning the award by a record margin by scoring 64 points, 39 points more than John Eales in second place with 25. Jack Pollard wrote that \"it was the genius of David Campese that made Australia world champions.\" Australia's captain for the 1991 World Cup, Nick Farr-Jones, stated that without Campese, Australia might not have won the World Cup. 1991 World Cup Pool Match \u2013 Australia 32 \u2013 19 Argentina Australia started the 1991 Rugby World Cup with a pool match against , in which Campese scored two tries and created a third. 1991 World Cup Pool Match \u2013 Australia 9 \u2013 Western Samoa 3 Campese played in Australia's second World Cup Pool Match against Western Samoa on the right wing, in which he became the first person to play 60 Test matches for Australia. Australia defeated Western Samoa by scoring three penalty goals to one penalty goal kicked by Western Samoa. 1991 World Cup Pool Match \u2013 Australia 38 \u2013 Wales 3 1991 World Cup Quarter Final \u2013 Australia 19 \u2013 Ireland 18 Campese scored the first try of the Test in the first half of the World Cup Quarter Final off a backline move Campese scored his second try off a move entitled \"cut-two-loop\", a move Australia also called in the final moments of the quarter-final to score a Test-winning try. With five minutes left in the Test, a defensive lapse from Campese led to an Irish try which gave them an 18\u201315 lead. In the final minutes of the Test, Australia trailing 15\u201318, Australia kicked off long. Irish scrum-half Rob Saunders \"sliced his kick badly\", about \"fifteen metres\" \"inside their twenety-two.\" Australia won the ensuing line-out. Australia \"got the put-in to the scrum on the left-hand side of the field\" Lynagh called \"cut-two-loop\" one more time. Lynagh scored the Test-winning try, and Australia won 19\u201318. 1991 World Cup Semi Final \u2013 Australia 16 \u2013 6 New Zealand Campese's performance in the 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final has been described by former Australian coach Bob Dwyer as Campese's signature Test in his career. In an ABC documentary entitled The Rise and Rise of Australian Rugby Dwyer stated that, \"I must say that throughout the 1991 World Cup, and this semi-final match in particular, Campo was a standout performer. We all know what a great player he was over such a long period of time, but I'm sure that his first-half performance that day has never been beaten.\" Prior to the start of the Test, Campese did not stand in-front of the haka, instead opting to practice his kicking downfield. Australia defeated New Zealand 16\u20136 in the 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final, in which Campese was a decisive factor. Rugby writer Philip Derriman records that, \"David Campese made two stunning interventions in the play which produced the only tries of the match and thus were responsible for Australia's 16-6 win.\" Rugby writer Peter Jenkins records that, \"Campese scored the first Wallaby try in the 12th minute [Note: It was the 6th minute], drifting off the blind wing into the five-eighth position to take the first pass from the ruck. He then angled across field to turn his archrival, John Kirwan, inside out before touching down. In the 35th minute he gathered a chip-kick from Lynagh, avoided one defender and drew two others before lobbing a basketball pass, without looking, over his right shoulder for centre Horan to score.\" Greg Growden in the Sydney Morning Herald documented Campese's performance by writing that, \"Campese scored possibly the most exhilarating solo try of the tournament, and inspired another team try which was possibly even better, to prove he is the best attacking player in the world, and definitely the best competitor of this World Cup. Campese is the Pel\u00e9 of world Rugby.\" In Running Rugby Mark Ella wrote of Campese's pass to Tim Horan that, \"Campese's over-the-shoulder pass to Tim Horan in the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand in 1991 must be ranked as close to the ultimate of its type. I cannot think of another player in the world who could have managed it.\" A description of Campese's try is further illustrated in the same book: \"Campese's famous over-the-shoulder pass to Tim Horan in the 1991 World Cup semi-final. Having beaten the New Zealand fullback, Campese succeeds in committing his opposite number, John Timu, by running straight at him, then steps in-field and draws the other two defenders. Having thus brilliantly succeeded in committing the only three All Blacks in a position to defend, Campese flicks a pass over his shoulder to Tim Horan, who now has the space to run around Timu.\"\" Following the Test All Blacks co-coach Alex Wyllie remarked, \"There's always Campo, and when you've got a player like that in your team you always know probably something is going to happen. He did it again \u2013 he just pulled that one out. An individual like that: one day he could probably blow it, but the other four days he could make it. It was just unfortunate he made it against us.\" In the documentary John Kirwan: Running on Instinct, New Zealand's other co-coach John Hart praised Campese. \"David Campese was the star of the first half and he played brilliant rugby,\" he said. \"And, you know, it needs something special in the game like this to break, and he broke it on two occasions.\" John Kirwan reflected in the same documentary that: \"Campo! Campo was awesome, you know. He 'cut us to bits' early.\" Following the Test The Independent quoted former Ireland fly-half Tony Ward saying of Campese that, \"He is the Maradona, the Pel\u00e9 of international Rugby all rolled into one. You cannot put a value on his importance to our game. He is a breath of fresh air and I think perhaps the greatest player of all time. Without being too soppy, it was an honour to be at Lansdowne Road just to see him perform.\" Clem Thomas of The Observer wrote following the Test that, \"it will always be remembered as Campese's match...\" In 2013 former New Zealand rugby player Sean Fitzpatrick wrote that, \"One man can never win a match on his own but he came as close to that as is possible with his display in the 1991 World Cup semi-final. We were beaten by half-time.\" British rugby writer Stephen Jones added, \"If I had to put together the greatest rugby match I've ever seen I'd have the first half of Australia versus New Zealand in '91 in Dublin\u2026\" 1991 World Cup Final \u2013 Australia 12 \u2013 6 England Following England's 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final victory over Scotland in a tryless Test, Campese led a media campaign designating England as a boring rugby team. Campese said that if he played for England, he would insist on playing the flyhalf position because it would be the only way he could touch the ball. Campese is quoted as saying, 'I wouldn't play for England even if you paid me' and 'Playing that sort of boring stuff is a good way to destroy the image of the game. They're all so scared of losing over here they won't try anything.' He further added that 'England would never beat us in the World Cup because they are a bunch of Toffs, and we are convicts.' Australia won the 1991 World Cup Final by beating England 12\u20136. Campese did not have much \"ball possession\" in the final, as evidenced by the fact that Wallabies flyhalf Michael Lynagh touched the ball 17 times in the Test, compared to England flyhalf Rob Andrew, who touched the ball 41 times. However, four moments involving David Campese are often recorded in reports of the final. Campese came close to scoring a try in the early stages of the first half of the final. Australia scored their only try of the 1991 Rugby World Cup Final in the 26th minute. Campese's \"chasing\" played an indirect part in the lead-up to the Wallabies' first try. Australia scored moments later off a rolling maul. Campese was involved in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage \"may have had an overlap,\" when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty.\" The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. In the final stages of the final, Campese was involved in a backline movement that nearly led to an English try."

Campese left the field due to injury, to be replaced by Peter Jorgensen. Australia 26 \u2013 South Africa 3 On 15 August 1992 South Africa played a rugby Test against New Zealand , which was their first Test at international level since the International Rugby Board banned South Africa from playing international Test-level rugby due to apartheid boycotts. One week later on 22 August 1992 South Africa played the World Champion Wallabies. In the Test against South Africa, Campese became the first Australian to play 70 Test matches and he became the first rugby player to score 50 tries. Campese's sudden appearance from no where to take the try-scoring pass from Tim Horan, and the cleanliness of his jersey in the muddy conditions, have been the subject of various portrayals in rugby literature. Michael Blucher in Perfect Union: The parallel lives of Wallaby centres Tim Horan and Jason Little described Campese as 'standing out like a beacon in the only remaining unmuddied gold jersey.' Peter FitzSimons in Nick Farr-Jones: The Authorised Biography depicted Campese as 'the man with the cleanest jersey on the field, shining out there like a flashing orange beacon, David Campese on the burst, who crossed for the try.' Blucher further recorded that: \"A magical moment shared by the same two who had created similar havoc for the All Blacks in Dublin. 'You still owe me a few,' Campese said, after Horan had picked himself up and rushed over to offer congratulations.\""

        "content": "In October/November 1992, Campese travelled with the 10th Wallabies for the 1992 Australia rugby union tour of Europe. He was frequently rested due to ongoing injury concerns and missed most of Australia's provincial games. However, he played in both Tests on tour, against Ireland and Wales, and the traditional tour-closing game against the Barbarians. He was also the Wallabies' top try-scorer on tour with four . Australia endured an injury-plagued tour. Wallaby captain Michael Lynagh suffered a badly dislocated shoulder in Australia's victory over Ireland, loosehead props Tony Daly and Cameron Lillicrap and centre Anthony Herbert were required to fly back to Australia due to injuries, and Australian second-rower John Eales suffered a shoulder injury that sidelined him for a year in the game against Llanelli. In addition, Australia's two wingers David Campese and Paul Carozza were both forced to sit out of training sessions \"nursing niggling injury concerns.\" Australia came under scrutiny following losses in provincial games to Munster, Swansea, and Llanelli - matches in which Campese did not play. Australian team management selected a full-strength side, including Campese, for Australia's first touring match against Leinster . Leinster scored the first try in the early stages of the match, after Campese failed to properly tackle his opposite winger Niall Woods, allowing Woods to score a try. However, after the Wallabies trailed 6\u20138 at half-time, Campese scored two tries in the second half - one off a Tim Horan scissors' pass and the second off a Michael Lynagh inside-pass from a set-play. Campese did not play in Australia's second match on tour, a famous 19\u201322 loss to Munster. Campese returned to the Test side for their third match on tour against Ulster . In the Wallaby's final match prior to their first Test on tour against Wales, Campese came off the bench in the second half of Australia's 14\u20136 victory over Connacht. Following Australia's Test victory over Ireland, Campese was rested and not named in Australia's next five provincial matches prior to the following Test against Wales - against Swansea , Wales B , Neath , Llanelli , and Monmouthshire . Following Australia's victory over Wales in their second and final Test of the tour, Campese did not play in the Wallabies' only provincial game before their final match on tour against the Barbarians, against Welsh Students . Australia 23- Wales 6 Campese played in his final Test of 1992 in a 23\u20136 victory over Wales. Campese scored a try after gathering a kick-through by Australian outside-centre Jason Little and sprinting down the sideline for a try."

        "content": "Australia 12 - South Africa 19 Early in the first Test against South Africa, Campese was involved in a scuffle with Springboks Pieter Muller and James Small. Australia led South Africa 9-0 after 16 minutes following three penalty goals kicked by Marty Roebuck. However, in the final 10 minutes of the first half, Springbok inside centre Heinrich F\u00fcls executed a kick, forcing Campese to run back and field it, while he and Springbok outside centre Pieter Muller gave chase. Campese was unable to field the ball, and instead slipped over the ball about a metre from the Australian try-line, allowing Muller to gather the ball and score the try. In the documentary of Campese's career, Campese: Rugby's My Life, Campese confessed that he perhaps \"tried too hard\" in this Test, trying to compensate for his early mistake. Following Campese's first Test performance, Alec Evans, the assistant coach of Australia's 1984 Grand Slam side, went public suggesting that Campese should be dropped from the Australian side. Australia 28 - South Africa 20 Campese recovered from his first Test performance to help Tim Horan score a try in the second Test. Australia had a scrum in their own territory and Campese was in position for a clearing kick. Campese instead opted to run and dummied past South African openside flanker Francois Pienaar. Campese's run brought play into South African territory. Campese then flicked a pass along the ground, described by Australian rugby commentator David Fordham as an 'ill-discipled pass', that Australian eightman Tim Gavin recovered. Two phases later Campese took a pass from Nick Farr-Jones in the first-receiver position, launched a high kick that his opposite winger Jacques Olivier wasn't able to field. The ball took a fortuitous bounce, and Australian inside centre Tim Horan was able to chase the ball down and fall upon it to score a try. Australia 19 - South Africa 12 In My Game Your Game David Campese is reported calling the third Test against South Africa from 1993 one of the greatest performances of his rugby career. \"When I think back over my Test career, it seems most of my best performances have been outside Australia, such as the World Cup of 1991 in Britain, the Wallaby Tour of the UK in 1988, and the Grand Slam trip of 1984,\" he said. \"There have been some good moments at home, such as the third Test against South Africa at the Sydney Football Stadium in 1993\". Following the first two Tests of the series, Campese noticed that following short kick-offs, when mauls would be formed, his opposite South African winger would stand further than 20 metres behind the contest for the ball. Prior to the Test, Campese arranged with Wallaby halfback Nick Farr-Jones that if he saw his opposite winger standing far in the backfield, he would call \"Leaguey\" to signal to Farr-Jones to attempt a blindside move with him. During the 19th minute of the second half of the third Test Australia formed a rolling maul in their own half. Nick Farr-Jones linked with Campese for the last time in their representative careers. He went down the blind-side and passed the ball to Campese, who ran past Springbok scrumhalf Robert du Preez. Campese ran along the sideline and brought play into South African territory. He then gave an inside pass to Farr-Jones in support, who in turn passed the ball inside to Tim Gavin in support. Gavin ran the ball into contact. The ball came back to Farr-Jones from the ruck, he handed it on to Phil Kearns, who gained metres for Australia with a strong run. As the next stage of play developed, Campese had re-positioned himself in the centres where he took a pass, made a tiny break, and lofted a pass over several South African players to Tim Horan in support, who went on to score a try in the 59th minute of the Test. Campese received the man of the match award for his performance. Following this game, Spiro Zavos in The Sydney Morning Herald called Campese \"the Mozart of Rugby.\""

Kafer then suffered a broken leg during a training session.

        "content": "Campese was a member of the 11th Wallabies to tour the United Kingdom. The 1996 Australia rugby union tour in Europe was Campese's final rugby tour before his retirement from international Test rugby. While the tour contained Tests against Italy, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, Campese only played against Italy and Wales. The Australian team was heavily criticised for its performances. However, the tour remains the only time Australia had won every match on a tour to Europe that included provincial matches. Australia 40 \u2013 Italy 18 Australia's first Test of the 1996 Tour to Europe against Italy marked David Campese's 100th international Test. He became the second person, after French centre Philippe Sella, to achieve the milestone. The Test took place two days after Campese's 34th birthday in Padova, where Campese had played rugby in Italy for three years from 1984 to 1986. The Test took place close to his father's birthplace, Vicenza. In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese recalls that, \"Unfortunately, they were not treated to vintage performances, by myself or the rest of the Wallabies. The Italians got stuck into us and, in some respects, we were lucky to get away with a 40-18 scoreline.\" Australia's Tim Horan was moved to the wing for the Test against Italy and scored a try. Campese then missed national selection for the next Test against Scotland, with coach Greg Smith opting to continue to play Tim Horan on the wing and play Joe Roff in Campese's place. This marked only the third time in Campese's 101-Test career that he was dropped from the Australian rugby team. Campese also did not achieve national selection for the Test against Ireland. Australian coach Greg Smith opted to return Tim Horan to the inside centre position and play Jason Little on the wing in Campese's place. In a midweek match against Munster, Campese played what he later described as \"one of my better performances for quite some time, scoring two tries, setting up another and perhaps defending like I'd never defended before.\" Following this performance, Campese was selected for Australia's final Test of the 1996 Australia rugby union tour. Australia 28 \u2013 Wales 19 Campese was recalled to the Australian side for their final Test of the 1996 European tour, his 101st Test and his final Test appearance playing for the Wallabies. Australian coach Greg Smith returned Jason Little to the outside centre position and situated Campese on the right wing while Joe Roff occupied the left wing. Australia led Wales 18\u20136 at halftime. In the second half Welsh outside centre Gareth Thomas scored a try after intercepting a pass from George Gregan. Following this Welsh flyhalf Jonathan Davies kicked two penalties to give Wales a 19\u201318 lead. Australia's Matt Burke landed a penalty to give Australia a 21\u201319 lead, before Australia scored a penalty try in the final moments of the Test to win 28\u201319. Australia 39 \u2013 Barbarians 12 Campese played his last match for Australia against the Barbarians at Twickenham. Prior to the match Campese was offered the special privilege of playing for the Barbarians in his final match. However, Australian team management rejected the idea. Campese scored a try in his last game after taking a pass from Australian hooker Michael Foley and slipping under an attempted tackle from South African flyhalf Joel Stransky. Following the game, Campese completed a lap of honour and was afforded a standing ovation from crowd, to bring an end to his international career."

Former Australian rugby player and sevens coach Michael O'Connor offered Campese the following praise after placing him in his 'Best Ever Aussie Sevens team': \"Campo in his prime \u2013 there wasn't a better finishing winger that I've seen. He just knew how to get over that try line. But also his support lines were a class above. The lines he ran, he put himself in such good support positions. That and his reading of the game was very rare. He also played a lot of sevens for Australia and for Randwick at the Melrose Sevens, so he had that in depth level of understanding of the game.\""

        "content": "Throughout his rugby sevens career, Campese made 12 appearances at the Hong Kong Sevens , during which he played in three victorious Australian campaigns , and won the Leslie Williams Award for Player of the Tournament in 1988. On 16 March 2015, the Hong Kong Rugby Football Union announced Australia's David Campese as the fifth member of 'The Hong Kong Magnificent Seven', the HKRFU's commemorative campaign to recognise the seven most formative players to have played in the past 40 Years of Sevens in Hong Kong in 2015. Campese was honoured alongside of Jonah Lomu, Waisale Serevi, Eric Rush, Christian Cullen, Ben Gollings and Zhang Zhiqiang. In 1983 Campese debuted for the Australian Sevens team at the Hong Kong Sevens, in a team containing Peter Faulk , John Maxwell , Mark Ella, Glen Ella, Brendan Moon, Peter Lucas, Gary Pearce, Chris Roche and Qele Ratu. The tournament took place in what has been described as \"some of the wettest conditions ever recorded in Hong Kong in March.\" Australia began by defeating Malaysia , Japan and the Solomon Island . Australia then defeated Tonga 12\u20136 in the quarter-final, Western Samoa 16\u20130 in the semi-finals, and Fiji 14\u20134 in the final. Australia scored 192 points and conceded only 18 in its seven matches at the 1983 Hong Kong Sevens. In 1984, Campese returned to his second Hong Kong Sevens tournament with the Australian Sevens team, in a team containing captain-coach John Maxwell, Mark Ella, Glen Ella, Brendan Moon, Chris Roche and Michael Lynagh. Australia won their first match of the tournament against Kwang-Hwa, and faced Canada in the second game. Australia were eliminated by Canada from the Hong Kong Sevens in controversial circumstances. Both sides had scored the same number of tries and goals and Australia was eliminated on the toss of a coin. Since then the rules have been changed to allow for extra time when teams finish level, and the first team to score eliminates the other side. In 1985 Campese won his second Hong Kong Sevens tournament \u2013 Australia's third tournament victory overall \u2013 in a 24\u201310 victory over Public School Wanderers. The Australia rugby sevens team contained: Roger Gould , David Campese , Phillip Cox , Glen Ella , Bruce Frame , Peter Lucas , Michael Lynagh , Simon Poidevin , Steve Tuynman . Alan Jones . Australia defeated Sri Lanka, Tonga and Ireland Wolfhounds on day one, before beating Western Samoa in the semi-final. The starting Australia national rugby sevens team for the final against Public School Wanderers consisted of: 1. Roger Gould; 2. Simon Poidevin; 3. Peter Lucas; 5. Michael Lynagh; 6. Bruce Frame; 7. David Campese; 9. Glen Ella. The Public School Wanderers from Scotland included: 1. Eric Paxton; 2. Gary Callander; 4. Bob Hogarth; 5. John Rutherford; 6. Peter Steven; 7. John Jeffery; 7. Roger Baird. Public School Wanderers opened the scoring in the final, when Callendar took an inside pass from Hogarth for a try that was converted. However, Australia responded when Glen Ella doubled-around Simon Poidevin and ran through a gap. Ella then flicked a scissors pass to Peter Lucas who out-sprinted Roger Baird to Public School Wanderers' try-line. In the final play before half-time, Michael Lynagh took a \"tap-kick\" near Australia's try-line. He passed to Glen Ella who in turn moved the ball back to Lynagh. Lynagh threw the ball to Simon Poidevin who ran down the sideline. Campese supported Poidevin on the outside, took a pass from him, and ran more than half the length of the field to score his seventh try of the tournament, to equal Peter Steven as the tournament's leading try-scorer. Lynagh converted Campese's try to give Australia a 12-6 half-time lead. In the second half, Public School Wanderers' Peter Steven made a line-break but threw the ball backwards to Glen Ella who intercepted the ball for Australia. Ella handed the ball to Campese, running at pace, who ran around John Jeffery to score a try behind the posts - his eighth try of the tournament, making him the leading try-scorer at the 1985 Hong Kong Sevens. Michael Lynagh converted the try to give Australia a 18\u20136 lead. Lynagh scored Australia's final try, which started with Glen Ella hurling a pass in-field to Simon Poidevin who caught a low-landing ball. Poidevin likewise threw a low pass to Roger Gould. Poidevin doubled-around Gould, who feigned a pass-attempt before moving the ball inside to Bruce Frame. Frame kicked the ball forward and Michael Lynagh caught it on the full before running more than half the length of the field to score a try under the posts, which he converted to give Australia a 24\u20136 lead. John Jeffery scored the last try of the final in the concluding play of the game, picking up the ball and placing it over the Australian try-line after Peter Steven was tackled less than a metre from it. The try was unconverted and Australia won the final 24\u201310. In late 1985, Campese was embroiled in controversy when he, Glen Ella and Roger Gould decided to participate in a sevens tournament in South Africa. At the time, international sports people were asked to support opposition to South Africa's apartheid regime by boycotting tour there. Campese's move drew criticism from Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke. In 1986, Australia made it to the semi-finals of the Hong Kong Sevens, but were defeated by the French Barbarians 20\u201314, who went on to lose the final to New Zealand 32\u201312. In May 1986, Campese played for the Australian sevens team at the Sport Aid Sevens tournament at Cardiff. Australia easily defeated Ireland before going on to lose to England after Glen Ella threw a pass that went over Campese's head and was intercepted by England for a try. In 1987, Campese captained the Australian side for the first time at the Hong Kong Sevens with Alan Jones as coach. Australia faced Fiji in the semi-final, in which they fell behind 0-14 after five minutes, before going on to lose the game 8-14. Following the Hong Kong Sevens, Campese participated in the NSW Sevens at Concord Oval. Australia defeated Western Samoa, Korea and the Netherlands on the first day, before beating Tonga in the quarter-final and Korea in the semi-final. Australia then defeated New Zealand in the final 22\u201312, in what Simon Poidevin later described as \"one of the most satisfying and gutsy [victories] that I\u2019ve been associated with in an Australian team.\" In 1988, Campese embarked on perhaps his most successful campaign at the Hong Kong Sevens, winning his third and final Hong Kong Sevens tournament with the Australian side, and being awarded the Leslie Williams Award for Player of the Tournament. The victorious Australian squad contained: Michael Lynagh , Brad Burke , David Campese , Julian Gardner , Tim Gavin , Jeff Miller , Acura Niuqila , Brian Smith , Steve Tuynman . Bob Dwyer . In 1989 Australia made it to the final of the Hong Kong Sevens, but were defeated in the final by New Zealand, 10\u201322. Campese made his ninth appearance at the Hong Kong Sevens in 1993 with the Australian team. Australia were defeated by Fiji in the semi-final 14\u201317. Tim Horan scored a try in the first minute of the game, but Campese was forced to leave the match shortly after this due to injury. Waisale Serevi scored three tries for Fiji and they emerged victorious. In 1994, Campese captained Australia for the Hong Kong Sevens, with Glen Ella acting as Australian coach. The team contained Tim Horan, Jason Little, David Wilson, Ilie Tabua, George Gregan and Ryan Constable. Australia easily won their round-robin stages on the first day, narrowly defeated Samoa in the quarter final, comprehensively defeated Fiji in the semi-final, before losing the final to New Zealand 32\u201320. Campese returned to Hong Kong three years later for the 1997 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Australia were one of three teams, along with England and tournament hosts Hong Kong to automatically qualify for the event. Australia were defeated by New Zealand in the quarter-final 12\u201340."

        "content": "During 1990 Campese participated in the Melrose Sevens in Scotland playing for Randwick, after the Melrose Rugby Club accorded Campese's Randwick Rugby Club the singular honour of an invitation to its one hundredth Melrose Sevens. Twenty clubs took part, and Randwick were one of four guest teams including Racing Club of Paris, Harlequins and London Scottish from outside of Scotland. Randwick's squad of ten players were: Gavin Boneham, David Campese, Michael Cheika, Anthony Dwyer, Mark Ella, John Flett, John Maxwell , Acura Niuqila, Darren Phillips and Lloyd Walker. John Howard was the manager and Stuart Wheeler, the assistant manager. Campese was Randwick's top points scorer with 44 of its 92 points. The Herald of Scotland reported that Campese scored seven tries and nine conversions, which included scoring all of Randwick's points against Melrose. He was later praised for giving \"one of the most dominant performances in tournament history.\" Randwick won their first match against Glasgow High Kelvinside 30\u20130, before defeating Edinburgh Academical Football Club 20\u20136 in their second match. Randwick then defeated Melrose in the semi-final 16\u201315. Campese opened the scoring of the semi-final with a try that he converted to give Randwick a 6\u20130 lead. The scores were level at halftime 6-6. Campese scored first for Randwick in the second half with a try that he again converted to make the score 12\u20136. However, Melrose leveled the scores again, and with two minutes remaining Melrose captain Craig Chalmers kicked a penalty goal for a 15\u201312 lead. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that, \"Randwick looked briefly flustered but Campese, skipping through on a 30m run, rescued the game with 60 seconds remaining, to send the Australians through 16-15.\" Graham Law in The Scotsman reported on the final moments of the semi-final and wrote that, \"Randwick secured ball from the kick-off and when Melrose infringed at a ruck full-time had been reached but, correctly, referee Jim Fleming allowed play to continue and Walker released Campese from nearly halfway. Chalmers, with the first engagement, and Purves both made tackles but Campese, now domiciled in Italy, seemed to expand and aquaplaned to the goal-line. It was no-side and Keith Robertson's men were out. The Sunday Herald of Scotland wrote that, \"No-one else in the tournament would have had the pace and verve to squeeze in at the right corner to deny the hosts...\" Following the tournament Campese admitted that, \"\"If it had not been wet, I would not have made that try against Melrose.\" Campese's Randwick side defeated Kelso in the final 28\u20136 in front of 20,000 spectators. Campese scored a try and converted two John Flett tries in the final. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that, \"Campese, throughout the day benefiting from his telepathic understanding with Mark Ella, scored an outstanding, individual try from his own 22, Ella converting for a 12-4 lead.\" The Sunday Herald of Scotland wrote that, \"Most of all, however, the Australians had the threatening presence of David Campese. Whether lying wide or rallying in retreat, Campese was the spearhead. An inch of space to run was gleefully accepted, and over the tournament, he scored 46 points, with seven tries and nine conversions, including all of Randwick's points against Melrose.\""

Matthew Burke ; 3. Willie Ofahengaue ; 4. Semi Taupeaafe; 5. Jim Fenwicke; 6. Grant Lodge ; 7. John Flett; 8. Ryan Constable ; 9. David Campese ; 10. Michael Lynagh . Australia was placed in Pool C. They defeated Taiwan in their opening match 28\u20138, before losing to Tonga 7\u201310 in their second game, in a surprise upset. Isi Tu'ivai opened the scoring for Tonga when he took a quick tap-kick, booted the ball in-goal, and ran around Campese for the touchdown. Australian Semi Taupeaafe scored a try in the second half to level the scores 7-7. However, Tonga's Tu'ivai kicked the match-winning drop goal in the final play of the game to give his side a 10\u20137 victory over the Australians. Australia responded to their second game loss with a 40\u20130 victory over Italy in their third game. Australia defeated Argentina 42\u20135 in their fourth group stage game, and concluded their first day matches with a 26\u201314 victory over Scotland. Australia finished second in Group C behind Tonga on the same number of points. Tonga lost their first group game to Scotland 7-15. However, because they defeated Australia in their game against one another, they finished top of their group. The quarter-finals of the inaugural 1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens took the form of a round-robin tournament with the teams split into two groups. Campese's Australia qualified for Group F which also consisted of South Africa, New Zealand and England. Australia defeated South Africa 7\u20135 in their opening match of the group. Campese was instrumental in Australia's only try of the game. Australian player Jim Fenwicke was driven back in a tackle and he lofted the ball to Campese in support. South African fullback Andr\u00e9 Joubert rushed up and attempted to intercept the floating ball which opened a gap for Campese, who ran from his own quarter and into the South African half. Chester Williams attempted to ankle-tap Campese but missed. Campese attempted to run around Joost van der Westhuizen and occupied him with a goose-step before he passed in-field to John Flett. Flett made a diagonal run toward the posts, but was tackled just before he could score, before he found Matt Burke in support who scored next to the posts. Michael Lynagh converted the try to give Australia a 7\u20130 lead. However, South Africa responded when Andr\u00e9 Joubert scored an unconverted try. The score remained 7-5 and Australia emerged victorious. The Australians then lost their next group game against New Zealand 42\u20130. Australia needed to defeat England in their final group stage to progress to the semi-finals of the tournament. Campese scored in the first minute of the game when he fielded a kick from Nick Beal. Campese beat Beal on the inside and then made a run along the side-line where he avoided an attempted ankle-tap from Matt Dawson, outflanked Tim Rodber and scored the try untouched. Ryan Constable added another try to give Australia a 14\u20130 lead. In the final play before halftime, England's Justyn Cassell scored a try from some loose line-out ball, which Nick Beal failed to convert, giving Australia a 14-5 halftime lead. Dave Scully scored a try for England after picking up a loose ball from \"broken-play\" to reduce Australia's lead to 14\u201312. However, Campese responded by occupying the England number 7 with a goose-step, which created an overlap for Semi Taupeaafe who scored the final try of the game untouched. Australia won the last quarter-final pool game against England 21\u201312. Australia topped its group with seven points, the same number as England . Controversy arose following the quarter-final round robin stage. England finished with the same number of table points as Australia, scored more tries than them in the group stage , and believed they had done enough to avoid Fiji in the semi-finals. However, tournament organisers informed England that because they finished with the same number of points as Australia, the team that won the individual game between the two sides would top Group F. This meant that Australia faced Ireland in one semi-final and England met Fiji in the other. Australia defeated Ireland in the semi-final 21-19 after Willie Ofahengaue scored the game-winning try in the last play of the game. Australia narrowly lost the first Rugby Sevens World Cup to England in the final 17\u201321. England player Andy Harriman scored in the first minute of the game when he received the ball in open space and ran around Campese to score under the posts. England raced to a 21\u20130 lead after tries from Lawrence Dallaglio and Tim Rodber. Australia responded with tries scored by Michael Lynagh and David Campese. Campese scored his try by goose-stepping past Tim Rodber and chipping the ball over Dave Scully into the in-goal area and falling onto the ball. Semi Taupeaafe scored the final try for Australia, but they went on to lose the final 17\u201321. In 1997, Campese's rugby season involved Sevens representation and a trip to the World Cup in Hong Kong."

        "content": "In 1998 Mark Ella replaced Jeff Miller as coach of the Australian Sevens Team. After New South Wales Waratahs coach Matt Williams explained to Campese that he wanted to use him as an 'impact' player coming off the bench more often during the 1998 Super 12 season, the ARU approached Campese about acting as an ambassador for the rugby union code trying to raise to game's profile throughout Australia. The ARU also wanted Campese to take a more active role in Rugby Sevens, participating in the IRB World Series Sevens circuit leading up to the 1998 Commonwealth Games to be held in Malaysia. Campese played in Australia's Sevens team alongside players Brendan Williams, Ricky Nalatu, Matt Dowling, Tyron Mandrusiak, Richard Graham, and Cameron Pither. In Ella: The Definitive Biography Mark Ella recalled that, 'Campo was past his best, but in terms of rugby sense and experience he was still miles ahead of the young players.' The Australian team toured Uruguay, Argentina, France, Hong Kong, Fiji and Jerusalem. In Fiji in the Australian Sevens team were easily defeated in the quarter-finals by Fiji. In Tokyo Australia lost to New Zealand in the semi-finals. The Australian Sevens team then toured Paris and won their first Sevens tournament in 10 years by defeating New Zealand in the final. Prior to the 1998 Commonwealth Games the Australian Sevens team visited Israel for the \"Holy Sevens\", dubbed \"The Holiest Sevens Tournament in the World\". Mark Ella later recalled that the Australian team visited Bethlehem \"to see where Campo was born.\" At the 1998 Commonwealth Games Australia finished on top of their pool, defeated England in the quarter-finals, but were defeated by Fiji in the semi-finals. New Zealand defeated Fiji in the final to win gold, Fiji received silver, and Australia defeated Samoa in the third-place match to win a bronze medal. Prior to Australia's third-place play-off, Campese asked Australian coach Mark Ella to select the younger players ahead of him. Campese ran onto the field in the final minutes to convert a Brendan Williams try, thus completing his last game of rugby sevens for Australia."

        "content": "\u2013\tBob Dwyer, 'Campese', The Winning Way , 71. Shortly following Campese's international rugby debut on the 1982 Australian tour to New Zealand, several rugby league clubs made offers to him to switch rugby codes. The Canberra Raiders, Manly-Warringah, Canterbury Bulldogs, and the Gold Coast , are all reputed to have made offers to Campese to join their club. In 1983 the Parramatta Eels contacted Campese about playing rugby league for their club. Parramatta won the premiership the last two consecutive years, and won it again in 1983. The side contained players such as Peter Sterling, Brett Kenny, Mick Cronin, Eric Grothe and Steve Ella. The club's chief executive Denis Fitzgerald contacted Campese and made him an offer, however he rejected the team's proposal. In The Winning Way, former Australian coach Bob Dwyer documented that retired Parramatta Eels coach Jack Gibson once expressed a desire to have Campese in his team: \"Jack Gibson, the celebrated League coach in Sydney, said to me one day that he would love to have Campese in his team for three reasons. One, he was a brilliant attacker. Two, he was a good chaser of the ball. Three, he has a high work rate. The last of these is quite true, incidentally, although Campese rarely receives acknowledgement for it.\" During the Wallabies' 1988 Australia rugby union tour of England, Scotland and Italy, Campese was contacted by St Helens prior to Australia's 12th match on tour against Combined Services about playing for their club. St Helens reportedly asked Michael O'Connor to recommend a player to join the club, and he nominated Campese. St Helens are reported to have offered Campese a deal between \u00a3300,000 and \u00a3350,000 over a three-year period, dependent upon a few variables such as number of appearances. Campese rejected the deal within a few minutes. Following the Wallabies' final match of the U.K. leg of their tour, Campese travelled to Italy where St Helens made more overtures towards him, which were declined. St Helens continued to contact Campese about playing rugby league when he returned to Australia, however he continued to reject their offers.  On 15 July 1989, the night of the third Test between the Wallabies and the British Lions, St Helens made another offer to Campese.  When he declined their proposal, St Helens offered him another \u00a310,000 , but for the last time he rejected their request to play of their club. \"I suppose I was shocked that the interest from St Helens was still there after my performance that day,\" Campese wrote in On a Wing and a Prayer. \"But perhaps they figured I would be an easy target after a game like that!\" In Campo: Still Entertaining, Campese wrote that, \"Looking back now, as a long retired Wallaby, it does not bother me in the slightest that I didn't accept an offer to play rugby league.\""

In 2010 its capacity was reduced to 55,000 people due to renovations. Deportivo Cali's old home stadium was Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Pascual Guerrero, with a capacity of 43,130. Deportivo Cali is the only Colombian football club that owns its own stadium. It was also the first Colombian team to reach the final of Copa Libertadores in 1978. In 2016, Forbes listed Deportivo Cali as the 36th most valuable football team of the Americas. Deportivo Cali is the only club in Colombia to be owned by its fans."

        "content": "Cali Football Club was formed in 1908 by students under the leadership of Nazario Lalinde, Juan Pablo Lalinde and Fidel Lalinde, who came back from Europe bringing football to the city of Cali, but in 1912 the students under the leadership of the three Lalinde brothers organized the team and renamed it as Deportivo Cali beginning practice under their first coach, Catalan born Francisco Villa Bisa. Their first match was between CFC \"A\" and CFC \"B\" in the Versailles pitch, with 300 spectators in attendance. By 1928 the name was changed to \"Deportivo Cali A\" and the club represented the Valle del Cauca Department in the National Games, earning the titles between 1928 and 1930. In 1945 several clubs decided to become part of the club adding new sports to the institution such as athletics, basketball, and swimming. During the next several years the club played against teams from the country and by 1948 the team was ready to play its first professional season in the newly created national league. Their first game was a defeat against Junior in Barranquilla by a 2\u20130 score, and their first match at home was a 2\u20132 draw against Deportes Caldas. The first victory came in the fourth match against Atl\u00e9tico Nacional by a 4\u20131 score. They would end the season in eighth place with a record of 6 victories, 4 draws and 8 defeats."

        "content": "Between 1965 and 1974 Deportivo Cali saw its golden era. During this period, Deportivo Cali reached 11 finals, from which they won five of their nine Colombian championship titles in 1965, 1967, 1969, 1970, and 1974. It was then that Deportivo Cali was one of the top teams from the Colombian national league, along with Bogot\u00e1 sides Millonarios and Santa Fe. It was also during this time period that Deportivo Cali had many of the best players to come across the Colombian football league. This team included: Jos\u00e9 Rosendo Toledo, \"El Mo\u00f1o\" Mu\u00f1oz, Miguel Escobar, \u00d3scar L\u00f3pez, Mario Sanclemente, German \"El Burrito\" Gonz\u00e1lez, Jose Yudica, Miguel \u00c1ngel \"El Mago\" Loayza, Jairo \"El Maestrico\" Arboleda, Oscar Mario \"Tranvia\" Desiderio, Diego Edison Uma\u00f1a, Henry \"La Mosca\" Caicedo, Iroldo Rodriguez de Oliveira, Jorge Ram\u00edrez Gallego, Roberto \u00c1lvarez, Quarentinha, Bernardo \"El Cunda\" Valencia, and Ricardo Pegnoty. Unfortunately, most of these players did not receive international fame, yet Jairo Arboleda could have been one of the best players Colombia has had in midfield along with Carlos \"El Pibe\" Valderrama. Similar to Valderrama, Arboleda used a variety of skill and \"magic\" that left opponents lost and beaten, which gave rise to his nickname \"El Maestrico\". He is mostly recognized in Cali as one of Colombia's best players ever. Arboleda was unfortunate to be called to the Colombian national football team at a time when the team was not fully developed and organized, largely preventing him from showing away his skill at an international level. In 1978 Deportivo Cali became the first Colombian club to reach the Copa Libertadores final, losing against Boca Juniors. During the 1980s, whilst Am\u00e9rica de Cali and Atl\u00e9tico Nacional started their emergence and consolidation as Colombian football powers, Deportivo Cali began to fall behind in championship titles and ended up as league runners-up behind its crosstown rival twice in a row, in 1985 and 1986. The key players for Deportivo Cali at the time were \"El Pibe\" Valderrama and Bernardo Red\u00edn, none of whom was able to win a title with the club. In 1996, the club broke a 22-year domestic title drought under the guidance of coach Fernando \"El Pecoso\" Castro, and famous goalkeeper Miguel \"El Show\" Calero. The title was sealed after a scoreless draw with crosstown rivals Am\u00e9rica on the last matchday of the championship round, which ensured the team would end ahead of Millonarios on bonus points. Two years later and with Jos\u00e9 Eugenio \"Chech\u00e9\" Hern\u00e1ndez as manager, Deportivo Cali won its seventh title after finishing in the top eight of the Finalizaci\u00f3n tournament, and topping a semifinal group including Atl\u00e9tico Nacional, Millonarios, and Am\u00e9rica de Cali. This qualified the team for the finals against Once Caldas, whom they defeated 4\u20130 in the first leg in Cali and tied 0\u20130 in Manizales in the second leg in order to claim the title. Deportivo Cali qualified for the 1999 Copa Libertadores as Colombian champions, and qualified out of a group which also included Once Caldas, and Argentine sides River Plate and V\u00e9lez Sarsfield. After eliminating Colo-Colo in the round of 16, Uruguayan side Bella Vista in the quarterfinals and Cerro Porte\u00f1o in the semifinals, they managed to reach the final of the competition for the second time in its history. Unfortunately, luck was not on their side and they lost to Palmeiras of Brazil on penalties after winning the first leg in Cali 1\u20130 and losing 2\u20131 in the return leg in S\u00e3o Paulo. Venezuelan goalkeeper Rafael Dudamel, defenders Hern\u00e1n Gaviria, Mario Yepes, and Gerardo Bedoya, and midfielders Arley Betancourt, Mayer Candelo, and Mart\u00edn Zapata were some of the most important players of the club in both the 1998 national championship and the Copa Libertadores run the following year."

        "content": "In the start of the 21st century, the club has seen a major downfall in quality of players, quality of team and general managers, and overall results in both the domestic league and international competition. On 24 October 2002, players Herman Gaviria and Giovanni C\u00f3rdoba were hit by lightning during a training session with the team. Gaviria was killed instantly, though he was not pronounced dead until arriving at Valle del Lil\u00ed Hospital, while C\u00f3rdoba died three days later. At the time, the team was leading the 2002 Finalizaci\u00f3n and was heavily favored to win the title but was unable to recover from this event and ended in second place of its semifinal group, behind eventual champions Independiente Medell\u00edn. During this timeframe, Cali won its eighth domestic championship , but lost finals to underdog teams such as Deportes Tolima and Deportivo Pasto in the 2003 Finalizaci\u00f3n and 2006 Apertura tournaments, respectively. The championship in the second tournament of the 2005 season allowed Deportivo Cali to take part in the 2006 Copa Libertadores, in which the team failed to make it out of the group stage after only being able to collect one point out of 18. A poor campaign during the 2007 Finalizaci\u00f3n caused Deportivo Cali to fail to qualify for the semifinal stage of the domestic league for the first time since short tournaments began being played in Colombian football. Spectators say that the downfall of the 2007 season was a result of the major injury of Sergio Herrera and the departure of Martin Cardetti. Between 2006 and 2007, the club saw over three coaches, and two of them in the 2007 Finalizaci\u00f3n season alone. The coaches who served Deportivo Cali during this time were Pedro Sarmiento, who won the league with the team as coach in 2005 and was dismissed after losing the 2006 Apertura finals to Deportivo Pasto, Omar Labruna and N\u00e9stor Otero. Uruguayan Jos\u00e9 Daniel Carre\u00f1o took the reins ahead of the 2008 season, replacing N\u00e9stor Otero. Deportivo Cali, during his management, had an above average Apertura, coming in sixth place which qualified them for the semifinals of the tournament. In the Copa Colombia, the club ended in third place of its group and failed to qualify for further play, which was considered as an embarrassment as Deportivo Cali was the favorite to win the group. During the semifinals of the Apertura, Cali failed to win the first four matches, losing two and tying the remaining two. After failing to win the fourth game , Carre\u00f1o was sacked and replaced by caretaker manager Ricardo Mart\u00ednez, who managed the team until the end of the 2008 season and qualified it for the 2009 Copa Sudamericana, in which they were knocked out in the first stage by Universidad de Chile. The 2009 season saw Deportivo Cali qualifying for the semifinals of the Apertura tournament but missing out on the finals on goal difference, while in the Finalizaci\u00f3n tournament they failed to qualify for the semifinals. In 2010, Deportivo Cali failed to qualify for the final rounds of both the Apertura and the Finalizaci\u00f3n, but was able to win the Copa Colombia for the first time in history under the management of Jaime de la Pava. Los Azucareros managed to win their regional group and then defeated Junior, Santa Fe, and La Equidad in their run to the final, where they faced surprise package Itag\u00fc\u00ed Ditaires. Deportivo Cali won both legs of the final, 1\u20130 in Itag\u00fc\u00ed and 2\u20130 at the Estadio Deportivo Cali, which also hosted its first official match that year with a 2\u20130 victory over Deportes Quind\u00edo on 21 February. In the 2011 Apertura, and despite having one of their worst starts in history by losing the first four games of the season, Deportivo Cali managed to make it to the quarterfinals, where they were eliminated in a penalty shoot-out by eventual champions Atl\u00e9tico Nacional in a match that could have gone either way. Deportivo Cali also competed in the 2011 Copa Sudamericana but were knocked out by Santa Fe on penalties, while in the Torneo Finalizaci\u00f3n they were unable to qualify for the semifinals. The 2012 season brought similar fortunes: the team qualified for the Apertura semifinals but narrowly missed out on the berth to the final, which ended up going to Deportivo Pasto, and in the Torneo Finalizaci\u00f3n they were placed in 11th place, thus failing to qualify for the semifinals."

        "content": "After the disappointing close to the season, Deportivo Cali decided to look for a new coach. On 13 December 2012, they signed Leonel \u00c1lvarez as their new head coach. He led Deportivo Cali to the play-offs in both of the tournaments played in 2013, reaching the final of the Torneo Finalizaci\u00f3n, but losing it to Atl\u00e9tico Nacional. The first leg was played on home soil resulting in a scoreless draw, while the second leg ended in a 2\u20130 loss. Deportivo Cali would go on to win the 2014 Superliga Colombiana against the same rival, however, \u00c1lvarez was fired after a poor start in the 2014 Apertura. In recent years, the club has become stronger with the formation of young players. In 2015, Cali won the Torneo Apertura and reached the quarterfinals of the Torneo Finalizaci\u00f3n with a squad formed mostly by youth footballers. That year, the goalscorer of the team was 21-year old Harold Preciado with 25 goals, followed by 20-year old Rafael Santos Borr\u00e9 with 11 goals and 22-year old Miguel Murillo with 10 goals. Other notable young player is 22-year old Andr\u00e9s Felipe Roa, who was called up for the senior team and played the Olympic Games play-off against United States along with his fellow mates Luis Manuel Orejuela and Kevin Balanta. For the 2016 season, the average age of the squad was 22.8 with 17 players under 21. Deportivo Cali reached another final series in the 2017 Apertura tournament, once again losing to Atl\u00e9tico Nacional after winning the first leg 2\u20130 at their stadium and losing 5\u20131 in the return leg played in Medell\u00edn. In 2021, Deportivo Cali won their tenth league title after six years. In the Torneo Apertura, they managed to advance to the knockout stages, losing to Deportes Tolima in the quarter-finals. Their Finalizaci\u00f3n campaign started with a 2\u20131 away victory against Santa Fe, however, a subsequent string of poor results caused the dismissal of manager Alfredo Arias midway into the tournament. Former Venezuelan goalkeeper Rafael Dudamel, who was champion with the team as player in 1998 took over, losing the derby to Am\u00e9rica de Cali in his debut. However, the team's performance improved, and a winning streak of four matches in the final stretch of the first stage helped them qualify for the semi-finals in seventh place. Deportivo Cali were drawn with Atl\u00e9tico Nacional, Junior, and Deportivo Pereira in their semi-final group, clinching qualification for the finals with one match in hand and a 2\u20130 win against Junior at home. In the finals, they faced Deportes Tolima, in a rematch of the quarter-final series of the previous tournament as well as the 2003 Finalizaci\u00f3n tournament finals. The first leg, played at the Estadio Deportivo Cali ended in a 1\u20131 draw, whilst in the second leg played in Ibagu\u00e9 they came from behind to win the game 2\u20131 and clinch the Primera A title. Harold Preciado, who scored two goals in the final series against Tolima, ended as the tournament's top scorer with 13 goals."

        "title": "Welling United F.C._History",
        "content": "Welling United Football Club was founded in 1963 by former professional footballer Syd Hobbins. It began as a youth team, playing in the Eltham & District Sunday League on a park pitch from 1963\u201364 to 1970\u201371. From 1971\u201372 to 1974\u201375, they played in the Metropolitan-London League Intermediate/Reserves Division. In 1975\u201376, they played in the London Spartan League Reserve Division One. They gained senior status in the London Spartan League in 1976, at Butterfly Lane, Eltham. Welling finished sixth in Division 2 in 1976\u201377 and was promoted to the Premier Division. In 1977, Welling moved to the Park View Road ground, which had previously belonged to the then defunct Bexley United. They joined the Athenian League in 1978. In 1981, they progressed to the Southern Football League Southern Division. After just one season at this level the club found itself in the Southern League Premier Division after the league was re-organised. In 1985\u201386, they won the league title by 23 points and were promoted to the Football Conference. Although they struggled in the Conference, only twice finishing above 11th place in 14 seasons, they did enjoy cup success during this period, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup in six successive seasons, on one occasion knocking out Kent's only Football League side, Gillingham. They also made one third round appearance, losing 1\u20130 at Park View Road to Blackburn Rovers. The club was relegated in 1999\u20132000 and returned to the Southern League. In the 2003\u201304 season, under the management of former England World Cup player Paul Parker, the Wings finished in the top half of the Southern League Premier Division and was therefore able to claim a place in the newly formed Conference South. In that season, Parker left the club by mutual consent. Former Coventry City and Republic of Ireland player Liam Daish took charge of the team on a caretaker basis before the permanent position was handed to former Norwich City and Gillingham defender Adrian Pennock, who narrowly missed out on taking the club into the promotion play-offs. Pennock left the club at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. His last game managing the Wings finished in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Hayes. Pennock joined Stoke City in a coaching position under his former Gillingham manager, Tony Pulis. On 16 May 2007, Welling United appointed Neil Smith as the new first team manager. However, after only seven months in charge Smith parted company with the club on 7 January 2008. It was mutually agreed between the club and Smith that his reign as Wings boss would end. Andy Ford was appointed the new manager of the Wings on 31 January 2008. Despite losing 6\u20132 to Cambridge City in his first game in charge, Ford guided the Wings to safety and they eventually finished 16th. Welling finished 7th in the Conference South in 2008/09 under the guidance of Ford. After a poor start to the 2009\u201310 season Ford resigned, stating he didn't think he could achieve what he wanted on the current budget. Jamie Day was announced as the new player/manager in November 2009. On 12 August 2010, the club was served with a winding-up petition by HMRC, due for a hearing later that month. The Wings were given 14 weeks to pay the outstanding debt to the HMRC, and thanks almost entirely to the supporters were able to raise \u00a360,000 to clear all monies owed. During this period, in a Football Conference Hearing on 16 September 2010, Welling United admitted to a misconduct charge in connection with the outstanding HMRC debt. Resultantly an immediate deduction of 5 points was enforced on the club together with a suspended \u00a35,000 fine. Despite the Wings having a transfer embargo enforced upon them and also being deducted 5 points by the Football Conference, all within four weeks of the start of 2010\u201311 season, Jamie Day's side were competitively competing for the Conference South title. However, even though Welling United were in the top 5 for almost half of the season, a string of poor results in the final month of the campaign saw the Wings miss out on a play-off place by one point, with a final position of 6th. The 2011\u201312 season ended with Welling in 3rd place and after defeating Sutton United 2\u20131 on aggregate in the play-off semi-finals they narrowly missed promotion in the final, going down 0\u20131 to Dartford at Princes Park. Welling made a return to the top level of non-league football the following season after clinching the Conference South title, 13 years after they last played at the fifth tier of English football. Between 3 November and 5 February, Welling also broke the league's record for consecutive wins with 12 in a row. In December 2014 Jamie Day left Welling by mutual consent. He was replaced by Jake Gallagher and Jamie Turner as caretakers, but on 21 December it was announced that Jody Brown of Grays Athletic would become manager. On 3 March 2015, Jody Brown was relieved of his duties after just one point in his first nine games. Right back Loui Fazakerley was put in charge for \"the foreseeable future\". Welling's first televised home match was played on 8 March 2015 in front of the BT Sport cameras losing 1\u20130 to Altrincham. Following an impressive run of results, Fazakerley steered The Wings out of the relegation zone and to Conference Premier safety on goal difference above Alfreton Town. Fazakerley was appointed on a full-time basis the same week. On 25 January 2016 Loui Fazakerley was sacked after 10 months in charge, with the club in the National League relegation zone and was replaced with former first team coach under Jamie Day, Dean Frost and Barry Ashby as assistant manager. Jamie Turner also came back as goalkeeping coach.  Frost's first match in charge was away against FC Halifax Town and finished 1\u20131, Welling's first goal and point at The Shay. Frost left the post with 6 matches remaining in the 2015\u201316 season with the club bottom of the league. Mark Goldberg was appointed manager for the coming season along with Damian Mathew as his assistant. After a poor start to the season Golberg gave more control to Mathew but that proved short lived as Mathew left the club in the wake of a capitulation from 2\u20130 at home to Hemel Hempstead Town, losing the match 3\u20132.  Former manager Jamie Day returned to the club as assistant to Goldberg but results still did not improve. Day was appointed manager, which culminated in a run that saw Day awarded National League South Manager of the Month, December 2016, and talisman Adam Coombes named player for the month.  Day was being assisted by Adrian Pennock, acting as football consultant. In January 2017, more upheaval was to follow when Pennock left for Gillingham, as manager, taking Day with him as assistant. Coach, Harry Wheeler and Tristan Lewis were drafted in to cover in the short term. With the 2016/17 season nearing close, former Charlton Athletic assistant manager Alex Dyer was appointed manager in March 2017. Assisted by Tristan Lewis, Dyer guided Welling for the remainder of the season, and finished the 2016\u201317 campaign with a 2\u20130 loss to Dover Athletic in the Kent Senior Cup final.  In May 2017, Jamie Coyle became Welling United manager, with Tristan Lewis appointed to Director of Football. In February 2018 it was announced that Coyle had signed a contract extension to manage the Wings for the 2018\u201319 season. With the season ended three days earlier, and the club missing out on a play-off berth, it was announced on 1 May 2018 that Coyle had stepped down from his role as first-team manager. On 3 May 2018, Director of Football, Tristan Lewis also left for pastures new, with the club singling out his work; in establishing their academy, and co-managing the team alongside Mark Goldberg, Harry Wheeler, Alex Dyer and Jamie Coyle, for praise. Steve King was next to be appointed manager, after he joined from recently relegated Whitehawk at the end of May. A successful season was to follow with the Wings finishing in 3rd place and top of the home form table; meaning that the club had qualified for the playoffs for only the second time in its history. In the semi-final at Park View Road, Welling defeated Chelmsford City 3-2 courtesy of a 96th minute Brendan Kiernan penalty, thus setting up a draw in the final away at Woking. The hosts won the game 1-0 after Armani Little scored a free-kick just before half-time. This proved to be King's final game in charge as manager as he was replaced in June 2019 by Goldberg, who returned for his second spell in the dugout.  Bradley Quinton became the club's new manager in January 2020."

This ground has been their home since 1977 when they took over the ground which had been vacated by the defunct Bexley United. Prior to that date the club had played at a community sports ground in Butterfly Lane, Eltham. Having been unoccupied for some time, the new ground was almost derelict. Erith & Belvedere have been ground sharing since the 1999 season. Improvements were made to the Park View Road ground in 2004, which included a new covered stand. As a result of severe storms and gale-force winds in December 2006, the floodlights at Park View Road were damaged. Due to safety reasons all the floodlight pylons on the Welling side of the ground were removed. The floodlights were put in place during the month of June 2007 and are fully functional, one pylon positioned in each corner. During the 2013\u201314 season, Park View Road had to be changed to keep Welling United in the Conference Premier in the 2014\u201315 season. These all happened between the months of February and March. In the close season of 2015\u201316 both Welling United bars, the boardroom and parking area at Park View Road underwent renovations. In particular the hospitality areas at the ground were fully refitted to cater for match-days, and non-football related events and private bookings."

At Wolves, De Vries primarily served as back-up to Wayne Hennessey and initially only gained playing time in cup competitions. He made his club debut on 23 August 2011 in a 4\u20130 League Cup win at Northampton Town. When first choice goalkeeper Hennessey suffered a torn cruciate knee ligament in April 2012, De Vries made his first-ever Premier League appearance. However, by this stage Wolves had become rooted in the relegation zone and the 0\u20132 defeat against eventual champions Manchester City on De Vries' league debut confirmed their relegation back to the Championship. De Vries remained in the Wolves' goal for their remaining fixtures, including a trip to his former club Swansea, before which he said that he has no regrets about his decision to leave Swansea and join Wolves; he received mixed reception from Swansea fans and went on to concede four times in a 4\u20134 draw. Following relegation, De Vries was a target for Liverpool following their appointment of former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers as manager, but their bid of a reported \u00a3500,000 was not accepted. With the new season beginning with Wayne Hennessey still sidelined through injury, new Wolves manager St\u00e5le Solbakken opted to instead start with Carl Ikeme in goal. His only start under Solbakken came in a League Cup loss at Chelsea, during which the goalkeeper conceded six times. In late October Solbakken admitted that he and De Vries had had an angry confrontation regarding his lack of opportunities. For a second consecutive season his chance to play league football only arrived through injury, when Ikeme suffered a self-inflicted broken hand in March 2013. He played in all of Wolves' remaining fixtures as the team again struggled unsuccessfully to avoid relegation under another manager, Dean Saunders. Following relegation to League One, Saunders was fired and replaced by Kenny Jackett, who has stated that De Vries was free to leave on a free transfer as he sought to slim down the squad."

De Vries was again second choice in 2014\u20132015, eventually displacing Darlow for a spell including the 2\u20131 derby win over Derby County, but Darlow was re-instated by Dougie Freedman, immediately on replacing Stuart Pearce as manager.

De Vries made only one appearance in the entire 2017 calendar year: a 1\u20130 win over Dundee on 14 October. On 27 January 2018, De Vries replaced Gordon at half-time shortly after the latter suffered a knee injury in the 1\u20130 win over Hibernian.

Celtic exited the Europa League after a 3\u20131 aggregate defeat to Zenit; the Russians' second goal, described by De Vries as a \"knuckleball\", deceived him, and it is his belief that his side never recovered from that concession. De Vries was injured in training on 9 March and replaced by Scott Bain in the match with Rangers two days later, and made no further appearances in the 2017\u201318 season, finishing with 10 appearances: two in the Scottish Cup, two in the Europa League, and six in the League.

The next year Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 IF also joined the project. The newly formed club started out their existence in the third tier in 1997 and \u00d6stersund/Torvalla FF ceased to exist as a consequence. IFK \u00d6stersund, Ope IF och \u00d6stersund/Torvalla FF . In 2000 a fifth club, F\u00e4ltj\u00e4garnas IF, was also merged into the club. During the 2000s the club started taking on an English flavour and in 2007 the director of football Daniel Kindberg used his friendship with coaches Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Graeme Jones to start a cooperation with Swansea City where \u00d6stersund would loan young players from the club. Swansea also came over to \u00d6stersund to play the inauguration game at the newly built stadium. After a poor 2010 season the club was relegated to the fourth tier for the first time ever. In 2011 Daniel Kindberg returned to the role as director of football and increased financial backing from local companies which enabled the hiring of more full-time staff. Following Jones' recommendation the club also brought in young English manager Graham Potter who was working at an English university at the time. Through several successful signings, some coming from Potter's connections at Nike Football Academy, the club was able to win both the fourth tier and then the third tier immediately the year after. The club was promoted to Superettan for the 2013 season and finished 10th that season. In January 2014 the club announced that they had signed a half-billion kronor deal with the government of Libya to develop and educate Libyan football players. Under the terms of the deal, \u00d6stersunds FK would train 250 young men from Libya every year, except the first year in which they will receive 60 students. Those players would be taught English and computer skills in addition to sports theory and football training. The deal was expected to raise \u00d6stersund FKs yearly profits by over 50%. The deal with the Libyan state never came to life, thus meaning no students came to \u00d6stersund and no money was received by the club. On 27 October 2015, the club was promoted to Allsvenskan for the first time. In 2017, they managed to win their first major trophy, Svenska Cupen, after defeating IFK Norrk\u00f6ping 4\u20131 in the final, also qualifying for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League, marking their first appearance in a European competition tournament. In their Europa League debut in the second qualifying round on 13 July 2017, \u00d6stersunds earned a shock 2\u20130 victory against Turkish giants Galatasaray at the J\u00e4mtkraft Arena and eliminated them after a 1\u20131 draw in Istanbul. Two goals by Saman Ghoddos in a win against PAOK on 24 August saw them qualify for the Group Stage at the first time of asking, at the same time making them the only Swedish representative in the season's UEFA competition and making Graham Potter the only British manager in the Europa League Group Stage. After losing only one game in their campaign, they finished second in a group featuring Athletic Bilbao and Hertha Berlin, becoming the first Swedish club to progress beyond the Europa League group stage. In the round of 32 they managed to beat English side Arsenal 2\u20131 away but were eliminated 4\u20132 on aggregate after losing the first leg 3\u20130. On 17 April 2018, club chairman Daniel Kindberg was taken into custody by the Swedish Economic Crime Authority, suspected on probable cause of serious fraud and for assisting in serious gross accounting violations. Together with two other people, Kindberg is suspected of submitting false invoices in several companies, according to the prosecutor. Several of these companies have strong ties to \u00d6stersunds FK and the club's sponsorship deals. Several years before, in 2014, Kindberg was subject to criticism when \u00d6stersundshem, the municipal housing company where he was the CEO, became a big sponsor of \u00d6stersunds FK. On 11 June 2018, Graham Potter left \u00d6stersunds FK to take over as manager of Swansea City after eight seasons in charge. On the 31st of October in 2021 they got relegated from Allsvenskan after they lost against Varberg BoIS. In the 2022 season \u00d6stersunds FK will play in Superettan, the second tier of Swedish men's professional football. \u00d6stersund played six seasons in Allsvenskan before they got relegated."

        "content": "On January 18, 1998, Snow was acquired from Seattle by the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for a second-round draft pick. At the time of the trade, Snow was averaging just 4.4 minutes per game; Sixers head coach Larry Brown gave him a bigger role in Philadelphia. In his first full season in Philadelphia, he started every game he played in and averaged 35.8 minutes per game. As a pass-first, defensive-minded point guard, Snow became a stalwart of the Brown-era 76ers teams. Snow's ability to guard opposing teams' shooting guards made him an ideal complement to Allen Iverson, a high-scoring but unusually small shooting guard. Despite missing thirty-two games early in the 2000\u201301 season due to injury, Snow played a crucial role in helping the 76ers earn the top playoff seed in the Eastern Conference and ultimately reach the 2001 NBA Finals, where they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers. During the following season, Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant stated that nobody in the league defended him better than Snow. In 2002\u201303, Snow posted career highs in points per game , rebounds per game , minutes per game , field goal percentage , and free throw percentage . Snow's excellent free throw percentage was particularly noteworthy, as he had been a very poor foul shooter in college and early in his NBA career, averaging 52.1% from the stripe during his four seasons at Michigan State and 59.2% as a rookie. He also averaged 6.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game in 2002\u201303."

He was suspended without pay for a December 18, 2004 game against the Boston Celtics after a confrontation with Paul Silas, the coach of the Cavaliers. It was the only game that Snow missed in his first three years with the Cavaliers. He had a season-high 16 points on January 22, 2005 against the Golden State Warriors and a season-high 13 assists on April 19, 2005 against the Boston Celtics . Snow ranked fifth in the NBA in assist-to-turnover ratio ; he donated $20 for every one of his steals and assists during the 2004\u201305 season. Snow played in and started all 82 games for the Cavaliers in the 2005-06 season, helping the Cavaliers return to the playoffs for the first time since 1998. He started all 13 playoff games for the Cavaliers. He scored 18 points in a Game 5 victory over the Washington Wizards during the first round of the playoffs before losing to the Detroit Pistons in 7 games in the semifinals. The following season, for the fifth and final time in his career, Snow played in all 82 games. He had a season high 18 points on January 13, 2007 against the Los Angeles Clippers and a season-high 11 assists on January 20, 2007 against the Golden State Warriors. However, he gradually lost playing time through the course of the season to Daniel Gibson, until he came off the bench on January 30, 2007, bringing an end to Snow's streak of starts that lasted for 127 games. The Cavaliers made the NBA Finals and lost to the San Antonio Spurs in a sweep that year. In his 13th NBA season, Snow was named team co-captain, along with LeBron James. Snow only played in 22 games that season. On March 11, 2008, it was announced that Snow would miss four to six weeks due to arthritic-related symptoms in his left knee, ending his season. After the injury, Snow conceded that he likely would not play in the NBA again. Unable to play, but still listed as an active player on the Cavaliers' roster, Snow served on Head Coach Mike Brown's staff as an unofficial assistant coach for the 2008-09 season. On April 4, 2009, Snow was given a \"medically necessary\" release and began working as an analyst for NBA TV."

Since winning its first championship in 1910, Libertad has always been overshadowed by the two big clubs in Paraguay: Olimpia and Cerro Porte\u00f1o, who together won most of the Paraguayan football national championships. Despite that, Libertad has confirmed its position as the third \"big\" team of Paraguay by winning 21 championships, ten more than Guaran\u00ed, which has eleven. In 1952, Libertad participated in the Copa Rio. The club played three matches. In the first match against Austria Wien, the opposition won 4-2. In the next match, against Corinthians, the Brazilians won 6-1. In its last game against German club 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken, the Paraguayan club won 4-1, to finish the cup with 1 win and 2 defeats. The club's first participation in the Copa Libertadores was in 1968, where they finished last with one win, one draw and 4 losses in a group containing Pe\u00f1arol, Nacional, and Guaran\u00ed. In the 1977 Copa Libertadores Libertad reached the semi-finals. They began their campaign by finishing 1st in their group. That gave them qualification to the semi-finals, where they had to play two legs against Boca Juniors and Deportivo Cali. The winner of the group advanced to the finals, which was Boca Juniors. Libertad finished last of the semi-finals group with one win one draw and two losses. In 1998, the club was relegated for the first time in its history. In the Apertura tournament, it finished last, and in the Clausura, it finished second-to-last. A 4-3 defeat to rivals Guaran\u00ed on the last matchday, as well as their league position in 1997, secured the club's relegation. The club spent two years in the second tier before returning to the top tier in 2001 after winning the league title in 2000. The club went through lots of success after their return to the top tier, as noted by winning the league titles in 2002 and 2003. Libertad reached the semi-finals of Copa Libertadores for the second time in history in 2006, where Libertad topped its group and beat powerhouses Corinthians and River Plate on their way to being knocked out by winners Internacional. Despite the elimination, more success came for the club, because it became a three-time-champion by winning the 2007 Clausura, 2008 Apertura, and 2008 Clausura. In the 2013 Copa Sudamericana, the club made the semi-finals, beginning their campaign in the first stage by beating Montevideo Wanderers and Mineros in the second stage. Then they beat Sport Recife and Itagui in the knockout stage before being eliminated by Lan\u00fas, who eventually won the competition. They also made the semi-finals again in 2017, losing to another Argentine club, Independiente, who also won the competition."

He had been selected in the 4th round, 83rd overall, of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft following a successful career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with the Granby Bisons. Montreal already had established first team duo Patrick Roy and Brian Hayward who had won three William M. Jennings Trophy in a row from 1986 to 1989. As a result, Racicots first season was spent largely on the Sherbrooke Canadiens farm team, but he finally made his NHL debut on December 9, 1989, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, were he allowed three goals on six shots in just less than 13 minutes before being replaced. It was his only NHL appearance of the 1989\u201390 NHL season. He shared the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award for fewest goals allowed in the AHL in 1990 with fellow understudy Jean-Claude Bergeron. The 1990\u201391 season saw regular understudy Haywards traded to the Minnesota North Stars. As a result, Racicot split time with the Fredericton Canadiens and Montreal, as he battled with Jean-Claude Bergeron and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chabot for second string duties. The following 1991\u201392 season saw Roland Melanson brought in as an experienced backup, reducing Racicots opportunities significantly as he again spent a large portion of the season with Federicton. In his 9 appearances for Montreal he was winless, while Roy appeared in 67 games to earn another Jennings Trophy. In 1992-93 Racicot had his most successful season for Montreal. While Roy appeared in the lions share of games Racicot saw action in 26 games, winning 17. The Canadiens made their way to the Stanley Cup Final. Racicot saw only 18 minutes of action in the playoffs as Roy backstopped the unfancied Montreal to their first Stanley Cup win since 1986. The following year Racicot again faced competition for his second string position, with Ron Tugnutt and Les Kuntar splitting playing time. His performances dipped, and ultimately he was released at the end of the 1994 season. Racicot left the NHL after the 1994 season, spending several seasons with various teams in the AHL, International Hockey League, and East Coast Hockey League. The 1999\u20132000 season saw Racicot move to Russia, playing in 20 games with HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk before returning to North America for another five seasons of minor-pro hockey. He retired as a player in 2004."

Prior to the season, the legacy of the Dayton Triangles, the final remaining Ohio League member and the franchise then known as the New York Yanks owner Ted Collins sold his team back to the NFL. A few days later, a new team was then awarded to an ownership group in Dallas, Texas, after it purchased the assets of the Yanks. However, the new Dallas Texans went  and were sold back to the league midway through the season. For the team's last five games, the league operated the Texans as a road team, with the franchise \"returning to its roots\" as a traveling team just as they were in the 1920s when they were known as the Dayton Triangles, with them becoming the final traveling team to date in NFL history, using Hershey, Pennsylvania, as a home base. One of their final two \"home\" games were held at the Rubber Bowl in Akron, Ohio, the other one played at the opposing team's stadium. After the season ended, the league considers the Texans to have folded, however all of the Triangles-Texans players and assets were awarded to Carroll Rosenbloom for the following year, becoming the new Baltimore Colts, keeping the blue and white color scheme, and the assets of the franchise ultimately never missing a season in some form.  This left Dallas without a professional football franchise until the births of the Dallas Cowboys and the AFL version of the Dallas Texans in 1960. The Detroit Lions defeated the Cleveland Browns in the NFL Championship Game. This was the last NFL season prior to the introduction of regular season overtime in 1974 that there were no ties in the regular season."

        "content": "In Week One , the Cleveland Browns hosted a rematch of their 1951 title game loss to the Rams, which had taken place in Los Angeles.  That 24\u201317 loss was avenged with a 37\u20137 win for the Browns.  The NFL's newest team, the Dallas Texans, played their first game, but a crowd of only 17,499 turned out to watch the visiting Giants.  The Texans scored first, on a pass from George Taliaferro to Buddy Young, two of the few African-American players in the NFL at that time.  The Giants scored the rest of the points in a 24\u20136 win. Week Three the Giants beat the Browns 17\u20139, and the 49ers shut out the Lions 28\u20130, as both stayed unbeaten on the road. Week Four saw the 49ers stay unbeaten with a 40\u201318 win over the Bears, while the Chicago Cardinals spoiled the Giants' home opener, 24\u201323. San Francisco's streak finally ended on November 2 in Week Six when the Bears visited.  The 49ers were leading, 17\u201310 in the 4th quarter, when Frankie Albert made an unnecessary gamble in a 4th and 4 on his own 31-yard line, trying to gain yardage on a fake punt.  Chicago took over on downs and tied the game three plays later, and George Blanda's 48-yard field goal gave them a 20\u201317 win. In Week Seven , the 49ers lost in New York, 23\u201314, while Detroit beat Pittsburgh 31\u20136 and Cleveland beat the Cardinals 28\u201313.  Both conference races were tied, with the Giants and Browns in the American, and the Lions joining the 49ers in the National, all with 5\u20132\u20130 records.  In Dallas, only 10,000 turned out in a drizzle to watch the Texans fall to 0\u20137\u20130 in a 27\u20136 loss to the Rams.  It proved to be the Texans' last Cotton Bowl date, and the last pro football game played in the state of Texas until 1960.  After losses of $250,000 and failed attempts to get refinancing, the team's 16 stockholders surrendered the franchise three days later, the league took over its operations, and the remaining games in Dallas were moved.<ref>\"Dallas Texans Go Broke; Team Goes Back to League,\" The Lowell Sun, Nov 13, 1952, p29</ref> In Week Eight the Browns had a 22\u20130 lead over Pittsburgh and then withstood a four touchdown passing attack by Jim Finks in a 29\u201328 win.  A safety, caused when Finks had been sacked in the end zone earlier, was the margin of victory.  With the Giants' 17\u20133 loss to Green Bay, Cleveland took over first place in the American Conference.  Meanwhile, Detroit and San Francisco both won to stay tied in the National. Week Nine saw a seven-way tie for the NFL's best record, with more than half of the teams at 6\u20133\u20130, and only three games left in the season.  The 5\u20133 Rams beat the 6\u20132 49ers 35\u20139, and the 5\u20133 Eagles beat the 6\u20132 Browns 28\u201320.  The 3\u20135 Bears upset the visiting 6\u20132 Lions, 24\u201323, after George Blanda passed to Ed Sprinkle with 8 seconds to play.  In addition, the 5\u20133 Giants and the 5\u20133 Packers won their games against Washington and Dallas respectively. This oddity only lasted a few days. Week Ten began on Thanksgiving Day, as the Lions beat the Packers 48\u201324.  The same day, November 27, the 0\u20139\u20130 Texans played the Bears in Akron, Ohio after Dallas and Chicago were both unavailable.  The Texans blew an 18-point lead, but with 0:34 to play, Frank Tripucka scored and the NFL's orphaned team registered its first win, 27\u201323.  About 3,000 Ohioans watched the game, compared to 14,800 who packed the stadium earlier that day to watch a high school game.  On November 30, the Rams and 49ers, both 6\u20133\u20130, met for the second straight week, this time in San Francisco, and the L.A. team won 34\u201321.  The NFL's two other 6\u20133 teams, the Eagles and the Giants, both lost on the road.  The Cards beat Philly 28\u201322.  The 3\u20136 Steelers, however, handed the Giants their worst defeat ever, beginning with a 91-yard return of the opening kickoff by Lynn Chandnois and ending 63\u20137.  With that, the Browns were alone in the American race, while the Lions and Rams were tied in the National. The Browns, Lions and Rams won again in Week Eleven, as did Philadelphia, but the Giants were eliminated with a 27\u201317 loss to Washington. In the final games of the regular season in Week Twelve, Detroit won 41\u20136 in the last NFL game for the Dallas Texans, and the Rams beat Pittsburgh 28\u201314, tying both for the American title at 9\u20133\u20130, and forcing a playoff.  In the National Conference, the 7\u20134 Eagles were hoping for the 8\u20133 Browns to lose, and Cleveland fell in New York, 37\u201334, despite a fourth quarter comeback attempt.  Playing against the last place Redskins, the Eagles had a 21\u201314 lead in the fourth quarter, but Eddie LeBaron crossed the goal line with 0:18 to play, for Washington's only home win in 1952, and handing the Browns the conference title."

The team was established after Paul Stoddart sold his remaining interest in the Minardi team at the end of 2005 to Red Bull's owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, and Minardi was renamed Toro Rosso. Mateschitz subsequently struck a 50/50 joint-ownership deal with former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger before the start of the season. In late November 2008, Red Bull regained total ownership of Toro Rosso after buying back Berger's share of the team. From  to , Toro Rosso used Ferrari V8 engines, taking over the contract that their senior team broke from at the end of 2006 to switch engine builders to Renault. For , Toro Rosso switched to Renault engines as well, but in  returned to using Ferrari power. However, they switched back to Renault in  , then in  to Honda. The team principal was Franz Tost, formerly of BMW's motor sport division. Vitantonio Liuzzi scored the team's first point in its first season at the 2006 United States Grand Prix. The team's first podium and only pole position and victory were scored by Sebastian Vettel at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. Max Verstappen became the youngest driver to compete in Formula One, at 17 years and 166 days old, in a Toro Rosso at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix."

Despite having a large fan base, it had been one of the least competitive teams in the sport, never achieving a podium finish and only finishing as high as fourth in three races. Minardi owner Paul Stoddart claimed to have had 41 approaches to buy the team, but preferred to sell it to someone who could 'take it further' than he could and who would maintain it in its traditional base in Italy. Included in the terms of the deal with Red Bull GmbH was the clause that the team must keep its headquarters in Faenza, Italy until at least the  season. Whilst Red Bull abandoned the Minardi name in line with their own sponsorship and marketing plans, the use of the Italian language in the name was intended to hint at the team's Italian heritage. Red Bull changed the name of the team immediately after taking control of the team on 1 November 2005. It was initially reported as 'Squadra Toro Rosso' but then changed because squadra in Italian depicts a 'squad' like a football team, to 'Scuderia Toro Rosso'. Scuderia is Italian for a stable reserved for racing horses, and is also commonly applied to Italian motor racing teams, such as Ferrari. Many Minardi fans were upset by the name change to Scuderia Toro Rosso and over 15,000 signed an online petition to keep the Minardi name, but were unsuccessful."

Liuzzi had raced part-time for Red Bull Racing in 2005, while Speed entered F1 following the Red Bull Driver Search in the United States. Jani was the test driver for Sauber Petronas in 2004. The 2006 chassis was a modified version of the 2005 Red Bull Racing RB1. Some teams felt that this infringed the Concorde Agreement as each team is expected to design their own car. Toro Rosso claim that this design was originally produced during 2004 by Jaguar Racing, Red Bull's predecessor, and that the intellectual rights had belonged to the Ford Motor Company, Jaguar Racing's parent company before passing to Toro Rosso. The team used Minardi's contracted supply of rev limited and air restricted 2005-spec Cosworth TJ2005-2 3.0-litre V10 engines instead of newly-built Cosworth CA2006 2.4-litre V8 engines as CA2006 engines were too expensive for smaller teams. This concession had been granted to assist less well funded teams by avoiding the cost of sourcing a new supply of V8 engines as required by the 2006 regulations. The continuation of this arrangement after the Red Bull takeover caused friction with other teams, in particular Super Aguri and Midland who felt that the engine conferred too much of an advantage. They contended that the concession to allow the team use a V10 engine was based on Minardi's poor financial situation, and should not have continued to apply after the team achieved a completely different financial footing. For tyre suppliers, Toro Rosso was reunited with Michelin tyres who last time collaborated with Faenza-based Minardi Formula One team in 2001 and 2002 seasons. As the season progressed, the Toro Rossos began to struggle in qualifying as their competitors developed their new V8 engines to rev closer to 20,000 rpm to get more power. To try to balance the playing field, Toro Rosso asked for an extra 500 rpm for qualifying, however the FIA permitted them only 300 rpm."

Bourdais earned his first career points with a 7th-place finish at the Australian Grand Prix. Vettel scored his first points of the season with a 5th-place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix. The team showed steady improvement throughout the season, leading up to a solid performance at the Belgian Grand Prix which saw both cars running in the top six for most of the race, and with Bourdais and Vettel running 3rd and 4th respectively on the final lap until cars on tyres better suited to the extreme wet conditions passed them, demoting Vettel to 5th and Bourdais to 7th. The double points finish moved STR above Honda and level with Williams in the Constructors' Championship. The team pulled off a massive shock at the wet Italian Grand Prix, with Vettel claiming a first pole position and the first win for both himself and the team. This was the first win by a team based in Italy other than Ferrari since the 1957 German Grand Prix, which was won by Juan Manuel Fangio in a Maserati and also the first and only win for a Ferrari engine in a customer chassis. Vettel beat second-place Heikki Kovalainen by 12 seconds. Vettel was at it again in the next race, the Singapore Grand Prix, Formula One's first ever night race. Vettel qualified 7th and finished the race in 5th, while Bourdais could only manage 12th. At the next race in Japan, Vettel again showed his class finishing 6th. Bourdais, meanwhile, was doing well, until Felipe Massa, who had been running in 8th, tried to overtake Bourdais. Massa had climbed up to 8th place after having dropped down to 13th as a result of his drive-through and his first pit-stop. Just after Bourdais left the pitlane after making his final stop, Massa attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the track and eventually finished 8th. Bourdais finished the race in 6th place, but had 25 seconds added to his overall time as penalty for the incident, dropping him down to 10th place. This ultimately had the effect of promoting Massa to 7th place, and giving him an extra championship point. It was a controversial penalty, and Bourdais was adamant that he was not to blame. Vettel's performances earned him a place at the senior Red Bull team for 2009. However, his final drive for Toro Rosso saw him almost play a crucial role in the world championship decider in Brazil. In mixed conditions, Lewis Hamilton needed 5th place to clinch the championship, and was running in this position when he was overtaken by Vettel with two laps remaining. Unable to keep up, Hamilton dropped back, and only took the title when he and Vettel both overtook Timo Glock on the final lap. In the end, Vettel scored 35 of the team's 39 points, and in doing so, helped Toro Rosso to actually outperform their senior Red Bull team for the first and only time in team history."

Hartley retired from the race in Italy after a first-lap collision, before both drivers suffered brake failures in Russia, coincidentally at almost exactly the same time. Both drivers impressed in Japan, qualifying in 6th and 7th, but both would finish outside the points. Two more points finishes came before the end of the season, 9th place for Hartley in the United States\u2014the best result of his career\u2014and 10th place for Gasly in Mexico. The team finished the season in 9th place in the championship with 33 points, 29 for Gasly and four for Hartley."

        "content": "Pierre Gasly was promoted to Red Bull for 2019. His replacement at Toro Rosso was Daniil Kvyat\u2014re-hired by the team after he was previously dropped in 2017. Brendon Hartley was replaced by 2018 Formula 2 third-place finisher Alexander Albon. Kvyat finished 10th at the opening race in Australia, keeping Red Bull's newly promoted Gasly behind him for much of the race. Albon scored his first Formula One points with a 9th place in Bahrain, before finishing 10th in China after starting from the pit lane. Kvyat suffered consecutive collision-related retirements in China and in Azerbaijan. Toro Rosso recorded a double points-finish in Monaco, the first time the team had done so in over two years since the 2017 Spanish Grand Prix. The team scored an excellent result at the rain-affected German Grand Prix, where clever strategy calls allowed Kvyat and Albon to finish 3rd and 6th respectively. This was Toro Rosso's first podium finish since their shock win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix, and their best ever race result in terms of total points. Prior to the Belgian Grand Prix, Albon left the team after being promoted to Red Bull, replacing Gasly who returned to Toro Rosso. A number of consistent points-finishes followed, as the STR14 demonstrated its ability to fight at the front of the midfield. This included 7th and 9th in Belgium and 7th and 10th in Japan. At the chaotic Brazilian Grand Prix, Toro Rosso claimed their third podium finish. Gasly took advantage of multiple incidents and held off Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes in a drag race to the finish line to finish 2nd. In the final race, Danill Kvyat finished ninth to give the team their 500th point. Over the course of 2019, Toro Rosso only suffered a single reliability-related retirement, Kvyat's oil leak in Italy. This is in stark contrast to 2018, with seven such retirements. This consistency was rewarded as the team ended the season in 6th place in the championship with 85 points, their best ever points haul in the team's history."

The post, which enabled him to continue his playing career with Canvey Island, saw him responsible for overseeing and developing all of the centre's teams, raging from the under-9 to 16. Following the departure of David Webb as Southend United's manager in October 2001 and the promotion of Rob Newman from reserve team manager to first team manager, Tilson's role widened to take on Newman's previous duties with the reserve team. In May 2002, he drew time on his five-year career with Canvey Island to join Newman's backroom team on a full-time basis becoming joint assistant manager with Blues' former striker David Crown. Tilson worked to develop Southend's youth until the sacking of Steve Wignall in November 2003. With the club in danger of relegation to the Football Conference, Tilson was named caretaker-manager by chairman Ron Martin and proceeded to take Southend clear of danger. Also in the same season, Tilson led Southend to the first ever national cup final in the club's history, losing to Blackpool 2\u20130 in the Football League Trophy Final. In March 2004 Tilson was offered the job of manager on a full-time basis, and accepted the offer. In the following two seasons, Tilson took Southend to two consecutive promotions from League Two to the Championship. Southend also reached another Football League Trophy Final in 2005, but lost to Wrexham. Tilson's success saw him linked with jobs at West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City, but he remained with Southend. In November 2006, Southend achieved a notable victory over eventual Premier League champions Manchester United in the League Cup, but were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. On 3 January 2009, Tilson led Southend to a 1\u20131 FA Cup third round draw away at Chelsea, with Peter Clarke scoring a very late birthday equaliser. On 28 October 2009, following the club being threatened with administration and on-loan midfielder Lee Sawyer returning to Chelsea, Tilson came out of retirement to play for Southend in the Essex Senior Cup. On 4 July 2010, Steve Tilson was placed on gardening leave by Southend United, bringing an end to his seven-year reign as manager."

The new team contained a mix of Stewarts & Lloyds and new players, and took over from Stewarts and Lloyds in the United Counties League. Their first league match saw them win 5\u20131 against Wellingborough Town. They went on to win back-to-back league titles in 1950\u201351 and 1951\u201352, after which they joined the Midland League as it was expanded to 24 clubs, with the reserve team taking the club's place in the United Counties League. Having signed sixteen new players, many of whom had played in the Football League, they went into the final match of the season on 1 May 1953 sitting level at the top of the table with Nottingham Forest reserves, who were the visitors to Corby for the final match. In front of a crowd of 6,294, Corby lost the match and Forest reserves won the title by two points. In 1954\u201355 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 2\u20130 at home to Watford. In 1958 Corby transferred to the Southern League, spending their first season in the North-Western Division, before being placed in Division One for the 1959\u201360 season. Despite only finishing sixth in 1961\u201362, Corby applied for election to the Football League. However, they failed to receive a single vote. After finishing seventh the following season the club applied again, and again received no votes. In 1963\u201364 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for a second time, losing 3\u20131 at home to Bristol City. They appeared in the first round again the following season, losing 3\u20131 at home to Hartlepools United. The season also saw them finish fourth in Division One, earning promotion to the Premier Division, as well as making another failed bid for Football League membership. In 1965\u201366 Corby progressed beyond the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating non-League Burton Albion 6\u20133 in the first round, they won 1\u20130 at Luton Town in a second round replay after the first match ended 2\u20132. In the third round they were beaten 6\u20130 at Plymouth Argyle. The club applied for Football League membership for a fourth time, and for the first time received a single vote for their unsuccessful bid. The club made their final application in 1966\u201367, again receiving no votes. The following season saw another FA Cup first round appearance but ended in relegation to Division One. In 1971 the club were placed in Division One North after league reorganisation. Further reorganisation in 1979 and 1982 saw them placed in the Midland Division and then the Premier Division. Corby remained in the Premier Division until being relegated at the end of the 1989\u201390 season, but made an immediate return to the Premier Division after finishing as Division One Midlands runners-up in 1990\u201391. After finishing bottom of the Premier Division in 1994\u201395, the club were relegated again. In 1998 they were moved to the Division One South, and then were placed in Division One East for the 1999\u20132000 season. After being transferred to Division One West in 2004, they were moved back to Division One East the following season. In 2005\u201306 they finished second, and were promoted to the Premier Division. The 2008\u201309 season saw Corby win the Premier Division, earning promotion to the Conference North. In 2010\u201311 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time since the 1960s, losing 4\u20132 to Luton Town in a replay. They appeared in the first round again the following season, losing 3\u20131 at Bristol Rovers. After four seasons in the Conference North, Corby were relegated at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. They were Southern League Premier Division champions again in 2014\u201315 and were promoted back to the renamed National League North. However, another relegation in 2015\u201316 saw the club relegated to the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League. The club were transferred to Division One East of the Southern League at the end of the 2017\u201318 season as part of the restructuring of the non-League pyramid. The following season saw the club transferred to Division One Central of the Southern League. At the end of the 2020\u201321 season they were transferred to Division One Midlands of the Northern Premier League."

        "content": "When the competition was known as the Victorian Football League , the league introduced the first incarnation of a draft system in 1981, where teams had two selections each of interstate players determined by reverse finishing position order. The draft was introduced as an equalisation strategy in response to the increasing transfer fees and player salaries at the time, which in combination with declining attendances threatened to derail the league. It was also a result of the failure of country zoning, introduced in 1967, which had led to a systematic inequality whereby the clubs with the best zones, like Carlton and Hawthorn, could dominate over clubs with poorer zones like Melbourne. In 1986, the first of the modern VFL Drafts was held. The draft was run in conjunction to the existing zone system. Players from West Australian Football League and the new West Coast Eagles were excluded from the 1986 draft, with the Eagles able to recruit up to 35 West Australian players with no more than 6 players from any single WAFL club. The other new club for the 1987 VFL season, the Brisbane Bears, received 6 concessionary picks before the other clubs and exclusive access to all Queensland based players. Since then, the rules associated with priority picks, zone allocations, the father\u2013son rule, mid-year, pre-season and rookie drafts, expansion clubs concessions and trading of players and picks have been frequently changed, but the basic premise of draft being an equalisation measure to assist the poorer performed teams has remained."

This was increased over the past few years due to concerns about school age players potentially having to leave home to play football interstate.

This replaced a system in which a priority draft pick was automatically given to team whose win-loss record fell below a pre-defined value; this had become controversial, and there were accusations by commentators that teams out of finals contention would tank at the end of the season to gain access to the additional draft picks, although the AFL itself never brought such accusations against any club."

For clubs with an established history in the VFL/AFL , the father must have played at least 100 games for the club to be eligible for the father/son rule; clubs with no long term history in the league have different eligibility criteria based on their state leagues. Under current rules, players eligible under the father\u2013son rule are selected in a bidding system prior to the draft. Firstly, any club in the league may nominate a draft pick with which it intends to take the eligible son; then, if the father's club wishes to draft the son, it must use its next available draft pick, after the highest bidder. Earlier versions of the father\u2013son rule allowed the sons to be recruited automatically, without need for the draft, or allowed the club to recruit the son using a third round draft pick. The father\u2013son rule itself was introduced in 1959, more than two decades prior to the draft, and it could be used to contravene zoning rules. In 2017, the second season of the AFL women's competition the AFL introduced a father\u2013daughter rule, where a daughter could be drafted if the father played one game at the club."

        "content": "Joining the Hurricanes for the 2005\u201306 NHL season, Ward largely served in a backup role to Swiss goalie Martin Gerber during the regular season. He made his NHL debut on October 5, 2005, replacing Gerber after the starter injured his hamstring. He saved 10 of 11 shots in the third period, as the Hurricanes lost 5\u20132 to the Tampa Bay Lightning. He made his first NHL start the following game two days later in the club's home opener against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Ward turned aside Mario Lemieux, \u017digmund P\u00e1lffy and Sidney Crosby in a shootout, as the Hurricanes won 3\u20132. Ward completed his NHL rookie season with 14 wins and 8 losses, along with a 3.68 goals against average. In the opening round of the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Hurricanes faced a two-win deficit against the Montreal Canadiens. With Gerber struggling in the series, Hurricanes coach Peter Laviolette turned to Ward. The goaltending switch prompted Carolina to a series comeback, advancing to the second round against the New Jersey Devils, where he played opposite his personal hero, Martin Brodeur. After eliminating the Devils, the Hurricanes defeated the Buffalo Sabres in seven games. Facing the Edmonton Oilers in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, he helped the Hurricanes to the franchise's first Stanley Cup. In doing so, he became the first rookie goaltender to lead his team to the Stanley Cup as a starter since Patrick Roy in 1986. Against Edmonton, he also became the first rookie goaltender to both play and record a shutout in the Finals since Roy. He tied the rookie record for wins in the playoffs , previously held by Roy and Ron Hextall, and became the first rookie goalie to win the Conn Smythe Trophy since Hextall in 1987. After his heroics in the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Ward became the Hurricanes starting goaltender for the 2006\u201307 season. He recorded season stats of 30\u201321\u20136 and 37\u201325\u20135 in the 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 campaigns, respectively. The Hurricanes would miss the playoffs both years. The Hurricanes, however, would reach the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2008\u201309 season before bowing out to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins. Ward went 8\u201310 with a 2.67 GAA during the playoffs. Ward and the Hurricanes struggled to begin the 2009\u201310 season, as Ward went 2\u20139\u20133 to start the campaign. On November 8, 2009, in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, Ward was injured when he was cut on the leg by the skate of opposing forward Rick Nash. As Ward was helped into the dressing room, he left a trail of blood on the ice. After returning from his injury, Ward finished the season with an 18\u201323\u20135 record, a 2.69 GAA and .916 save percentage as the Hurricanes failed to qualify for the post-season. Ward was selected to participate in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game, along with teammates Eric Staal, Jamie McBain, and Jeff Skinner. Ward was the first overall pick in the 2011 NHL All-Star Game Fantasy Draft, selected by All-Star Game captain, Eric Staal. Ward was credited with an empty-net goal against the New Jersey Devils on December 26, 2011, when a misplaced pass from Ilya Kovalchuk found its way into the empty goal after a rebound from Ward. He is the tenth goalie in NHL history to do this. Ward recorded his 500th game with the Carolina Hurricanes on February 27, 2015. During the offseason, Ward re-signed with the Hurricanes to a two-year, $6.6 million contract on June 16, 2016. On March 22, 2018, during a game against the Arizona Coyotes, the puck got stuck in his skate without his knowledge. His skates crossed the goal line when he went back into the net, ultimately resulting in an own goal. Despite this, the Hurricanes ended up winning that game 6\u20135."

The name Bedworth Town was resurrected in 1905 when Bedworth Evening Combination School of the Coventry & North Warwickshire League changed their name. However, they folded in the early 1920s. The name was restored to use again in 1925 when Collycroft United League. After several seasons struggling in the league, finishing bottom in 1959\u201360 and then finishing in the bottom five every season between 1962\u201363 and 1967\u201368, the club folded in 1968. However, a replacement club was formed under the name Bedworth United, which took over from Town in the West Midlands League. In 1972 Bedworth moved up to Division One North of the Southern League, where they remained until league restructuring in 1979 saw them placed in the Midland Division. A sixth-place finish in 1981\u201382 was enough to earn a place in the new Premier Division in 1982. In 1988\u201389 they finished bottom of the division and were relegated to Division One Midlands, which became the Western Division in 1999. In 2006 they were transferred to Division One Midlands, which became Division One Central in 2010. A third-place finish in 2011\u201312 saw Bedworth qualify for the promotion play-offs. After beating Uxbridge 2\u20131 in the semi-final, they defeated Beaconsfield SYCOB 3\u20131 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. However, the following season saw them finish second-bottom of the table, resulting in relegation, this time to Division One South of the Northern Premier League. They were transferred back to Division One Central of the Southern League in 2014, and qualified for the play-offs again in 2014\u201315 after finishing fourth. A 2\u20131 win over Aylesbury in the semi-finals and then a 2\u20130 victory against Barton Rovers in the final saw them promoted back to the Southern League's Premier Division.

Then, on 7 November 2007, Quest issued the following statement about McKay: \"Further to the key findings from the final Quest report published on 15 June 2007 by the Premier League, Quest would like to emphasise that, in that report, it was clear that no evidence of irregular payments was found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved the agent Willie McKay.

Established on December 15, 2005, the club was founded after their former owners relocated the San Jose Earthquakes' players and staff to Houston following the 2005 season. For their first six seasons in Houston, the Dynamo were based at Robertson Stadium on the campus of the University of Houston. During the 2012 season, the club moved to PNC Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium in East Downtown Houston. The club is majority owned by Ted Segal, with Gabriel Brener, boxer Oscar De La Hoya via his sports promotion agency Golden Boy Promotions, Ben Guill, and basketball player James Harden all minority owners. The Houston Dynamo have been MLS Cup champions twice, winning during their first two seasons in 2006 and 2007. The club has also won the U.S. Open Cup once, in 2018. They have been MLS Cup runners-up twice, in 2011 and 2012, and Supporters' Shield runners-up once in 2008.

Garber was in Houston and spoke with the media before an international friendly between Mexico and Bulgaria at Reliant Stadium, citing Houston as a next destination for an MLS club whether the Earthquakes moved or not. On December 15, 2005, Major League Soccer announced the relocation of the San Jose franchise, along with all players and coaches under contract, to Houston. The Earthquakes name, colors and competition records were retained by the league for a possible expansion team. According to MLS, AEG had invested more than $20\u00a0million in the Earthquakes since purchasing the team in 2003 and suffered significant losses during that period because of its stadium deal. AEG had previously considered Houston as a site to relocate to and entered \"positive discussions\" about finding a soccer stadium in Houston. A ceremony was held outside Houston City Hall on December 16, 2005, to officially announce the franchise's arrival. Mayor Bill White joined city council members, Harris County officials, local soccer organizers and fans in welcoming team coach Dominic Kinnear and players Pat Onstad and Wade Barrett with cowboy boots and hats. It was disclosed that the team would train and play at the University of Houston's Robertson Stadium on a three-year lease with the university earning a percentage of the revenues from concessions, parking and other sources. In an immediate effort to plant roots in the community, AEG president and CEO Tim Leiweke announced former Houston Oilers quarterback Oliver Luck as the team's president and general manager. A previous NFL Europe executive, Luck had served as the head of the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority since 2001 and was instrumental in pursuing an MLS team for the city while also overseeing the construction of Minute Maid Park , Reliant Stadium and the Toyota Center during his tenure. Following an online fan vote, the team was originally named Houston 1836, after the year the city of Houston was founded. However, following some opposition to this name due to its association with the Texas Revolution, the name was eventually changed to Houston Dynamo."

The official reason for the name is that \"Dynamo is a word to describe someone who never fatigues, never gives up. The name is symbolic of Houston as an energetic, hard-working, risk-taking kind of town.\" The name \"Dynamo\" is also an homage to teams based out in the former Soviet Union republics and satellite states, such as Dynamo Moscow, Berliner FC Dynamo, Dynamo Dresden, FK Dinamo Tirana, Dynamo Kyiv, Dinamo Tbilisi, Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti  and Dinamo Zagreb. The team colors are orange, white, and \"Space City\" blue or \"Luv Ya Blue\" , meant as a symbol of the city of Houston flag which is light blue and of yet another team in Houston's sports history \u2013 the NFL's Houston Oilers. Originally, on January 25, 2006, the team had announced that Houston 1836 would be the team name. This followed an online survey for the fans to provide suggestions for the name. According to MLS & AEG, who chose the name, the 1836 name referred to the year that the city of Houston was founded by brothers Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen.  The name had perceived ambiguity, however, as it is also the year of Texan independence from Mexico. Houston 1836's logo featured a silhouette of General Sam Houston, one of Houston's and Texas' most famous historical figures. The choice of Houston 1836 soon became a political issue. It raised a furor among some locals of Hispanic descent, a major target audience, who related 1836 with the war for Texas independence. Owing to protests from Hispanic fans, the name was changed to the Dynamo. MLS has since not allowed any online surveys to name expansion teams."

        "content": "On December 2, 2010, Harris County and the Houston Sports Authority reached an agreement for the 20,000\u201322,000-seat soccer-specific stadium in Downtown Houston east of Minute Maid Park, across Highway 59 which would be the third sporting facility for Downtown Houston. The venue, then under the name of 'BBVA Compass Stadium' for sponsorship reasons, opened on May 12, 2012, with a game against D.C. United. On February 5, 2011, Houston Dynamo players, accompanied by Dynamo owner Philip Anschutz and Equity Partners Oscar De La Hoya and Gabriel Brener, Houston Mayor Annise Parker, Harris County Judge Ed Emmitt, Houston Dynamo President Chris Canetti, amongst others, participated in the groundbreaking of the Dynamo's new stadium in front of a few thousand fans. Construction began later that month. Spectators will be able to experience unobstructed views from both the lower and upper seating bowls, which are supported by a single concourse. The concourse provides full access around the stadium with easy access to concession and toilet facilities. The fan experience will be enhanced by modern sound and video elements throughout the stadium. Fully integrated broadcast facilities will allow viewers and listeners to feel part of the atmosphere. Aside from Major League Soccer and international soccer matches, the new Dynamo stadium also hosts Texas Southern University football, concerts, boxing matches, and much more. With its downtown location, the new stadium is now a part of a true Stadium District, which already features Minute Maid Park and Toyota Center, as well as other amenities and attractions such as the George R. Brown Convention Center, the Hilton Americas, Discovery Green, and Houston Pavilions. On June 13, 2019, it was announced that BBVA Compass Stadium was changing its name to BBVA Stadium. During the second half of the 2021 season, BBVA Stadium was rebranded as PNC Stadium following PNC Financial Services' acquisition of BBVA USA in June 2021."

Attendance gradually declined throughout the remainder of the spring and summer months. During July and August, they played five matches at Robertson Stadium, and the average attendance for those matches was 10,348. The team's attendance figures received a boost on August 9 when they played a game against Los Angeles Galaxy in Houston's Reliant Stadium as part of a double-header, with the other game being an exhibition match between FC Barcelona and Mexican side Club Am\u00e9rica, which attracted a crowd of 70,550. Home attendance began to rise again as the weather cooled and the playoffs approached. For the 2006 season, they averaged 18,935 over the 16 regular season home games. Attendance remained high during their playoff run, where home attendance was 17,440 and 23,107 in games against Chivas USA and Colorado Rapids. Dynamo FC fans contributed greatly to the sell-out crowd of 22,427 in the 2006 MLS Cup, which was played about 275 miles from Houston, in Frisco. There are currently three officially recognized supporter groups, El Batall\u00f3n. La Bateria and Brickwall Firm are former supporter groups."

On April 17, 2010, Navas Cobo became the first academy alum to appear in an MLS game for the Dynamo.  Alex Dixon became the first academy alum to score a goal with his stoppage time winner against Real Salt Lake on August 20, 2011. The Dynamo Academy has trained and played their games at Houston Sports Park since it opened in 2011.  Prior to that, they used multiple fields around the city. The Dynamo Academy is currently run by Academy Director Paul Holocher. For 2014 and 2015, USL-Pro team Charleston Battery was an affiliate with the Dynamo, letting Houston send players there on loan. In late 2014, the Dynamo met with USL officials about creating a USL team. Rio Grande Valley FC Toros replaced Charleston as the Dynamo's USL affiliate for the 2016 season. The Dynamo ran all soccer operations for the club, sending academy players as well as fringe first team players and players rehabbing from injury to train and play with the Toros throughout the year.  In December 2020, RGVFC and the Dynamo restructured the relationship, giving the Toros control over all aspects of their soccer operations. Following the 2021 season, the agreement ended, allowing Rio Grande Valley FC to become an independent club. Brazos Valley Cavalry has served as the Dynamo's USL League Two affiliate since 2017. On December 6, 2021, it was announced that the Dynamo would field a team, Houston Dynamo 2, in the inaugural season of MLS Next Pro in 2022.  The team plays their games at Aveva Stadium, part of Houston Sports Park. The Dynamo also own the Houston Dash of the NWSL."

In December 2005, it underwent a minor reconstruction and added some 525 additional seats to reach the current capacity of 5,000.

        "title": "Steal (basketball)_Summary",
        "content": "In basketball, a steal occurs when a defensive player legally causes a turnover by their positive, aggressive action. This can be done by deflecting and controlling, or by catching the opponent's pass or dribble of an offensive player.  The defender must not touch the offensive player's hands or otherwise a foul is called. Steals are credited to the defensive player who first causes the turnover, even if they do not end up with possession of the live ball. To earn a steal, the defensive player must be the initiator of the action causing the turnover, not just the benefactor.  Whenever a steal is recorded by a defensive player, an offensive player must be credited as committing a turnover. Stealing the ball requires good anticipation, speed and fast reflexes, all common traits of  good defenders. However, like blocked shots, steals are not always a perfect gauge of a player's defensive abilities. An unsuccessful steal can result in the defender being out of position and unable to recover in time, allowing the offense to score. Therefore, attempting to steal is a gamble. Steals, though risky, can pay off greatly, because they often trigger a fast break for the defensive team. There is no prototypical position from which a player may get many steals. While smaller, quicker guards tend to accumulate the most steals, there are many exceptions. For example, forward Rick Barry led the NBA in steals in 1974\u201375, and for many years center Hakeem Olajuwon led his team in the category, consistently ranking among the league's leaders, and is the only center ranked in the top 10 all-time in steals. Karl Malone, a power forward, is currently number eleven."

The NBA leader in steals per game is Robertson with an average of 2.71 and 3.67 . Baron Davis is the all-time playoff leader in steals per game for a career with 2.28 SPG.

        "content": "A sprawl is a martial arts and wrestling term for a defensive technique that is done in response to certain takedown attempts, typically double or single leg takedown attempts. The sprawl is performed by scooting the legs backwards, so as to land on the upper back of the opponent attempting the takedown. The resultant position is also known as a sprawl or sprawling position. Ideally, the sprawling combatant should create safe hip extension as much as possible and keep his knees off the floor. His options from the sprawl include attempting to gain leverage on the lower back by hooking underneath the elbows, throwing in a headlock, and grabbing his opponent's ankles and trying to get behind his opponent. Keeping the knees off the ground creates more weight pushing down on the opponent. In mixed martial arts, sprawling is an important aspect of the sprawl-and-brawl strategy, while it is also used by numerous other wrestlers and mixed martial arts stylists. The sprawl is also used in some forms of exercise, and commonly confused with the burpee. The sprawl is generally seen as a bad exercise for the lower-back, this is however not true as the sprawl, when performed correctly by athletes that are conditioned and flexible, is just as safe as the burpee. The important thing is to create hip extension rather than arching the back. Proper hip extension is created by squeezing the glutes, this in turn pulls the pelvis back upon which the spine safely follows."

        "content": "Samuel John Everett Loxton  was an Australian cricketer, footballer and politician. Among these three pursuits, his greatest achievements were attained on the cricket field; he played in 12 Tests for Australia from 1948 to 1951. A right-handed all-rounder, Loxton was part of Don Bradman's Invincibles, who went through the 1948 tour of England undefeated, an unprecedented achievement that has never been matched. As well as being a hard-hitting middle-order batsman, Loxton was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler who liked to aim at the upper bodies of the opposition, and an outfielder with an accurate and powerful throw. After being dropped from the national team, Loxton represented Victoria for seven more seasons before retiring from first-class cricket. He served as an administrator after his playing days were over and spent 24 years as a Liberal Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. Up until 1946, Loxton also played in the Victorian Football League for St Kilda as a forward. In all three arenas, he was known for his energetic approach. Educated at Wesley College, Melbourne, Loxton first gained prominence as an Australian rules football player. After debuting in 1942, he played 41 games in the VFL for St Kilda as a forward, kicking a total of 114 goals before retiring at the end of the 1946 season to concentrate on his cricket career. In 1944, he headed St Kilda's goal-kicking aggregate with 52 goals and placed second in the club's Best and Fairest. Loxton served in a tank division during World War II and made his first-class cricket debut in 1946\u201347. He scored 232 not out, which remains a record for any Australian player on his first-class debut. After a strong first season, Loxton was selected to make his Test debut in the final match of the 1947\u201348 home series against India. Australia had already won the series and used the last match to trial their young talent. Loxton seized his opportunity, scoring 80 and taking three wickets, securing himself a position on the 1948 England tour. After a slow start to the historic campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced his way into the team for the last three Tests. He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949\u201350, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950\u201351 home season; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring at the end of the 1957\u201358 season. A member of the Liberal Party, Loxton entered politics and was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, representing the electoral district of Prahran from 1955 to 1979. During this time, Loxton was also active in cricket administration at club, state and international level. He was a state selector for over two decades, and served at national level for ten years, starting in 1970\u201371. He was also the team manager for Australia's tour of the subcontinent in 1959\u201360, overseeing a successful campaign despite a spate of serious illnesses to personnel. Loxton had to deal with a variety of tumultuous events on and off the field during his tenure, often relating to player misconduct, and retired from cricket administration in 1981 following the underarm incident."

        "content": "Loxton was born on 29 March 1921 at Albert Park, Victoria, the son of Sam Sr. and Annie. The elder Sam Loxton was an electrician who played second grade cricket for Collingwood. The younger Sam started his education at Yarra Park State School, where he learned to bat, using a pine tree in the schoolyard as the stumps; the same tree was used for the same purpose years earlier by Test players Vernon Ransford and Ernie McCormick, and long-serving Victorian batsman Jack Ledward. The family moved to Armadale, and young Loxton attended Armadale Public School before completing his secondary education at Wesley College, Melbourne, an elite private boys\u2019 school. One of his colleagues at Wesley College was Ian Johnson, a future teammate for Victoria and Australia. The boys\u2019 school coach was P. L. Williams, a renowned mentor of teenagers who had earlier coached Ross Gregory and future Test captain Lindsay Hassett. Away from his sporting commitments at school, Loxton played district cricket for Prahran's third grade team when he was just 12. The young cricketer's parents were stalwarts of the club; Sam Sr. was the scorer and served as a transport man, driving the matting and equipment to matches, while Annie made cucumber sandwiches for 25 years\u2014due to the economic difficulties caused by the Great Depression and World War II, meat catering for players was a luxury even at first-class and international matches. The elder Sam was a member of the club committee from 1941 until his death in 1974, and was a vice-president for the last 17 years of his life. At the age of 16, the younger Loxton was selected in the Victorian Cricket Association Colts team that played in the first grade competition in 1937\u201338; he played three seasons with the outfit, which was effectively a state youth team. The squad was coached by Bert Cohen and former Test batsman and captain Jack Ryder, and Loxton credited the latter as the biggest influence on his career, saying Loxton improved significantly in his third season with the Colts, scoring his first century and taking 21 wickets, having managed only seven scalps in the two previous summers. In 1940\u201341, aged 19, he moved back to Prahran to play in their first grade team after the Colts were disbanded, and he became more productive over the next few years, taking 46 wickets in one season. Loxton also played Australian rules football, and in 1942, he made his debut in the Victorian Football League \u2014the highest tier of competition at the time\u2014playing for St Kilda. One of his teammates was Keith Miller, a future Invincibles colleague. Loxton played as both a forward and a defender, and the pair sometimes played together in attack. The recruit from Prahran played in only six matches in his first year, kicking 15 goals. Debuting in round six, he started his career brightly, kicking five and four goals in his first two matches against Melbourne and Collingwood respectively, helping his team to two victories. However, the goals and victories began to dry up and Loxton managed only six goals and one win in the remaining four matches. St Kilda came second to last and did not make the finals. During World War II, Loxton served with the 2nd Armoured Division. He enlisted on 31 July 1942 at Oakleigh, Victoria and was discharged on 7November 1945 with the rank of sergeant, having spent most of his time at the division headquarters. The war ended Loxton and Miller's partnership at St Kilda. Miller was deployed to South Australia for training before becoming a fighter pilot in England, while his St Kilda colleague served in a reserve unit in Melbourne, enabling him to continue his football career when granted leave. In 1943, Loxton played in only the last four matches of the season, all of which were lost, kicking seven goals, and St Kilda finished last with a solitary victory from ten games. He managed three goals each against Essendon and South Melbourne but was held goal-less against Melbourne. The following year, Loxton played in all 18 matches and topped St Kilda's goal-kicking aggregates with 52. After making a slow start to the season, aggregating only four goals in the first four matches, including two goal-less outings, he began to score more heavily. The St Kilda forward registered a six-goal haul against Geelong in round eight, helping to secure an away win, and scored 23 goals in the last six matches, including five in each of the last three matches. However, St Kilda won only one of these three matches. Loxton's efforts helped his club to finish ninth out of 12 teams, and he came second in the club Best and Fairest. He played a solitary match in 1945, which St Kilda lost, and went goal-less."

        "content": "An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler, Loxton spent much of his cricket career in the shadow of Miller, who played the same type of role. Upon Miller's death in 2004, he said \"I was in Keith's shadow all my career... and it was a pretty big shadow.\" First-class cricket resumed in 1945\u201346 after the end of the war, but Loxton failed to gain state selection during the season. He played his final VFL season in 1946 and was chosen in 12 of St Kilda's 19 games, kicking 40 goals. However, his team won only two of these 12 matches, and finished second last. Loxton had a strong start to his final season, kicking 34 goals in the first 8rounds. This included a career best of eight goals in another away win over Geelong. He also added six goals apiece against Footscray and Collingwood, but it was not enough to prevent defeats. However, Loxton missed three matches after the eighth round and upon his return, struggled and managed only six goals in his last four matches for St Kilda. Having retired from top-tier football, Loxton soon broke into first-class cricket. He was selected for Victoria to make his debut in the match against Queensland in December 1946 because five players, including Miller, were playing in a Test match for Australia against England during their Test tour. The debutant scored 232 not out, sharing a Victorian record sixth-wicket partnership of 289 with Doug Ring, who made 145. When he had scored 183, Loxton hit himself on the head with his bat in attempting a hook shot, but continued batting until the end of Victoria's innings and then opened the bowling in Queensland's innings. He took the first wicket before going off to hospital with concussion. Recovering in time to bowl in the second innings, he took 2wickets for 40 runs in an innings win. Loxton's 232 not out remains a record debut score in Australian first-class cricket. His debut performance was enough for him to keep his place when the Test players returned, and he scored 73 and took a total of 3/17 in the next match against arch-rivals New South Wales, which Victoria won by an innings. He compiled 87 in the next match against Queensland, and Victoria won all but one of the five Sheffield Shield matches in which he played\u2014the only draw was washed out\u2014to claim the title. The all-rounder finished the season atop Victoria's batting averages, with 429 runs at a batting average of 143.00. He also headed the bowling averages with 8wickets at 14.00 runs apiece. The following season, Loxton's record was less spectacular despite playing in all but one of Victoria's matches. He hit 77 and 35 not out in the opening match of the summer against the Indian tourists, and was rewarded with selection in an Australian XI to play the visitors ahead of the Tests. In what was effectively a Test trial, the uncapped all-rounder failed to impress with the bat, making a duck and six. He bowled extensively, sending down 47 overs and taking a total of 4/113 as the Australians fell to a defeat. Loxton was passed over for Test selection and returned to domestic competition, scoring 53 and taking a total of 4/56 in the next match against New South Wales, which the Victorians won by nine wickets. He then went into an unproductive sequence, failing to pass 31 and taking only three wickets in his next four matches over a two-month period. His seven wickets in the Sheffield Shield games cost almost 49 runs each. Despite this, the Australian captain Don Bradman had been impressed by what he saw of Loxton at domestic level, and the Victorian all-rounder was chosen for the Fifth and final Test against India. With the series already convincingly won 3\u20130, Australia decided to rest several players in order to trial up and coming cricketers ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Len Johnson, Loxton and fellow Victorian Ring were thus given their Test debuts. Australia batted first and Loxton came in to bat in front of a supportive home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He made 80, putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey, who made his first Test century in his second international match, as Australia amassed 8/575. The debutant all-rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey \"was going along merrily and he soon settled me down\". Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings. Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent, Brown threw the ball to his debutants. Johnson was given the ball first change, but failed to make an impact, so Loxton was handed his chance. He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2/61 in the first innings, removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad. In the words of Brown, the Victorian all-rounder \"looked twice the bowler Johnson did\". The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings. The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948. He reflected that \"It's not the fellow who gets the opportunity it's the fellow who puts his hands around it and grabs it. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.\" After his position in the touring party was confirmed, he continued his late-season resurgence, scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England."

        "content": "Loxton started his English campaign slowly. Australia typically selected their strongest team for the tour opener against Worcestershire, and the all-rounder was omitted as the visitors won by an innings. As the Australians often played six days a week, they employed a rotation policy in the county matches, and in the second game against Leicestershire, Loxton made his debut on English soil. He made only four, before opening the bowling in both innings and taking a total of 1/23 in an innings victory. His attempts to break into the first-choice team were hampered by a groin strain he suffered in the third match against Yorkshire when he was striving for extra pace in his only over in the first innings. As a result, he played no further part in the match. One man down, Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31 in pursuit of 60\u2014effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat\u2014before scraping home without further loss after Yorkshire dropped both batsmen. The injured all-rounder missed two matches to recuperate before reappearing in mid-May, hitting 120 as the Australians posted a total of 721 against Essex in a single day at Southend, still the highest single day's total in first-class cricket. He put on 166 in 65 minutes with Ron Saggers, who, with Bill Brown and Donald Bradman, also scored centuries. Loxton's rapid innings was noted for its hooking and driving and took around 80 minutes. He followed up with an unbeaten 79 and two wickets in the match against Oxford University, but that failed to win him a place in the first set-piece battle of the summer, against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full-strength Test outfit, while Australia fielded their strongest XI, so the fixture was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Bradman opted to play Brown out of the position in the middle-order, and Loxton missed out; Australia went on to win by an innings. Loxton then played in each of Australia's four remaining tour games before the Tests, but was unable to do enough to force his way into the first-choice team. He made 39 and 52 against Lancashire, and 16 against Nottinghamshire, squandering his starts in the latter two innings to run outs. In the match against Hampshire, he made one in his only innings after Australia were caught on a damp pitch and took a solitary wicket. The Australian team's batting depth did not help Loxton's cause; in the final pre-Test match against Sussex, a match won by an innings and 325 runs, he was slated to bat at No. 9, but Australia's earlier batsmen were largely untroubled so Bradman declared at 5/549. The all-rounder's 3/13 in the first innings had the effect of removing him from the bowling line-up for the rest of the match, as Doug Ring, Ernie Toshack, Ron Hamence and Ian Johnson helped Ray Lindwall to bowl the touring team to an easy victory. Loxton had limited opportunities as those ahead of him tended to finish off the opposition before his turn, and did not score heavily enough when he had a chance, so he was overlooked for the First Test at Trent Bridge. Bradman again opted to use Brown out of position in the middle-order as Australia took an eight-wicket win. There were only two matches between the First and Second Tests. Loxton took a total of 2/29 and scored only 17 against Northamptonshire, and was rested against Yorkshire. Brown made a century in the latter match, and Australia fielded an unchanged team for the Second Test at Lord's and completed another victory. As the tour reached its halfway point, the Victorian began to make an impression. In the next county game, his opening partnership with Neil Harvey scored the 122 runs needed to beat Surrey in only 58 minutes, Loxton making 47. He also took a total 3/90 for the match, bowling 43 overs as Bradman allowed his main bowlers to recuperate after the previous Test. In the following match against Gloucestershire he contributed an unbeaten 159 including four sixes, as Australia made their highest score for the summer, 7/774 declared. The all-rounder's innings involved a series of powerful strokes and he was particularly noted for using his feet to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard. The Gloucestershire bowler had been touted as a possible Test selection, because the other England bowlers had failed to contain Australia's batsman in the first two matches, but his chances of selection were ended by the tourists\u2019 assault at Bristol. These performances won Loxton selection for the Third Test, played at Old Trafford, where he replaced Brown, who had struggled in the middle-order, averaging less than 25 in the unfamiliar environment. The match was the most evenly contested Test of the series, with England in control before four sessions were lost to rain on the last two days, resulting in a draw. Loxton bowled 15 overs in all without success, and made 36 runs batting at No.7 in the first innings, helping Australia to avoid the follow on. In the first innings, he ran out Alec Bedser, ending a 121-run partnership between Bedser and Denis Compton. The Victorian all-rounder then top-scored with 123 and took a total of 4/48 in a nine-wicket win in the intervening county match against Middlesex at Lord's, and he retained his place in the side for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Loxton was not involved in the second inning effort in which the Australians scored 3/404 on the final day, a world record for a successful Test run-chase, but he had taken three of the last four wickets in England's first innings of 496 and scored a hard-hitting 93 in the first innings, putting on 105 in 95 minutes with Harvey. Their counterattacking partnership helped Australia to halt the English momentum after an early collapse; the score was still 4/189 when Loxton came in to bat. He was particularly severe on Jim Laker, lifting his off breaks into the crowd for four of his five sixes, mostly from lofted drives. With a maiden Test century beckoning, the Victorian swung wildly at a Norman Yardley ball and was bowled. In the dressing room, Sir Robert Menzies, a Prime Minister of Australia well known as a cricket-lover, upbraided him, saying \"That was a pretty stupid thing to do. You could have made a century\", to which the fallen batsman retorted, \"Haven\u2019t you made a few mistakes in your time, too?\" Nevertheless, Australia eventually proceeded from 6/329 at the time of Loxton's departure to end on 458, almost nullifying the effect of England's strong first innings total. Immediately after the Fourth Test, Loxton scored 51 and took a total of 4/43 in an innings victory over Derbyshire, but was less productive in his remaining three matches before the Fifth Test, totaling only four wickets and 17 runs in three completed innings. He retained his position for the final Test of the series, but had little to do in an innings victory. He was required to bowl only two overs in the first innings as the frontline pacemen cut down the hosts for only 52, and then scored 15 in Australia's reply of 389. In the second innings he bowled ten overs without taking a wicket. The Victorian all-rounder was not prominent in his four matches after the Tests, totaling only 112 runs and five wickets. His most successful returns were four wickets for the match in an innings victory over Kent, and a quickfire 67 not out in 75 minutes against the South of England. In the final match of the England leg of the tour\u2014there were two matches in Scotland afterwards\u2014he hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his face, breaking his nose, thus forcing him to miss the final two matches in Scotland. On the tour as a whole, Loxton scored 973 runs at an average of 57.23 and took 32 wickets at 21.71. Such was the strength of the team he was only fifth in the batting averages and eighth among the bowlers. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack summed up his contribution thus:"

        "content": "There were no Tests during the 1948\u201349 season in Australia, with only domestic matches scheduled. Loxton played regularly for Victoria, scoring 500 runs in the Sheffield Shield, compiling 135 against South Australia and 84 against Queensland. He scored 60 and took a total of 5/77 in one match against New South Wales, but Victoria was unable to win either match against their arch-rivals, who took the title. Two big set-piece matches, a testimonial match for Bradman and a joint benefit for Alan Kippax and Bert Oldfield, were used by the selectors as a trial for the 1949\u201350 South African tour. Loxton played in both testimonial matches; he failed to pass 21 in the first match but took a total of 4/100. In the latter match he scored 93. The Victorian all-rounder ended the season with 634 runs at 42.26 and 16 wickets at 24.31 and was selected for the South African tour under the leadership of the newly appointed captain Lindsay Hassett. Like the Invincibles tour, the 1949\u201350 Test series in South Africa was another triumph for the Australians. They won four of the five Tests and were undefeated in 21 first-class matches. Loxton started the tour strongly, making 117 in the opening match against Zululand, which was not first-class. He continued his productivity in the succeeding games, never failing to pass 40 in any completed innings in the first five first-class matches of the tour. This included an all-round effort of 76 not out and a total of 4/10 in an innings victory over Orange Free State. However, the Victorian's form slumped just before the Tests. He made single figure scores in his last three innings, including in the last match against a South African XI in what was effectively a dry run for the Tests. However, he did take 4/32 for the match. Loxton played in all five Tests, and in the First Test at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, he scored his first Test century. He compiled 101 in 150 minutes, helping Australia to a total of 413 after both opening batsmen were out without scoring. Hassett's men went on to win the match by an innings. The Second Test was an eight-wicket victory for the Australians, this time dominated by Harvey's 178, with whom Loxton shared a 140-run stand for the fifth wicket, contributing 35 himself. He also took a wicket. The Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban was dramatic; batting first, South Africa made 311 and Hugh Tayfield then took 7/23 as Australia collapsed to 75 all out after the rain and sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket. During the first innings, Hassett changed his batting order so that his better batsmen were low down in the order so that they could bat in better conditions as the pitch stabilised. Loxton batted at No. 10 and Harvey at No. 9, but the Australians collapsed before the pitch had changed measurably. Not enforcing the follow-on, the South Africans batted again and were themselves bowled out for 99, losing their last seven wickets for 14 runs. This left Australia to chase 336 runs for victory, highly unlikely as the last 28 wickets had fallen for only 245. The tourists were still more than 200 runs in arrears when Loxton came in to join Harvey. On Loxton's first ball, a delivery from Tayfield narrowly missed his edge. He survived to lunch after being caught from a no-ball on the long on boundary from a lofted drive. With an unbeaten 151, Harvey took Australia to an improbable five-wicket victory, supported by his fellow Victorian, who scored 54 in a century partnership. The Fourth Test of the series was a high-scoring draw, Loxton making six in his only innings. His 43 in the final Test of the series was overshadowed by centuries for three of his teammates, in an innings win that sealed the series 4\u20130. In the Test series as a whole, the Victorian all-rounder made 255 runs at an average of 42.50, but bowled only 34 overs in taking two wickets. He made little impact on the tour matches after the start of the Tests, passing fifty twice and taking two wickets from 13 overs in five matches. For the entire tour, Loxton totaled 809 first-class runs at 40.45 and took 12 wickets."

        "content": "Loxton had an unproductive time during the 1950\u201351 Australian season. He lost his Test place after three matches, and in Sheffield Shield games his highest score for the season was just 62. In the first match of the season, he made four for Victoria against Freddie Brown's touring team, a portent of the coming season. However, he did bounce back in the final match before the Tests, scoring 62 and 37 and taking 3/24 against New South Wales. The First Test of the Ashes series at Brisbane was decided largely by a tropical storm that completely changed the nature of the pitch after the first day. The Australian all-rounder had by then been the victim of a spectacular catch by England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans, making 24 in Australia's 228. He picked up five catches\u2014his first Test catches in his tenth match\u2014as the Australians surrounded the English batsmen, who made 7/68 on the sticky wicket before Brown declared to force the Australian batsmen to suffer on the treacherous surface. Loxton was out for a duck in the second innings, unable to cope with the conditions, as did most of his compatriots. Australia collapsed to 3/0 before reaching 7/32, at which point Hassett declared after 78 minutes of batting. England fell to 6/30 at stumps in pursuit of 193. Twenty wickets had fallen in four hours, while only 102 runs had been scored. Australia eventually won the match by 71 runs. In the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, his last at his home ground, Loxton's 32 formed part of a stand of 84 with Hassett, the highest partnership in a closely fought, low-scoring game in which no team passed 200. He again failed in the second innings, scoring two as Australia scraped home by 28 runs. After contributing 17 in a total of 426 in the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, which Australia won by an innings to take an unassailable 3\u20130 series lead, he was dropped in favour of Jim Burke, who scored a century on debut. The Victorian never played Test cricket again. Loxton returned to play for Victoria, and although he struggled for runs, managing only three fifties for the season, wickets came regularly. He took match totals of 4/55 and 3/24 against Queensland, 4/55 against South Australia and 2/23 against Western Australia; Victoria won all four matches, and claimed the Sheffield Shield. Playing in seven of the eight matches, he scored 309 runs at 30.90 and taking 16 wickets at 12.56."

        "content": "Although his Test career had finished, Loxton continued to play for his state. He had another disappointing season with the bat in 1951\u201352, scoring only 322 runs at 24.76 in nine matches. After winning the opening match of the season against Western Australia, he did not taste victory again until the final fixture of the summer against South Australia, in which he scored 71\u2014his only fifty of the season\u2014and took a total of 4/37 in an innings victory. Victoria lost three times and would have suffered a fourth defeat but for Loxton's unbeaten 41 against Queensland, which helped them to hold on for a draw with one wicket intact. He continued to take regular wickets, ending with 21 scalps at 31.00 for the season, including an innings best of 4/56, but he managed a total of only 4/249 against New South Wales, who went on to win the competition. Loxton had a more productive campaign during the 1952\u201353 season, scoring 470 runs at 33.57 and taking 23 wickets at 26.26 in nine matches. He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, but it was not enough to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this was not enough for him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match. In 1953\u201354, Loxton was part of a Commonwealth team that toured India during the Australian season, playing in 15 first-class matches. He played in all five of the matches that were termed as \"unofficial Tests\" on this tour. The Victorian's first month on tour was keynoted by his bowling. He took 12 wickets at 19.75 but scored only 115 runs at 23.00 without passing 25 in the first four matches. Loxton had no success in the first representative match, scoring 2and 6and taking 0/72 in an innings defeat. However, his fortunes turned in the next match against Bombay, when he took 5/92, the first five-wicket innings haul in his first-class career. He also scored 123, but was unable to force a victory. He carried the form into the next representative match, scoring 55 and taking a total of 3/99 in a drawn encounter. The Victorian continued his all-round form against Bengal, scoring 100 and taking 5/87 in an innings victory. His form tapered away thereafter and he failed to pass 40 and took a total of only four wickets in the three remaining representative matches. The Commonwealth outfit won the third match but lost the fourth, ceding the series 2\u20131. Loxton ended the tour with 647 runs at 35.94 and 33 wickets at 31.90, but struggled in the matches against India, scoring 148 runs at 21.14 and taking 7wickets at 56.14. After returning to Australia, Loxton had a torrid time with the bat in the 1954\u201355 season, scoring only 126 runs at 14.00 and failing to pass 30 in his six matches. He took 12 wickets at 32.41 for the season, the fewest wickets in any of his first-class seasons. The all-rounder's best effort was a 4/31 against New South Wales in a match that Victoria lost by nine wickets. Loxton had a more productive summer in 1955\u201356. In seven matches, he scored 286 runs at 40.85 including an unbeaten century against South Australia, and took 14 wickets at 20.07; his best was a 4/35 in the return match against South Australia. The Sheffield Shield was won by Victoria's bitter rivals New South Wales in both seasons. In 1956\u201357, his penultimate season for Victoria, Loxton\u2014aged nearly 36\u2014scored 134 and took 2/30 to orchestrate an innings victory over South Australia in the second match of the summer. In the penultimate match of the season, which effectively determined the fate of the Sheffield Shield, the Victorian all-rounder took 4/44 to help dismiss New South Wales for 149 and take a 292-run first innings lead. However, the defending champions hung on for a draw to ensure the retention of their title. Loxton then surpassed his previous career best by taking 6/49 against Western Australia to set up a nine-wicket win in the last match of the season. Loxton retired after playing in the 1957\u201358 season. With the Test players in South Africa, he made 331 runs at 41.37 including 2centuries, and took 9wickets at 26.33 in 8matches. He made 107 in an innings triumph over Queensland and 106 in a drawn match against South Australia. It was not enough for him to win a third Sheffield Shield title; New South Wales won for the fifth successive time, defeating Victoria in both their matches. Loxton made little impact in his final match; although the Victorians defeated Queensland, his only participation was to score five runs in the first innings. His highest score remained the 232 not out he had made on his first-class debut. Loxton continued to play for Prahran until 1962\u201363, and he topped the batting and bowling averages for the club on five and six occasions respectively. He topped both the batting and bowling averages in the same season on four occasions. The all-rounder scored a total of 6,032 runs and took 351 wickets during his first grade career, and was named the captain of the club's honorary Team of the Century."

        "content": "An aggressive right-handed all-rounder, Loxton tended to bat in the middle-order, and bowled after the new ball pacemen. As well as being a belligerent batsman, he was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler known for his ability to move the ball, and a powerful outfielder. He had a strong arm and exploited his power frequently, to the extent that the Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon complained about the jarring impact of his unnecessarily strong throws when the batsmen were already home and no run out was possible. Loxton was known for his energetic and aggressive approach to cricket, and liked to attack and intimidate opposition batsmen. In one match in the late-1950s, he bowled an eight-ball over at New South Welshman Norm O'Neill consisting entirely of bouncers aimed at the upper body. Loxton was not afraid of opposition bowlers doing the same to him; he had a penchant for trying to hook bouncers out of the ground. He was a predominantly back-foot player whose initial foot-movement tended to be back and towards and then across the stumps. When he committed to a back foot shot, Loxton often made such a decisive retreat that he almost stepped onto his stumps. One painter once captured the Victorian almost disturbing the woodwork with his right leg, leading Loxton to quip \"That's what I call using the crease\". Hassett said that his fellow Victorian \"really used to give everything he had all the time... Put him on to bowl and he'd bowl his hardest, no matter how he felt.\" Bradman said that Loxton \"never shirked the issue\" and that \"he\u2019d throw himself into it with everything he had. This is one of the reasons he was a great team man. You could call on him at any stage and he\u2019d give you his very best.\" Bradman said that the Victorian all-rounder \"was never a great cricketer in the sense that some others were great, but he was a very good player and what he lacked in ability he made up for in effort\". He further added that the Victorian was \"the very essence of belligerence...His whole attitude suggests defiance and when he hits the ball it is the music of a sledgehammer.\" Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic, regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level, and thought that the Victorian all-rounder's career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting. As a footballer, Loxton usually played as a forward, but was also used as a full-back and alternated between the two positions. He was known for his physical strength; another VFL player who had a reputation as an \"enforcer\" tried to bump him and later said that the collision made him feel as though he had run into a goalpost. According to Robert Coleman, Loxton was \"competitive, pugnacious and outspoken, with a doglike loyalty to everyone and everything he served, whether it was his captain, his team, his party, his premier or his constituents.\""

        "content": "Loxton was the manager of the 1959\u201360 Australian team that toured Pakistan and India. By this time, only two colleagues from the 1948 Invincibles tour\u2014Harvey and Ray Lindwall\u2014remained. The Victorian was the first manager since World War II to not also be a member of the Australian Board of Control. It was widely believed that the high-ranking administrators saw the Indian subcontinent as an unenviable appointment; on past tours, many players had fallen seriously ill, suffered food poisoning, and found the oppressive heat and third world living conditions hard to bear. Some players were reluctant to tour and wanted to opt out. Loxton felt that his experience with the Commonwealth XI six years earlier was a factor in his selection and suspected that he was the only applicant, quipping \"what board member would be silly enough to go there?\" Loxton was known for his blunt nature, and his appointment to a post that required him to liaise with cricket officials from opposing nations raised eyebrows. The cricket historian Gideon Haigh wrote \"Thoughts of such a gruff, soldierly man acting the diplomat had caused great ribaldry\". In a speech at a cricket dinner, his former captain Hassett joked \"I would advise Mr [Prime Minister] Menzies to have army and navy standing by. A week after Sam gets to India, war is bound to break out.\" On the field, the Australians\u2014captained by Richie Benaud\u2014were successful. They defeated Pakistan 2\u20130 in three Tests, and India 2\u20131 over five matches. Australia's only other Test win on Pakistani soil came in 1998 and they have won only two series in India since the Benaud-Loxton expedition. They also remained unbeaten outside the Test matches. Despite the success with bat and ball, the Australians were struck down by serious illness during the second part of their tour in India, despite taking Dr. Ian McDonald\u2014a former Victorian first-class cricketer\u2014with the travelling party. Gordon Rorke, Lindsay Kline and Gavin Stevens all contracted hepatitis; the former two were sent home, while the latter was too ill to fly back to Australia until the end of the tour. Harvey said that Stevens\u2014who never played first-class cricket again after his illness\u2014\"could've been the first man to die on tour\". Due to the bevy of unfit players, Loxton was forced to line up in one game, against Indian Universities in Bangalore, two years after playing his last first-class match. He scored 33 and bowled six overs without taking a wicket in a high-scoring draw. There were several administrative difficulties during the tour. Bill Dowling\u2014the chairman of the Australian Board of Control\u2014had informed Loxton that no Test match was to begin until a receipt for 6,500 pounds had been handed over to Australian authorities. The Australian manager had also been told to rebuff any Pakistani overtures for a reciprocal tour, as it was feared that they lacked public appeal and would have caused financial losses due to a fall in ticket sales. Despite previous assurances to prepare turf pitches, the locals made a matting surface for the First Test. During the Second Test, when asked by General Ayub Khan\u2014head of the ruling military junta\u2014why Pakistan had not been invited to Australia, Loxton exploited the opportunity to complain about the wickets. When the tourists were greeted by another matting track in the Third Test, Ayub threatened to shoot the groundsmen if they prepared any more non-turf surfaces. The financial issue reared its head before the Second Test against India in Kanpur, when Loxton belligerently refused to start the match after the payment had failed to arrive on time. An Indian official asked the Australian manager to not \"spoil a beautiful friendship over money\", to which the Australian manager replied \"Try me. I want it please...You know the rules.\" The match proceeded after the cheque was delivered, and India inflicted Australia's only defeat for the tour and their first Test win over the visitors. Another mishap occurred during the Fifth Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta; the Australians left their hotel and took to the field with ten men, having failed to notice that Ian Meckiff had overslept and been left behind by the team bus. During the First Test against Pakistan in Dacca, one of the umpires took off his shoes and put them on the ground while play was in progress. Loxton took a photo of the scene and lodged it to cricket authorities, asking them to make a ruling on whether a batsman would be out if the ball struck the umpire's loose shoes and bounced up into a fielder's hands. However, he never received a reply."

        "title": "Sam Loxton_Political career",
        "content": "Loxton joined the Armadale branch of the Liberal Party in 1950. Henry Bolte, the Liberal leader in Victoria, was the state opposition leader at the time, and encouraged him to enter politics. The cricketer's entry into electoral politics came after he was involved in a debate at a cricket club meeting. A person at the gathering reported his argumentative performance to senior Liberal Party figures, and soon after, Bolte began actively courting the cricketer. On 28 September 1954, Loxton won pre-selection and was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the electorate of Prahran. At the time, the seat was comfortably held by the ruling Labor Party , who had captured 61.59% of the vote at the previous election. The Liberals were not optimistic about their chances, and Bolte told his candidate \"You won't win [the seat], but we'd like you to fly the flag\". The cricketer refused to think that his candidacy was simply there to make up the numbers, and he told Bolte as much. The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954\u201355 grade cricket finals. Loxton took 7wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title for the first time in 32 years, and was hailed as a local hero. It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets. In a close-run contest, the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count. He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party , which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s, claiming that it was too soft towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time. Loxton polled 35.70% of the first preferences, well behind Pettiona's 47.25%, but received almost all of the DLP's 13.66% of the vote as preferences to end with 50.04%. The result helped bring Bolte's Liberals to power, and they stayed in office until 1982, by which time Loxton had retired. Loxton entered the Victorian parliament in 1955, and served as government whip from 1961 until his retirement in 1979. At the time of his election, he was the youngest member of parliament, and was given the honour of making the Address-in-Reply, the first speech after opening of the new sitting by the governor, using it to advocate increased lending from the government-owned banks to promote higher levels of home ownership. At the 1958 election, Loxton consolidated his hold on the seat, leading on first preferences , and ending with 54.85% of the two party preferred vote to halt Pettiona's attempted comeback. During the election campaign in 1961, a campaign meeting in Prahran that was attended by Premier Bolte and Loxton drew several hundred people and descended into chaos; heckling and some scuffles broke out. At this election, the Liberals' primary vote fell to 41.69% behind the Labor Party's candidate George Gahan 45.29%, and he had to rely on DLP preferences to retain the seat with a reduced two party preferred vote of 52.71%. The Liberals may have been hindered by a how-to-vote card circulated on election day by a third party that had a pro-Liberal headline, but instructed the reader to mark the ALP candidate as their first preference. Loxton managed to secure a court injunction\u2014believed to be the first of its kind in Victoria\u2014prohibiting further distribution of the material, but not before hundreds of misleading instructions had been disseminated. In 1964, Loxton increased his primary vote to 45.77% and defeated Pettiona for the third time, ending with a fairly safe 57.72% after the distribution of preferences. In 1967, the retired cricketer repelled a political challenge by Jack Dyer, an iconic former footballer of the Richmond Tigers famed as one of the toughest players in history, and retained his seat at further elections in 1970, 1973 and 1976 before opting to retire at the 1979 poll. Without Loxton's personal appeal, the Liberals lost the seat to the ALP upon his departure. As he continued to play first-class cricket for three years after his election to parliament, he was a busy man, and teammates described him as a hard-working representative, recalling that he often brought his political paperwork to the ground with him, going through the material while waiting in the dressing room for his turn to bat. Although he was a low-key presence in the parliamentary chambers, Loxton served on the library committee from 1958 to 1961, and he was known for his work ethic and thorough approach, as well as his \"sporting charisma\"."

        "title": "Sam Loxton_Cricket administration",
        "content": "Loxton continued to involve himself in cricket administration after his retirement as a player. He was a Victorian selector from 1957 to 1980\u201381 and the Prahran delegate to the Victorian Cricket Association from 1955\u201356 to 1979\u201380. Loxton was Prahran's vice president and was involved in coaching and selecting teams, and his service to the club was honoured with life membership. He served as a MCG trustee from 1962 to 1982. The Victorian was appointed as the manager for Australia's tour of India in 1969\u201370 but had to withdraw due to a clash of commitments. In his absence, the campaign hit rocky waters. Although Australia won 3\u20131, the players became disgruntled with the arrangements made by the administrators, while rancorous incidents leading to crowd riots were frequent. He was a Test selector for the Australian team from 1970 to 1981, filling the vacancy left by the retirement of former Test captain Ryder. Loxton's tenure on the selection panel coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket, on and off the field. Up until 1965, Australia had never lost a Test series to any country other than England, and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship. However, in the next five years, Australia lost away to the West Indies 2\u20131, and to South Africa twice, 3\u20131 and 4\u20130 respectively. The former all-rounder became a selector after the whitewash in South Africa, joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel. During the 1970\u201371 home series against England, which Australia lost 2\u20131, the trio made a raft of changes, handing debuts to nine players, the largest number in a season since 1945\u201346 when competition resumed after World War II. One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee, who went on to become one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers and the world's leading wicket-taker. However, the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate; he learned of his omission only second hand. In 1977, Loxton helped to select David Hookes to make his debut in the Centenary Test, after receiving a recommendation from Bradman, who had retired from the panel. Hookes famously struck five consecutive fours in one Tony Greig over in an Australian win. The later period of Loxton's tenure was thrown into chaos when most of the leading players abandoned the existing establishment to sign contracts with the breakaway World Series Cricket\u2014which offered substantially more remuneration\u2014meaning that an almost-entirely new team had to be cobbled together; the 42-year-old Bob Simpson was brought out of a decade of retirement to lead the outfit. During this time, Australia's depleted team suffered many heavy defeats. During the 1970s, Loxton also became more disillusioned with cricket, as player behaviour deteriorated and incidences of verbal hostility and altercations increased. The former all-rounder was known for his vigorous advocacy of the more sedate and gentlemanly conduct that existed during his playing days and felt that he and his fellow administrators were losing control of the sport. In February 1981, matters came to a head. Loxton, who was watching a one-day international between Australia and New Zealand at the MCG in his role as a selector, broke down and wept after Australian captain Greg Chappell infamously ordered his younger brother Trevor to exploit a loophole and bowl underarm to eliminate the chance of a defeat. Loxton saw the Australian skipper's action as a \"betrayal\" of cricket. He turned to a fellow official and remarked \"The game's gone! Money has become the god and winning is everything.\" At a VCA meeting in April 1981, Loxton announced that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers."

Loxton was a commentator on GTV-9 for the Melbourne Summer Olympics held in late 1956, and his co-commentators included American track and field icon Jesse Owens. After leaving parliament, the former politician joined the property developers Ellis, Sallmann and Seward. Loxton served as an administrator with various local groups. He was vice-president of the Victorian School for Deaf Children, president of the Prahran Technical School Council and a member of the Prahran College of Advanced Education Council. With regards to housing and social inclusion issues, he served as a committee member of the Glen Loch Home for the Aged and chairman of the Deakin Co-operative Housing Society. His opinions on contemporary cricket were frequently sought. \"People get a bit worried about me\", he told Cricinfo in 2008, \"Shane Warne's been a fine bowler\u2014no doubt about it, he's done some wonderful things\u2014but Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who have better strike-rates per match than Warne and never played against a 2nd XI [a reference to the likes of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe]\u2014they played only against the best\u2014had no rough to bowl at. I never had to bat to a leg-spinner who bowled into the rough outside my leg stump, and I played for a long time.\" Loxton married three times. He divorced his first wife Hilda in February 1952 after a nine-year union that produced no children. The cricketer then wed Caryl Bond, whom he had met during the 1949\u201350 tour of South Africa, and the pair had two sons. Loxton later divorced Bond and wed his third wife Joan Shiels. In 2000, one of his sons and his third wife died on the same day, due to a shark attack in Fiji and drowning in the family swimming pool, respectively. In later life he lived alone and was still mobile despite being almost blind. Loxton died on 3December 2011."

He became a born-again Christian in the early 1990s and led the NHL's Christian Fellowship . After retiring, Grimson finished his undergraduate degree and began law school. He completed his Juris Doctor degree in December 2005 at the University of Memphis Law School. He was In-House Counsel for the National Hockey League Players' Association and then worked for the Nashville law firm of Kay, Griffin, Enkema & Brothers, PLLC . He worked as a Color Analyst for the Nashville Predators on Fox Sports South and the team's flagship network, 102.5 The Game, through the 2016\u201317 season. Grimson appeared in a 2001 commercial spot for The Foundation for a Better Life. It begins with on-ice game action leading up to an intermission. While in the locker room with the team, Grimson receives a phone call. It is revealed that the caller is Grimson's young daughter, who asks him to sing \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\". He reluctantly complies, much to the amusement of his teammates. Grimson replies \"Hey, it's my girl! You know, my daughter?\" The commercial showed a softer side of Grimson as a good family man. During an October 6, 2011, edition of Hockey Night In Canada, Don Cherry accused Grimson, along with Chris Nilan and Jim Thomson, of being 'pukes' and 'hypocrites' for supposedly making a living as an enforcers and now complaining about it. Grimson, by then a licensed attorney, indicated that he considered legal action against Don Cherry on behalf of himself, Chris Nilan and Jim Thomson citing Cherry's claims as \"baseless and slanderous\".  After an apology on Hockey Night in Canada by Cherry, Grimson reconsidered his lawsuit against Cherry stating that \"This is a decision for Canadians. The CBC is your network; you pay for it.

After finishing as runners-up again in 1956\u201357, they joined the Spartan League. They finished as runners-up in 1963\u201364 and again in 1965\u201366, after which they switched to Division Two of the Athenian League. The 1968\u201369 season saw Boreham Wood win Division Two, earning promotion to Division One. The following season they finished as runners-up in Division One and were promoted to the Premier Division. After the division was disbanded in 1973, the club were placed in Division One for the 1973\u201374 season, in which they were league champions and reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, eventually losing 3\u20130 at Southend United. At the end of the season the club joined Division Two of the Isthmian League. They won the division in 1976\u201377 and were promoted to the renamed Premier Division. The following season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 2\u20130 in a replay to Swindon Town after a 0\u20130 draw at home. The club remained in the Premier Division until being relegated to Division One at the end of the 1981\u201382 season, in which they finished bottom of the table. In 1994\u201395 they were Division One champions, and were promoted back to the Premier Division. The 1996\u201397 season saw them reach the second round of the FA Cup for the first time after they beat Rushden & Diamonds 3\u20132 in a first round replay.

However, they were relegated again at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, although the season did see them reach the FA Cup first round again, where they lost 5\u20130 at Torquay United. After one season in Division One North , they were transferred to Division One East of the Southern League. After winning Division One East in 2005\u201306, a season in which they also reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, losing 3\u20130 on aggregate to Woking, the club were promoted to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League. A fourth-place finish in 2009\u201310 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs, and after beating Aveley 1\u20130 in the semi-finals, a 2\u20130 win over Kingstonian in the final resulted in promotion to the Conference South. The 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 seasons saw the club reach the FA Cup first round again, losing at home to Brentford and away at Carlisle United in a replay. In 2014\u201315 Boreham Wood finished as runners-up in the Conference South. In the subsequent play-offs, they beat Havant & Waterlooville 4\u20132 on aggregate before defeating Whitehawk 2\u20131 in the final to earn promotion to the renamed National League. Their first season in the National League saw a tenth FA Cup first round appearance, ending with a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Northwich Victoria.

After beating AFC Fylde 2\u20131 and Sutton United 3\u20132, they lost 2\u20131 to Tranmere Rovers in the Wembley final. In 2019\u201320 the club finished fifth and again qualified for the play-offs. After defeating Halifax Town 2\u20131 in the quarter-finals, they lost 1\u20130 to Harrogate Town in the semi-finals. The club reached the first round of the 2020\u201321 FA Cup, in which they defeated League Two club Southend United 4\u20133 on penalties after a 3\u20133 draw. They went on to beat Canvey Island 3\u20130 in the second round, earning a third round tie with Millwall, which they lost 2\u20130. In the 2021\u201322 FA Cup, the club reached the fifth round for the first time after beating League One club AFC Wimbledon in the third round and Championship club AFC Bournemouth in the fourth.

Chertsey Football Club was officially founded in 1890 and played its early matches in the West Surrey League. The club's first success came in the Surrey Junior Cup in 1897, and after a one-year postponement, the competition became the East and West Surrey League. A second halt in action followed during World War I, and Chertsey Town subsequently joined the Surrey Intermediate League in 1919. The club rejected an invitation to become founder members of the Surrey Senior League in 1923, and they remained in the league for two decades before World War II forced another break. In 1946, the Curfews attained senior status and finally joined the Surrey Senior League. The club later became known as Chertsey Town Football Club in 1951. After a few seasons of adapting to their new level, the club enjoyed a halcyon period and lifted their first league title during the 1569\u201360 season. They repeated their league success twice in the following three years, while also lifting the League Cup three times."

        "content": "Due to the static nature of amateur football, the club could not progress to the preferred Corinthian League, and opted to turn professional to join the Metropolitan League in 1963. The league consisted of several 'A' teams of professional clubs, including Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. However, after three seasons, the club decided the cost was too much to bear and temporarily joined the lower levels of the Greater London League for a single season. In 1967, the club joined the Spartan League and spent several seasons in the bottom half of the table. The Curfews enjoyed brief success as league and cup runners-up in the 1974\u201375 season, and became founder members of the London Spartan League the following year due to a merger with the Metropolitan-London League. However, they finished bottom of the league in the first season and consequently joined the Athenian League Division Two. After another bottom placed finish, the Athenian League Divisions One and Two merged and Chertsey Town faced an uninspiring seven-year spell, enduring two further bottom placed finishes and only a single top 10 finish. In 1984, the club joined the Isthmian League Division Two South but continued to struggle on the pitch. Just two wins from 36 matches and a three point deduction saw the club finish bottom of the league and relegated to the Combined Counties League. Nonetheless, success quickly returned to Alwyns Lane as the Curfews finished second and lifted the League Cup before returning to the Isthmian League."

        "content": "Chertsey Town's return to the Isthmian League immediately proved more successful with consecutive sixth-placed finishes. The club endured several strong seasons in the coming years, but were forced to join the new Division Three after a divisional split in 1991. However, the Curfews ensured their spell was a brief one and scored 115 goals en route to a runner's up position and a promotion spot. Following a season of consolidation back in Division Two, the club enjoyed another high-scoring campaign and netted 121 times as they finished one point below the league champions, while also lifting the League Cup, League Charity Shield and Carlsberg Trophy. Chertsey's dominant performances continued with the step up to Division One, and the club once again finished as the league's highest scorers while securing a promotion in third place. The Curfews enjoyed a respectable 15th place finish in their maiden campaign in the Premier Division, but struggled in the following 1996\u201397 season. A late rally of results proved insufficient in taking Chertsey off the bottom of the table and the club suffered their performance-based relegation in over a decade. After two seasons of mid-table obscurity, the 1999\u20132000 season produced another relegation back down to Division Two. Respectable positions were attained for the next two seasons before an Isthmian League re-structuring saw Chertsey Town allocated to the Division One South. However, the step up immediately proved too much for the club, and 139 goals conceded in 46 matches led to a return to Division Two. The Curfews found their footing in the division with top six finishes in all three seasons, but the dissolution of the division meant the club were allocated back to the Combined Counties League in 2006."

After an initial eighth place finish, the club improved every season and climbed to third before back-to-back runner's up spots. The 2010\u201311 season saw Chertsey finish three points behind league champions Guildford City, although resulted in their promotion with Guildford's ground unable to meet the demands of the higher tier's regulations. The Curfews were placed in the Southern League Division One Central and despite lowly finishes, ensured survival in their first two campaigns. However, the 2013\u201314 campaign proved too challenging for the club and the club suffered relegation to the Combined Counties after conceding 117 goals. Chertsey Town continued to struggle in the lower tier and finished 20th out of 21 teams in their first season back. The following campaign produced slight improvements, although the club finished in an underwhelming 18th position. It soon appeared that the Curfews had found their level in the Combined Counties League, with 19th and 15th place finishes as the league gradually expanded to 23 teams."

        "content": "In 2018, with the club struggling to progress from the ninth tier, former club chairman David Rayner returned to assist the club and help improve the playing squad. One of his first actions was the hiring of a new manager, helping to appoint former AFC Wimbledon boss Dave Anderson after a three-year hiatus. His arrival led to considerable changes and helped Chertsey Town find their form in the Combined Counties Premier Division. In Anderson's first full season in charge, the Curfews went on to win the league with six games to spare, finishing 13 points above their challengers and suffering just three defeats. In addition, forward Jake Baxter was named the league's top scorer with 35 goals in 29 games. However, the season is most fondly remembered for their FA Vase journey, which saw them compete in all ten rounds before being crowned winners at Wembley Stadium. The Curfews beat Woodley United and Tadley Calleva in the qualifying rounds, before recording an empathic 6\u20131 win against Flackwell Health in the First Round. Chertsey Town then struck 16 goals without reply against Horndean, Redbridge, AFC St. Austell, Irlam and West Auckland Town to progress to the semi-finals. In the first round to be played over two legs, they recorded a 1\u20131 draw away to Northwich Victoria before enduring a 0\u20130 stalemate after extra time in front of 1,847 supporters. With a penalty shoot required to separate the two teams, all five Chertsey Town players converted their kicks to secure a 5\u20133 shootout victory and a place in the final. On 19 May 2019, Chertsey Town were crowned FA Vase winners after a 3\u20131 victory against Cray Valley Paper Mills. After going a goal down in the first half, Sam Flegg quickly responded before Jake Baxter and Quincy Rowe sealed the win in extra time in front of 42,962 spectators. Following their league and cup success, Anderson immediately announced his retirement from football and club captain Kevin Maclaren was named his successor as player-manager. The club was promoted back to the Isthmian League and placed in the South Central Division, although saw their first two seasons curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, Rayner stepped down from his role as Director of Football. During the 2021\u201322 season, the club continued their cup success by reaching the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round for the first time in their history. After beating higher division Chesham United and handing Jersey Bulls their first ever competitive home defeat, the Curfews lost finally to National League club Southend United."

On rare occasions in the professional league competitions were allowed to compete some clubs' academies Metalurh, FC Dnipro-75 Dnipropetrovsk, others). Until 1999 second teams and third teams were allowed to compete in the Ukrainian Cup. Since 1999\u20132000 in Ukraine started to talk about reviving some kind of separate competition for such teams or youth competitions. In 2004 there was organized competition for the Vyshcha Liha teams doubles. Some doubles were formed out of already existing second  teams, other clubs kept their second teams as well as created additional doubles. It certainly reduced the number of second teams in regular league competitions as well eliminated some farm clubs. In 2008, championship among doubles was transitioned to youth competition as Vyshcha Liha was also transformed into Premier Liha. In 2012, there was introduced additional competition in Premier Liha, the under-19 championship . All these youth competitions \"cleaned\" the lower league structure of the second teams, but some clubs continue field them at national or regional levels. In Ukraine, second teams act same as farm teams and they do not have an age restriction as youth teams. Second teams are not allowed to compete in the same division with their primary team . On several occasions, the second team of Dynamo Kyiv won the Ukrainian First League, but was not allowed to be promoted to premiers where the primary team of Dynamo Kyiv competes due to the rule. As any rules there are some exceptions, the second team of FC Nyva Ternopil were allowed promotion to the same division after it lost its affiliation with the main club and promoted to professional ranks starting again from regional competitions.

They later transferred to the West Middlesex League before joining the Middlesex County League in 1984. League restructuring in 1991 saw Division One reduced from 22 to 12 clubs and renamed the Premier Division, with Hanworth relegated to the renamed Division One. However, a third-place finish in 1991\u201392 saw them promoted to the Premier Division. In 1993\u201394 the club were relegated to Division One despite finishing eighth. The following season they finished third in Division One, earning another immediate promotion back to the Premier Division. In 2002\u201303 Hanworth were Premier Division champions, also winning the Premier Division Cup with a 3\u20131 against Stonewall in the final.  They were champions again in 2004\u201305, after which they were promoted to Division One of the Combined Counties League. They won the Division One Challenge Cup in 2006\u201307 and retained it the following season which also saw them end the season as Division One runners-up. However, they were denied promotion due to their ground failing to meet the necessary criteria. After completing the work during the 2008\u201309 season, they were promoted at the end of the season after finishing as runners-up again. In 2011\u201312 Hanworth won the Southern Combination Challenge Cup and retained the trophy the following season. In 2013\u201314 they won the Southern Combination Challenge Cup for a second time, as well as winning the Combined Counties League Premier Challenge Cup, beating Spelthorne Sports in the final. The 2015\u201316 season saw them win the Middlesex Charity Cup for the first time, beating Cockfosters 2\u20130 in the final. They won the cup again in 2017\u201318 with a 3\u20132 win over Spelthorne Sports in the final."

        "content": "A fly route, also called a straight route, vertical route, streak route or go route, is a pattern run by a receiver in American football, where the receiver runs straight upfield towards the endzone. The goal of the pattern is to outrun any defensive backs and get behind them, catching an undefended pass while running untouched for a touchdown. Generally, the fastest receiver on the team or any receiver faster than the man covering him would be the one to run these routes. When run down the sidelines, a fly can be called a fade route. Fly patterns can also be used to clear out space for other receivers. Generally, a fly pattern will draw the attention of both the cornerback assigned to the receiver as well as \"over the top\" help from a safety. This can create a large gap in coverage, allowing another receiver to run a shorter route, but then gain many yards after the catch because the safety committed to the deep man. The famed \"Hail Mary\" play generally involves between three and five receivers all running fly routes in order to have the most chance of one of them catching the ball and scoring or at least gaining significant yardage."

His goal against N\u00e1utico during the 2005 play-offs earned Gr\u00eamio promotion to the Brazilian S\u00e9rie A. In January 2006, Anderson moved to Porto.

He fell out of favour at Manchester United following the departure of manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, and spent the second half of the 2013\u201314 season at Fiorentina before returning to Brazil with Internacional in January 2015.

Anderson earned himself iconic status by scoring the goal that lifted Gr\u00eamio back into Serie A in a promotion playoff against N\u00e1utico in November 2005. This goal was particularly memorable because Gr\u00eamio only had seven players on the pitch at the time and had just seen the opposition have a penalty saved.

The initial application for a work permit for Anderson was rejected on the ground that he did not have enough international caps. Manchester United subsequently argued that only his youth had prevented him from acquiring more caps and that, given his exceptional talent and the size of the transfer fee, clearance was justified. On 29 June 2007, he was granted a work permit to play in the United Kingdom, and the move was completed on 2 July, with Anderson signing a five-year contract to become United's second Brazilian player after Kl\u00e9berson. The transfer fee Porto announced was \u20ac30\u00a0million, which was equivalent to around \u00a320 million as of July 2007. Anderson was friends with Portuguese-speaking new teammates Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani prior to joining the club. He was handed the number 8 shirt, previously worn by Wayne Rooney, who changed to number 10, and made his Manchester United debut on 3 August 2007, playing 45 minutes of a pre-season friendly against Doncaster Rovers, which United won 2\u20130. On 1 September 2007, Anderson made his competitive debut for United against Sunderland, before he was substituted at half-time and replaced by striker Louis Saha, who eventually scored the game winner. Anderson made his Champions League debut against Sporting Clube de Portugal in a 0\u20131 away win on 19 September, coming on as a substitute for Ryan Giggs in the 76th minute. On 26 September, Anderson made his League Cup debut, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20130 loss to Coventry City, in a team consisting almost entirely of youth and reserve team players. In the 2008 Champions League final in Moscow, Anderson was brought on as a substitute in the final minute of extra time to replace Wes Brown, and converted United's sixth attempt in the penalty shootout. United won the game 6\u20135 on penalties to give Anderson the first European honour of his career."

On 7 December, Anderson scored his first goal at Old Trafford and also first European goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with Valencia. Anderson signed a new -year contract with United on 15 December, keeping him at the club until June 2015. Anderson doubled his United goal tally in one game as he scored twice in a 4\u20131 second leg semi-final home win over Schalke 04 in the Champions League. The game's aggregate score ended 6\u20131 to United and therefore reached the final for the third time in four years. In his next game, he scored only his second league goal for United, equalising against Blackpool on 22 May 2011, the final day of the league season, in a match that United went on to win 4\u20132."

The following October, he featured in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship and he won the Golden Ball as Brazil took second place. When Brazil were in danger of going out of the tournament after their opening game defeat against Gambia, Anderson helped to turn their fortunes around in the next match against the Netherlands. Anderson played well against the Dutch, contributing crosses and runs that aided his side. Anderson kept up his level of performance after that, scoring one goal and playing a key role in others, notably setting up Ramon for the first strike against Korea DPR in the quarter-final. After helping to lead Brazil into the final after a 4\u20133 semi-final victory over Turkey, Anderson lasted only 15 minutes of the final with Mexico before being stretchered off.

        "content": "Regarded as a talented and highly promising player in the media in his youth, Anderson later struggled to replicate his precocious performances as his career progressed, and has been accused by some pundits \u2013 including Marca's Fran Villalobos and  The Guardian's Barney Ronay \u2013 of failing to live up to his potential. Keith Griffin of Bleacher Report remarked in 2008 that Anderson was \"[o]ne of the most impressive young players to grace the Premier League this season,\" noting that the midfielder was gifted \"with blinding pace, hulkish upper body strength, and vision.\" Alex Ferguson added that Anderson \"can tackle, he's lightning quick, he's brave and he can pass the ball.\" In 2009, Will Evans of Bleacher Report described him as a player gifted with pace, physical strength, flair, and technical skills, as well noting his range of passing, crossing ability, defensive skills, and accuracy from penalties as some of his key strengths. He also cited that although Anderson was capable of creating chances for teammates, his biggest weaknesses were his shooting accuracy and lack of goals going forward, something which Ferguson had also previously noted. He felt that Anderson's best positions were either as a central midfielder or as a winger, although Evans's colleague Sam Tighe noted in 2013 that the Brazilian was often deployed as an attacking midfielder in his youth, and was also capable of playing in other positions, and was even used as a deep-lying playmaker on occasion; he labelled him as a dangerous free kick taker with good acceleration and dribbling ability. Regarding Anderson's difficulties in living up to his potential during his time at Manchester United, Chris Atkins of Bleacher Report commented: \"Before joining Porto, Anderson was touted as the next Ronaldinho. Having emerged through the Gremio academy system as a tricky attacking midfielder, the comparisons were only natural and, prior to his injury in Portugal, the signs were promising. With excellent acceleration, impressive close control and a powerful shot, he certainly appeared to be an important player for Brazil's future.\" A left-footed player, his other most noticeable trait was his stamina. Anderson's former Manchester United teammate Michael Owen described the former as \"very talented\" and surmised that his failure to establish himself at the top level was due to his mentality and poor work-rate, combined with his injuries, health issues, and his struggle to operate in different positions, with Tighe noting that Anderson performed poorly when he was deployed in both a holding and a box-to-box role. Former Brazil midfielder Tost\u00e3o also criticised Anderson for his static off-the-ball movement when commenting on his performance at the 2005 U17 World Cup, during which he won the Golden Ball after leading Brazil to the final, stating: \"He was clearly the best player, but there were times when he just stood around.\""

Manolo Saiz, one of few managers who was not a former rider, introduced more professional management, closer supervision in coaching, equipment and training. In the 2003 Vuelta he was banned from the race after insulting a motorcycle-mounted TV cameraman, his comments broadcast live. ONCE team was known for its association with Laurent Jalabert and Alex Z\u00fclle in the 1990s, dominating spring races such as Paris\u2013Nice, La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne and the Tour de Romandie. The team won the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in 1995, 1996 and 1997. It dominated the 1995 Vuelta with Jalabert winning overall, the points competition and the mountains. It was also best team, with Johan Bruyneel third. Bruyneel became a directeur sportif and instituted a world-class doping program that helped Lance Armstrong win seven consecutive Tours de France . ONCE team in the Tour de France had stage wins from Jalabert and domination in the team time trial. Z\u00fclle won the Vuelta in 1996 and 1997 but left the team in 1998. The team signed the 1998 winner and individual time trial specialist, Abraham Olano, who challenged in the 1999 Vuelta but never won a second Grand Tour. Joseba Beloki became leader and challenged Armstrong in the 2002 and 2003 Tours. Isidro Nozal led the 2003 Vuelta until Roberto Heras took the lead on the penultimate day. ONCE's sponsorship was so successful that brand penetration was 100% in Spain, meaning every Spaniard surveyed knew ONCE.  At the end of 2003 ONCE stopped sponsorship. Saiz obtained a new sponsor, Liberty Mutual. Most of the riders stayed, including Isidro Nozal and Igor Gonz\u00e1lez de Galdeano. Saiz signed Heras; he did not perform well at the 2004 Tour de France but won the 2004 Vuelta after a battle with Santiago P\u00e9rez."

Alexander Vinokourov joined in 2006 for three seasons to challenge for top finish in the Tour de France.  Fellow Kazakhstan riders Andrei Kashechkin, formerly of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, and Sergei Yakovlev also joined. On 25 November, Roberto Heras was fired after a urine sample from the 2005 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, which he had won, tested positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO. Heras was stripped of what would have been a record-breaking fourth win and banned for two years."

Liberty Mutual retracted sponsorship on 25 May 2006, promising only to finance current obligations. On 2 June 2006, the team acquired a new primary sponsor - named Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan - for three years, with an option to extend to six. It was headed by a consortium of five Kazakh companies. Long before Saiz was ensnared in Operaci\u00f3n Puerto, the team had been notorious for doping dating back to its days as ONCE, and was considered one of the dirtiest teams in the European peloton. On June 30, 2006, Astana-W\u00fcrth was excluded from the 2006 Tour de France after five riders were implicated in a doping scandal, leaving Vinokourov with three remaining teammates, below the minimum six for the Tour. W\u00fcrth stopped its commitment on 3 of July. On 26 July 2006, the five riders excluded from the Tour were cleared by Spanish officials, and the team returned to competition at the Tour of Germany in August, Assan Bazayev winning the first stage. One rider, Joseba Beloki, would never ride a professional race again. At the end of 2006, Saiz listed Astana as his team's backer. Astana also claimed to have withdrawn support due to non-participation in the Tour. On 16 December 2006, the UCI withdrew the ProTour license of Saiz's Active Bay company."

The ground was officially opened on 25 June 1921 and City Rovers defeated Maritime 10\u20138 on the opening day in front of 7,000 fans. Herb Lunn scored the first try and Eric Grey kicked the first goal on the ground. The ground hosted the sole test match in the New Zealand leg of the 1951 French rugby league tour of Australasia. The Auckland Rugby League spent \u00a34,322 on capital expenditure in developing the ground. The ground was purchased for $200,000 in 1974. The ground hosted 3 Winfield Cup games with the first game between Newcastle and Manly Warringah attracting 17,368 spectators. Strong attendances across these matches led to the inclusion of the Auckland Warriors into the Winfield Cup in 1995. During its long history it hosted many matches in various Rugby League World Cups. The stadium capacity was officially listed as 17,000 when it closed in 2002 due to health and safety reasons. Between 1924 and 1999 Carlaw Park hosted sixty-six Test matches. The largest Test crowd was an estimated 28,000 during the 1928 England tour. New Zealand won the game, defeating England 17\u201313. The final rugby league test at the ground came on 22 October 1999 when New Zealand defeated Tonga 74\u20130 in front of the ground's lowest ever test crowd of 4,528."

Carlaw Park was one of the venues under consideration for Stadium New Zealand, a proposed stadium to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Complications over the lease of the property, the requirement for additional land to be taken from Auckland Domain, and the proximity of the heavy traffic on Stanley Street led to other options being preferred by the Government. The backers of Carlaw Park hosting the Cup secured NZ$200 million for its possible development, but the government finally chose Eden Park to host the World Cup games. Carlaw Park is now the site of a Caltex service station, several offices, a Quest Apartments hotel building, and the University of Auckland's largest student accommodation Carlaw Park Student Village. Since mid-November 2018, Carlaw Park has been connected by a walkway to the Parnell railway station."

However, due to the competition at the club, Donati was unable to retain a first team place after his first season, spending the 2002\u201303 season on loan at Parma and then Torino. The 2003\u201304 season, his third as a Milan player, saw him join Sampdoria on loan, before enjoying a successful spell at Messina for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons. Despite finding his form at Messina, Donati still found himself out of favour at Milan and was again sent on loan, this time returning to his first club Atalanta for the 2006\u201307 season.

        "content": "On 29 June 2007, Celtic confirmed the signing of Donati on a four-year contract for a fee of \u20ac2 million. Donati was given the number 18 jersey, vacated by ex-captain Neil Lennon and was unveiled at Celtic Park. He made his Celtic debut in their first league game of the season on 5 August, a 0\u20130 draw with Kilmarnock. In Celtic's next league game against Falkirk, Donati was involved in his side's equaliser when his shot hit Kenny Milne and went into the net; Celtic won the game 4\u20131. The following week, Donati grabbed his first competitive Celtic goal with an equalising goal against Aberdeen and later added an assist for Kenny Miller as Celtic won 3\u20131. On 28 November, Donati won the match for Celtic in the UEFA Champions League fixture against Shakhtar Donetsk, netting in the 92nd minute to win the match 2\u20131. This result meant Celtic only needed a point away to Donati's former club Milan at the San Siro to qualify for the last 16 stage of the tournament. Celtic lost 1\u20130 to Milan, but still qualified for the last 16 as runners-up in their group after Benfica defeated Shakhtar in Ukraine. As the season went on, Donati's form began to dip, resulting in the central midfield positions being changed with Barry Robson and Paul Hartley in place of Donati and Scott Brown. In May 2008, it was reported that Donati wanted to go back to Serie A. In the 2008\u201309 season, Donati made only a handful of appearances for Celtic, though he started in the home game against Kilmarnock on 12 November 2008 and won the man of the match award. After the appointment of Tony Mowbray as Celtic manager, Donati won back his place in the Celtic midfield alongside new signing Landry N'Gu\u00e9mo. Donati played in most of the pre-season games and scored in a 5\u20130 win over African Champions League winners Al-Ahly in the Wembley Cup. He started the 2009\u201310 campaign in fine form and scored from a spectacular volley in Celtic's 3\u20131 loss to Arsenal in the Champions League play-off."

In 1889, they were challenged to a match by a nearby team from Ballingarry and Shinrone. In the early 1900s, the club became known as Moneygall. The club was combined with Toomevara for a decade or so from 1910 onwards. Several Tipperary Senior Hurling Championships were won at this time, but since the team's name was Toomevara, the \"Greyhounds\" received the laurels and entered the roll of honour under the Toomevara club name. In January 1917, Moneygall's Jer Collison became the first man from the North Tipperary division to win an All Ireland senior hurling medal with Tipperary, playing on the Tipperary team that beat Kilkenny in the delayed 1916 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final. In 1935 a hurling pitch, St. Flannan's Park, was developed adjacent to the village. A perimeter wall was built in 1959 enclosing the playing pitch. In 1977 a stand and clubhouse with dressing rooms, hall, office, shop and handball alley were built in the grounds. This building was extended in 2009 to include an extra dressing room and a meeting room. In 2013 a patch of land was purchased adjacent to the existing grounds, and following seven years of fundraising and development a second playing field and community walkway opened for use in 2020. From 1967 to 1970, Moneygall's S\u00e9amus \u00d3 Riain was President of the Gaelic Athletic Association. During his tenure he helped establish F\u00e9ile na nGael, the annual national Under 14 hurling festival which was first held in 1971, and is hosted by different counties every year. U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle visited Moneygall on 23 May 2011. The President's entourage faced gale-force winds to fly from the Phoenix Park in Dublin in two Chinook and two Black Hawk helicopters. The violent winds exceeded normal conditions for helicopter flying, and some passengers became sick during the 40 minute trip. The party landed in St. Flannan's Park in wet and blustery conditions. One of the President's advisers was felled by a blast of wind and papers she was carrying were scattered across the hurling pitch, pursued by Garda\u00ed."

After a couple of attempts, Zelepukin buried the puck past Ranger goaltender Mike Richter to tie the game. Richter protested to referee Bill McCreary that he had been interfered with, but the goal stood. Zelepukin's goal went for nought, however, when New York's St\u00e9phane Matteau scored a dramatic wrap-around goal on Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur in double-overtime to win the game and the series for the Rangers. The Rangers would go on to defeat the Vancouver Canucks to win their first Stanley Cup in 54 years, but Zelepukin and the Devils redeemed themselves the next year, when they won their first Stanley Cup championship in a four-game sweep of the Detroit Red Wings. Zelepukin also coached KHL team Metallurg Novokuznetsk during the 2016-17 season. However, Zelepukin was fired after the team had a 1-8-0 record."

Varis was originally implicated, but later was cleared in this scandal. Varis's best individual finish at the Winter Olympics was fourth in the 15\u00a0km at Salt Lake City in 2002.

Varis attended the 30\u00a0km event, but was later disqualified for taking EPO, an endurance-enhancing drug, and served a two-year suspension as a result.

The next weekend, the Flyers defeated Washington 64\u201358 to advance to the Elite Eight. The Flyers eventually fell to eventual champion Georgetown, 61\u201349. The team's performance that year earned it the rank of No. 7 on Hall of Fame Magazine's list of \"Cinderella Stories\". Chapman scored 105 points in the four tournament games as the Flyers' season ended with a 23\u201311 record. Chapman was referred to by Dayton students by his nickname, \"Velvet\", which is both a play on his first name and a description of his smooth playing style. He received a bachelor's degree from Dayton in 1990. In 1994, he was inducted into the University of Dayton Athletic Hall of Fame. He is the all-time leading scorer at the University of Dayton and also for being on the latter's basketball Hall of Fame."

On June 25, Terps coach Ralph Friedgen told reporters that Gaither's grades failed to meet his expectations, that he would not be able to play in 2007 and he would be eligible to return in 2008. Instead, Gaither declared for the NFL's supplemental draft and on July 12 was taken by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round. Gaither took over Jonathan Ogden's starting left tackle role after Ogden's retirement. At the time, Gaither, at 6'9, was one of the tallest players in the NFL, the others being Dennis Roland of the Cincinnati Bengals and Demar Dotson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During the start of off-season camps for the 2008 NFL season, offensive coordinator Cam Cameron declared Gaither would be the starting left tackle. Despite an early ankle injury during the beginning of training camp, he played surprisingly well and was a big reason for the improved offensive line of the Baltimore Ravens. On October 4, 2009, he suffered a head injury in a game vs. the New England Patriots and was sent to the hospital. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, and had movement in his arms and legs.  In addition, x-rays on his neck and shoulder were negative. Gaither missed all of 2010 after an injury put him on Injured Reserve ."

However, Thiago's impact at Stockholms Stadion was far from impressive and during the 2006 season, he scored only one goal and was regularly used as a substitute, if at all being part of the match squad. While this may be true, it is clear to see that the transfer from the Brazilian way of futbol to the Swedish football way took its toll on his game. Quirino did score in the derby against AIK on 24 September, making it 1\u20130 to his side. On 21 November 2008 it was revealed that Quirino had officially been transferred to the newly relegated J. League team Consadole Sapporo. The reported transfer sum was 2,5 million SEK, far less than the 14 million SEK it was reported that Djurg\u00e5rden themselves spent 3 years earlier. On 17 January 2011, Daegu FC was officially announced his signing of a 1-year loan contract. on 23 January 2012, he loaned back to Consadole Sapporo."

        "content": "The year 1966 saw a series of events that had a major impact on Roy's future career. Three separate groups decided to form a professional league in the U.S. Through various negotiations, two of the groups merged to form the National Professional Soccer League . While the USSF and FIFA refused to recognize the NPSL, it gained a television contract with CBS, thereby guaranteeing some element of financial stability. Up to this point, Roy played almost exclusively with local Chicago minor league teams and the U.S. national team. Once again, external soccer events impacted Roy's career. The NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association in December 1967 to form the North American Soccer League. That year, the Spurs also moved to Kansas City. Roy moved with the team and spent one season there. Roy experienced a sophomore slump in 1968, playing 15 games, scoring 6 goals and assisting on 4 others. However, the team played well, losing to the Atlanta Chiefs in the playoff semifinals. Roy moved on to the Saint Louis Stars in 1971. In his three seasons with the Stars, he scored 18 goals and assisted on 16 others. In 1972, the team made it to the NASL final, losing to the New York Cosmos 2\u20131. After retiring from the national team, Roy continued to play professionally for a few more years. In 1975, he moved to his last team, the expansion Chicago Sting. He would play a single season with the Sting, statistically the worst of his career. He scored no goals and made 3 assists in 14 games. He retired from playing at the end of the season."

He earned his second cap nine days later in a tie with Honduras which ended the U.S. attempt to qualify for the 1966 World Cup. Roy enjoyed relative success with the national team in 1968. He played eight games, scoring six goals. In those eight games, the national team went 4\u20133\u20131. More significantly, four of those games were qualifying matches for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. In those three games, the U.S. went 3\u20131 with Roy scoring 3 goals. The next year, he played only a single game with the national team, a 2\u20130 loss to Haiti. That game, combined with a second loss to Haiti a month later spelled the end to yet another U.S. attempt to qualify for a World Cup. Roy would not play for the national team again until it began playing qualification games for the 1974 World Cup. In 1972, Roy played four games with the national team, all 1974 World Cup qualifying matches. The U.S. went 0\u20133\u20131, failing to reach yet another World Cup. Despite the team's dismal showing, Roy scored in three consecutive games, giving him a record six goals in World Cup qualifying matches. The next player to score in three consecutive matches did not come until Cobi Jones did it in 2000. Roy's record of six goals in world cup qualifying matches lasted until Earnie Stewart scored his seventh qualifying goal in 2001. Roy played five more games with the national team, all in 1973. That year, he scored once, ending his national team career with 20 games and 10 goals, one of the best scoring rates by any national team member over a sustained career."

        "content": "In 1976, upon retiring from playing, Roy became an assistant coach for Chicago Sting. He spent two seasons in this position, before moving up to head coach in 1979. In 1981, Roy coached the Sting to a 23\u20139 record and a victory in the Soccer Bowl and earned himself NASL Coach of the Year honors. The summer of 1984 saw Roy coach the Sting to its second NASL outdoor title. This would also be the last NASL championship as the league folded the following Spring. The Major Indoor Soccer League had commenced operations in 1978, and it proved its success in its first two years of operation as it gained teams and the NASL lost teams to financial failure. The NASL attempted to piggyback on the MISL success, by playing an indoor season beginning in the winter of 1979\u20131980, following its 1979 outdoor season. Roy's Sting did not do well in that first season indoors, but things improved drastically during the 1980\u20131981 indoor season. He guided them to a division title, the league's best regular-season record, and into the finals, where they lost to the Edmonton Drillers, two games to none. The following season saw another division title, but this time they made an early exit from the playoffs. The NASL did not hold a full indoor season in 1982\u201383, so the Sting played that winter in the MISL where it finished third in the Eastern Division. Roy got the Sting on track during the 1983\u201384 indoor season, back again in the NASL. They finished second in the standings and lost to the New York Cosmos in the playoff semifinals. With the demise of the NASL, the Sting became a full-time member of the MISL. Roy coached the Sting for two more seasons. The team lost to the Cleveland Force in the 1985 quarterfinals but missed the playoffs in 1986, finishing with a 23\u201325 record. A 2\u20138 start the following campaign led to Roy being replaced by Erich Geyer on December 23, 1986. During his time with the Sting, Roy did more than win two championships. He had an impact that went beyond the team when he coached the former Dutch National Team Head Coach Dick Advocaat and United States women's national soccer team Greg Ryan. Ryan later credited Roy with being a strong influence on his development as a player and coach. Ryan said, \"The thing that defined Willy was, he was one of the most intense competitors as a player and that carried over to his coaching. He was so intense and so determined that he brought that quality out in his players. If he mentioned people who went on to bigger and better things, it was because they learned to work so hard and give so much.\" Roy was named the men's soccer head coach at Northern Illinois University on August 12, 1987. In 1990, the Huskies had the Mid-Continent Conference's best record and Roy was selected as the Mid-Con's Coach of the Year. The school announced on February 18, 2003, that it was not renewing Roy's contract after the Huskies had three consecutive losing seasons. He finished with a 142\u2013131\u201322 coaching record and two conference championships. During his time with the team, it was known for the high academic standards Roy set for his players. Although his last season with the team saw a dismal 4\u201313\u20131, the Huskies ranked in the Division-I Academic top 20."

In 1963-64, he scored 9 times in 37 league matches, which was the best scoring spell of his career. Many believed that his apparent lack of pace and power reduced the effectiveness of such a skilled player. When his brother Barry made the Blades first team, the pair were often in and out of the side.

He turned professional in January 1957, but did not make his debut until October 1959, in a 0\u20130 draw against Bolton Wanderers. He went on to make 163 appearances for The Baggies, including the 1966 and 1967 League Cup finals. He was one of the very few defenders to score a hat trick in a top level match v. Stoke City Sept 12th 1964. He is perhaps most remembered for being the captain of the Colchester United team that beat Leeds United in the 1971 FA Cup, one of the greatest shocks in the competition's history. In 1968, he went on loan with the Vancouver Royals in the North American Soccer League. He returned to the NASL in 1974, this time with the Seattle Sounders."

He was brought in to bring a physical presence to the Flames lineup, but added an offensive presence for the Flames while playing in a limited role. He scored a career-high 10 goals during the 2010\u201311 NHL season, only one shy of his career total entering the season. He was named recipient of the J. R. \"Bud\" McCaig Award, given to a Flames player who exhibits respect, courtesy and compassion. On November 21, 2013 he was traded to the Anaheim Ducks for a 6th round pick in 2014. In the 2015\u201316 season, Jackman played in two games with the Ducks before he was placed on waivers and reassigned to their AHL affiliate, the San Diego Gulls on November 3, 2015. At the trade deadline, Jackman's tenure with the Ducks came to an end as he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Corey Tropp. Despite the trade, Jackman was assigned to continue with the San Diego Gulls for the remainder of the season before sitting out to undergo back surgery. In the following off-season, Jackman opted out of contract to end his professional career, returning to Minnesota State University to complete an Education degree and contribute to the Coaching staff with the Mavericks."

        "content": "Graham Oates is an English former professional footballer. He played as a midfielder. Oates began his career with Ron Suart's Blackpool in 1961. He made his debut for the Division One club on 16 September 1961, in a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Nottingham Forest. He made just three more league appearances during the 1961\u201362 campaign, but scored Blackpool's goal in their 1\u20131 draw with Leyton Orient in their League Cup second round, first leg tie on 4 October 1961. In 1962\u201363, Oates made only one appearance in the entire season \u2013 goalless draw at Sheffield Wednesday on 27 October 1962. The following season, 1963\u201364, he made 25 league appearances and scored eight goals. On four occasions, a single strike by Oates was enough to give Blackpool a victory: against Fulham at Bloomfield Road on 30 September 1963; against West Bromwich Albion at home on 16 November, against Stoke City, again at Bloomfield Road, on 8 February 1964; and at Nottingham Forest in the very next game seven days later. He also scored one goal in the League Cup, in Blackpool's 7\u20131 second-round victory over Charlton Athletic at Bloomfield Road on 25 September 1963. In 1964\u201365, Oates made 30 appearances and scored twelve goals in the league, finishing second-top scorer behind Ray Charnley. Oates' strike-rate dried up in 1965\u201366, with only one goal in 21 league appearances, and in the first two-thirds of the 1966\u201367 campaign, Ron Suart gave Oates only three starts. Stan Mortensen replaced Suart in the Blackpool hot seat in the New Year, and the former Blackpool striker provided more opportunities in the team. Oates scored in the final league game of the season, a 3\u20131 victory against Liverpool at Anfield on 13 May 1967. Blackpool, however, had already been relegated to Division Two at that point. In Stan Mortensen's first full season in charge, 1967\u201368, Oates made 23 league appearances and scored three goals . Oates' final appearance for Blackpool occurred seven games into the 1968\u201369 season, in a single-goal victory over Bolton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road on 7 September 1968. He joined Grimsby Town, with whom he went on to make 81 league appearances and score nine goals in three years. Oates also played for Wigan Athletic in the early 1970s, scoring 30 goals in 100 Northern Premier League appearances."

She has an older sister named Sarah and two older brothers named Lee and Peter, the latter of whom is a mathematics professor at Dublin City University. Her father, who was born near Leeds and grew up in Birmingham, first visited Bray to work with his father in the amusement arcades on the seafront. After meeting and marrying Bridget, he decided to settle in Bray. In 1986, he became an Irish senior light heavyweight champion boxer. Originally an electrician by trade, he eventually became Taylor's full-time boxing coach. He also coached Adam Nolan who, like Taylor, represented Ireland at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Bridget also developed an interest in boxing and became one of the earliest female referees and judges in Ireland. Between 1999 and 2005, Taylor attended St. Kilian's Community School in Bray. Her three older siblings all attended the same school. As well as boxing and playing association football at school, she also played ladies' Gaelic football and camogie with her local GAA clubs, Bray Emmets and Fergal \u00d3gs. She was a member of Bray Runners, a local athletics club, and several American colleges reportedly offered her sports scholarships while she was still studying at St Killian's. However, she opted instead to attend University College Dublin, known for its sports scholarship programme, which she qualified for via her Leaving Cert results. As her sporting career began to take off, she chose not to complete her studies at UCD."

One judge scored the bout 98\u201391 and the other two scored it 97\u201392."

        "content": "Taylor's first fight of 2019 was another unification bout, facing WBO female lightweight champion Rose Volante on 15 March at the Liacouras Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Taylor started the fight strong, using her combination punching and movement to take control, dropping Volante to the canvas with a right hand in the opening round. The second round saw Taylor stay behind the jab, keeping her opponent at range as Volante attempted to close the distance and fight at close quarters. Volante switched tactics in the third round, staying in the centre of the ring and waiting for Taylor to press the action. Taylor obliged, but the Irish champion's footwork allowed her to get in-and-out before Volante could land any meaningful punches. After much of the same in the fourth, Taylor began to pile on the pressure in the fifth, switching her attacks from head to body to find an opening with a powerful body shot to hurt Volante. Round six saw Taylor pierce the guard of Volante with straight punches, leaving her opponent with a bloodied nose. Volante had moments of success in the seventh round with heavy punches to the body of Taylor, before the Irish woman resumed her attacks to regain control. Taylor continued her success in the eighth, landing an overhand right followed by a rapid six-punch combination. After Volante was on the receiving end of a flurry of punches, and with a cut over her nose which appeared to be the result of a clash of heads, referee Benjy Esteves stepped in and called a halt to the contest to hand Taylor a ninth-round TKO victory and her third world title. In the post-fight interview, Taylor declared her intentions of becoming the undisputed female lightweight champion, saying; \"Now we can start talking about that fight, Persoon. That name's been coming up over the last two years. I've got the three belts, she's got the WBC belt, so we have to get that fight on next.\""

        "content": "In December 2018, Irish journalist Evanne N\u00ed Chuilinn stated that Taylor accused Delfine Persoon of turning down a \"life-changing\" amount of money to fight her. Later Persoon claimed to have offered $100,000 to Taylor for a fight. Taylor's manager stated that Taylor wouldn't even get out of bed for this sum. On 15 April 2019, Taylor and Persoon agreed to a lightweight title unification bout, to take place on 1 June at Madison Square Garden as undercard for the Anthony Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz Jr. heavyweight title fight. In addition to all four sanctioning body's titles being on the line, The Ring magazine belt was also at stake. Persoon's management labelled Taylor's team \"totally disrespectful\" and claimed \"psychological warfare\" after a series of demands late in the fight week. This included a claim of forcing Persoon to switch hotels on the grounds that Taylor was staying in the same hotel, and demands for an additional blood test and to prove Persoon has exercise asthma. Taylor's team denied expelling Persoon's team from the hotel, but claimed that there was a clause in the contract allowing them to do so which Persoon's manager should have been aware of. Although, in a different interview Taylor's team stated it was not done by them, but by the organizers and that they had no idea about this forced move out of the hotel. Taylor's team accused Persoon's manager of purposefully attempting to stir controversy by booking his fighter into the hotel Taylor was staying at. From the opening bell, Taylor came under relentless pressure from Persoon, forcing the Irish champion to fight off the back foot and rely on counter punching. After having success in the first round, Taylor began to have difficulties with Persoon's pressure in the second and third, with the Belgian champion employing roughhouse tactics in the clinch. Taylor suffered a cut to her forehead in the fourth round. In the fifth, with Taylor ahead on all three judges' scorecards, she spent the majority of the round with her back against the ropes, still engaging with Persoon and having success. Taylor found more success in the sixth, scoring with counter punches while making Persoon miss as the Belgian began to tire. The tables turned in the eighth as Taylor also looked to be tiring, with the highlight of the round being a solid right hand from Persoon to stop Taylor in her tracks. The Irish champion rallied back in the ninth to land her trademark rapid-fire combinations. The tenth and final round was a back-and-forth affair as both fighters traded punches to try and close the show as the stronger fighter. After the final bell rang Taylor secured the win via majority decision , with two judges scoring the bout in favour of Taylor at 96\u201394 while the third judge scored it a draw at 95\u201395, crowning Taylor the first undisputed female lightweight champion. According to CompuBox stats, Taylor landed 103 of 410 punches, while Persoon landed 116 of 586 . Controversy ensued regarding the decision, with some ringside media outlets and boxers feeling Persoon did enough to get the win. Former two-weight world champion Carl Frampton said, \"In my opinion, the judges have got it wrong\", and described the decision as \"disgraceful\". Former two-weight world champion David Haye said, \"That is not the sight you want to see where someone has given everything in the gym but they do not get the decision because of the political power. Delfine Persoon is going to be heartbroken by that.\" ESPN's unofficial scorecard also had Persoon winning by a small margin. DAZN commentator Brian Kenny also thought Persoon had won, but explained that the fight was close and did not dispute the judges' decision. Michael Woods, writing for The Ring magazine, argued the decision \"was no robbery\"."

The champion started the fight as the aggressor, forcing Taylor to fight off the back foot. The Irish challenger found success at the end of the round with two solid right hands as the bell rang. Taylor started to find her rhythm in the second round, scoring punches while using her fast footwork to make her opponent miss. The third round saw more of the same with Taylor staying behind the jab and landing left hooks. Linardatou found success in the fourth and fifth rounds, landing multiple right hands and leaving Taylor with swelling above her right eye. Taylor began regaining control in the sixth, using her footwork and landing her signature rapid combinations. Round eight saw Taylor plant her feet and trade punches, landing a combination of power punches before taking a solid right hand from the champion that stopped Taylor in her tracks. After critical comments from her corner for taking too many punches in the eighth round, Taylor got back to her boxing for the next two rounds, coasting to a UD victory with the scorecards reading 97\u201393, 97\u201393, and 96\u201394. With the win Taylor became only the third boxer from Ireland, after Steve Collins and Carl Frampton, to capture world titles in two weight divisions."

He represented Wales at Under-21 level. Thomas began his career as a trainee with Blackburn Rovers, turning professional in August 1997. He struggled to establish himself at Ewood Park and was loaned to a number of clubs before being released at the end of the 2001\u201302 season. A highlight of his loan spells was when he scored the winning goal for Sheffield United against Preston North End, helping them win 3-2 when they had at one stage trailed 2\u20130. Another loan spell at Bristol Rovers yielded one goal against Rochdale. He scored three goals during his time at Blackburn; once in the league against Bolton Wanderers and twice in a League Cup tie against Portsmouth. In May 2002 he joined Swansea City and quickly established himself in the first team. He is fondly remembered for the hat-trick he scored in a 4\u20132 victory over Hull on the last day of the 2002\u201303 season to save his hometown club from relegation to the Football Conference. With Swansea he became Wales' most capped player at Under-21 level and was called up to the full squad for the match away to Azerbaijan in November 2002, but did not get to play. Thomas later suffered a knee injury that kept him out of the game for two years. He joined Llanelli in August 2006. After a short time playing in Australia, he returned to Wales where he now works as an ambulance driver."

Osler played mainly at fly-half for both South Africa, and his provincial team of Western Province. Osler was born at Aliwal North. He was first selected to play on 16 August 1924 against the Lions when they toured South Africa. This was the first of his 17 consecutive Test appearances for South Africa. Osler played in the other three Tests of the Lions tour, and contributed to South Africa winning three of the four Tests. The only Test of the series the Springboks did not win was their 3\u20133 draw in Port Elizabeth where Osler was temporarily knocked out. The next Springbok series was hosting New Zealand's All Blacks in 1928. The teams had met once before in a Test series, drawn 1\u20131 in New Zealand in 1921. The first Test was played in Durban and the Springboks won 17\u20130, with Osler scoring a world record 14 points in the match. Osler played in the remaining three Tests and the series was eventually drawn 2\u20132; just like in 1921. Osler's first overseas tour was in 1931 when he captained the Springboks on their 1931\u201332 tour to the Home Nations. He captained the team and played in all four Tests; playing against England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Osler's Springboks became the second South African team, and only second of all time, to win a Grand Slam\u2014a win over all four Home Nations on one tour. The tour continued into 1932 and the team eventually played 26 matches, with only one loss. In 1933 Osler played in his last Test series when Australia toured South Africa. They played a five match series and Osler played in all five Tests, with the Springboks winning the series by 3 tests to 2. During the series he scored a try, conversion and drop-goal. Osler is remembered as a fly-half who played a kicking game; that is, he would often kick for territory rather than run with the ball, or pass to his backs. His accuracy when kicking allowed South African teams he was in to play a forward oriented game, commonly referred to as ten-man rugby. His contributions to international rugby were acknowledged with his induction into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009."

In 2002 they were relocated to Hamburg in order to grow and were renamed. After the relocation they experienced financial difficulties and almost lost their licence for the German First League of Handball. With personal investments of the new president Andreas Rudolph in 2005, the club was able to focus again on the sporting operation. Although known locally as HSV Hamburg, the club is not a division of Hamburger Sportverein, they had the rights to use their logo and their abbreviation for publicity purposes. The rights for the name and logo were rescinded when the team was disqualified from the Handball Bundesliga On 20 January 2016, their license was removed due to irregularities, and as a result Handball Hamburg were not given a licence to participate in either First or Second Handball Bundesliga during 2016/17 season. As a result, the club was relaunched under a new crest, colours and new identity, from HSV Hamburg to Handball Sport Verein Hamburg; although the official name was kept the same."

The club paid him $100 per goal he scored. In 1978, he joined the youth system of Rangers de Talca. He also spent time on loan with San Javier, another youth squad. In 1979, Rubio had an offer to sign with Chilean club San Luis Quillota, an established team. However, he decided to stay with Rangers since he was studying at the time at Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Talca . His first two professional goals came on 6 August 1979 in the '63 and '80 minutes. In 1981, he helped Rangers gain promotion to Chilean First Division. He became very popular among the Rangers supporters during his time with the club. His good form piqued the interest of Chilean club Cobreloa, who would be playing in the Copa Libertadores. Cobreloa signed Rubio in 1982 and went on to place as runner-up in 1982 Copa Libertadores. In 1982, he won the Chilean national title. He stayed with the club until 1985. During his time with Cobreloa he made a name for himself in all of Chile. Rubio's good form led him to be loaned to Spanish club CD M\u00e1laga, where he would score seven goals in the season of 1985\u20131986. He was then sold to Chilean club Colo-Colo. He immediately showed his good football once again. In 1988, he was sold for, at the time, a record amount to Italian side Bologna. The profits Colo-Colo received for Rubio helped finish the construction of their current stadium, Estadio Monumental David Arellano. He scored two goals in five games played in the Coppa Italia. He played in 20 Serie A games before devastatingly injuring himself against Napoli, which kept him out of football for five months. In 1989, he was loaned to FC St. Gallen, where fellow Chilean Ivan Zamorano played. He would stay in Switzerland until 1991. Rubio returned to Chile to play for Colo-Colo, where he would win the Recopa Sudamericana and Copa Interamericana in 1991. His second stay would last until 1994 when he moved to Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. He scored seven goals in the lone season he played for Uni\u00f3n. His third stop with Colo-Colo would lead to his retirement in 1997."

He had further appearances with the reserve side including a match where a clearance from the field went right into the front window of his car in the parking lot, smashing it.

In the 2002 season, Li was promoted to the first team and made his debut on 1 September 2002 in a 4-1 loss against Beijing Guoan. After several seasons as the backup goalkeeper, Li would start to rise to prominence by playing in 23 league games during the 2005 season as he established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper. The following season for Li was to prove unsuccessful with Qingdao as they flirted with relegation. He also found himself playing a significantly smaller role within the team by playing in only thirteen games within the season. At the start of the 2007 season, Li transferred to second tier side Guangzhou GPC. After only one season with the team, he quickly established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper and saw Guangzhou immediately promoted to the top tier after winning the second tier title. Within the top tier again, Li would make sure the club were midtable regulars for the next several seasons until the club were relegated for match-fixing at the end of the 2009 season which occurred in 2006 before he joined the club. Despite this, Li remained loyal towards the club and he went on to make his 100th appearance for Guangzhou on 18 September 2010 in a 2-1 win against Yanbian FC. He became the club's second-choice goalkeeper after June 2011. He was linked with fellow Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua at the end of the 2014 season; however, he decided to stay in Guangzhou and signed a one-year extension with an option to a second year with the club on 19 November 2014. On 19 January 2016, Li transferred to Shanghai Shenhua. He made his debut for the club on 5 March 2016 in a 1-1 draw against Yanbian Fude.

        "content": "Angela Maxwell began skating at age six. She first performed a backflip on ice at age nine. In the 2003\u201304 season, Maxwell won the Southwestern Regional Championships on the juvenile level to qualify for the 2004 U.S. Junior Championships, which are the national championships in the United States for juvenile and intermediate level skaters. She placed 11th at the 2004 Junior Nationals. The following season, she moved up to the intermediate level. She won the silver medal at the 2005 Southwestern Regionals and qualified for the 2005 U.S. Junior Championships. She placed fourth at that competition and won the pewter medal. In the 2005\u201306 season, Maxwell moved up to the novice level. She won the silver medal at the 2006 Southwestern Regionals behind Alexe Gilles and qualified for the 2006 Midwestern Sectional Championships. She won the silver medal at that competition behind Rhiana Brammeier, which qualified her for the 2006 U.S. Championships. At the 2006 Nationals, Maxwell placed 11th. She was coached by Cheryl Pascarelli. Maxwell made a coaching change and remained on the novice level in the 2006\u201307 season. She won both her regional and sectional competitions to qualify for the 2007 U.S. Championships. She won the national novice title and was invited to skate in the exhibition gala. Maxwell performed an exhibition to the music of Jock Jams and performed two backflips on the ice. She was coached by Alexey Letov. After Nationals, she competed at the International Challenge Cup on the novice level and won the competition. It was her first international competition. In the 2007\u201308 season, Maxwell moved up to the junior level and was coached by Natalia Mishkutenok. She won the bronze medal at the 2007\u201308 ISU Junior Grand Prix event in Lake Placid, New York, which was the first event of the series, and performed a backflip on the ice on her way to accepting the medal. She was part of a US sweep at that competition of the ladies podium along with gold medalist Mirai Nagasu and silver medalist Alexe Gilles. Although her medal put her in a position to potentially qualify for the 2007\u201308 JGP Final, she did not receive a second assignment. Because she did not qualify for the Final, Maxwell had to qualify for the 2008 U.S. Championships through regionals and sectionals. She won the silver medal at the Southwestern Regionals on the junior level behind Chaochih Liu. She won the Midwestern Sectionals. At Nationals, Maxwell won the silver medal behind Alexe Gilles. Maxwell was the second alternate to the 2008 World Junior Championships. Ahead of the 2008\u201309 season, Maxwell relocated from Dallas, Texas, to Hackensack, New Jersey, where she chose Olga Orlova as her new coach. She began her season at the 2008\u201309 ISU Junior Grand Prix event in Ostrava, Czech Republic, and won the silver medal. She then competed at the JGP event in Sheffield in England, where she took the bronze. She, thus, qualified for the JGP Final, where she finished 5th overall. She competed for the first time as a senior at the 2009 U.S. Championships, where she finished in 8th place. In the 2009\u201310 ISU Junior Grand Prix series, Maxwell won silver medals in Hungary and Germany, earning qualification to her second JGP Final, where she finished 6th."

Mar\u00edtimo, appearing in 14 league games for a final 13th position. He spent three of the following four seasons also in the top division, in representation of Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra and C.F. Uni\u00e3o. In 1991, about one year after the club lost Z\u00e9 Beto in a car accident, FC Porto bought Valente to act as backup to future club legend V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda, and he ended up playing only two matches in his two year-spell at the Est\u00e1dio das Antas, totalling 13 minutes in two substitute appearances. He met the same fate at his next team, Boavista FC. After three seasons with C.F. Os Belenenses , the 32-year-old Valente signed for F.C. Alverca of the same tier, being understudy to Paulo Santos. He then returned to former side Acad\u00e9mica, who now competed in the Segunda Liga. Valente retired from football at the age of 39, after one year apiece with amateurs Imortal D.C. and F.C. Pampilhosa. Subsequently, he worked as a goalkeeper coach at U.D. Leiria and the Burkina Faso, Gabon national teams and CS Sfaxien, always under compatriot Paulo Duarte."

He began to play regularly for the club's youth setup in 2005 after a brief spell at Chelsea. White featured in the FA Youth Cup semi-final in 2005\u201306, as well as the Academy League play-offs where he scored the opener after coming off the bench against Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final to set Saints on their way to the Championship. He was the winner of the 2006\u201307 Academy Player of the Year award, but had to accept his prize on crutches, after suffering a cruciate injury whilst training with the first team in March 2007. Despite his injury, White was still able to claim that season's top scorer prize for the Under 18s side and made a full recovery in 2007\u201308. Following a strong pre-season, White was named on the bench for the League Cup tie against Exeter City, and went on to make his first team debut against Derby County on 23 August 2008. On 14 November 2008, he joined Shrewsbury Town on loan for a month, later extended for a second month. It was while at Shrewsbury, White scored his first senior goal in the 2\u20131 home win against Dagenham & Redbridge. Unfortunately, after returning from his loan spell, White broke his leg and dislocated his ankle as the result of a mistimed tackle in a reserve game against Aldershot Town. White joined non-league side Eastleigh on 9 October 2009 on a month-long loan deal from Southampton. He was released by Southampton on 15 May 2010 and signed for Eastleigh on 21 December 2010 on a non-contract basis. In January 2011, he signed a short-term contract with local club Totton & Eling. Later on in 2011, White signed for Queensland State League side Whitsunday Miners. He played 36 matches and scored 9 goals. For the 2011\u20132012 season he signed with Wessex Premier side Winchester City, he ended up one goal short of equalling the record number of goals in the Wessex League in a season as Winchester won the division."

Salisbury had been trying to sign White for about 5 or 6 months before they eventually got hold of him. The big difference between leagues didn't seem to prevent White from playing at his best as he featured in almost all of Salisbury's league matches, and scored 26 goals for them in the league. This included a spectacular volley in Salisbury's play-off final victory against Dover Athletic from just outside the box. He jointly won the golden boot for that season. White later signed a 2-year contract with Salisbury, keeping him with the club until the end of the 2014\u201315 season. In the pre-season period before the 2013\u201314 campaign, White only appeared in one of the fixtures as he required an operation on a hernia. This meant that he would be out for about 6 weeks and would miss the start of the new season. It took longer than expected to get back to match fitness for White, but he eventually made a couple of appearances as a substitute. Unfortunately, White became injured again and so had to take further time out. Despite an injury plagued season, White still managed to score 11 goals in the 2013\u201314 campaign, including 5 goals in the last 5 games of the season."

His family was connected to motor racing: his grandfather competed in the Monte Carlo Rally and his father drove karts, becoming Scottish National Champion. From an early age motorsport was where his interest lay, later listing Formula One World Champions Jim Clark, Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost as his childhood heroes. Coulthard was educated at Kirkcudbright Academy, achieving eight O-grades. Coulthard began karting when his father presented him with his first kart for his eleventh birthday. Having won several local karting championships including the Scottish Junior Kart Championship and the Scottish Kart Championship, Coulthard participated in events further down the UK, including title victory in the Cumbria Kart Racing Club Championship in 1985. Coulthard graded each race he entered on a scale of 1 to 10, with an additional column headlined \"Performance\". He later gave credit to David Leslie, senior and junior for allowing his career to develop. In 1989, Coulthard made the transition from karting to car racing. It is often erroneously claimed that he won the British Formula Ford Championship that season, however this is not the case. Coulthard actually won the lesser P&O Ferries Formula Ford 1600 Junior championship. He became the first recipient of the McLaren/Autosport Young Driver of the Year award, which allowed him to test a McLaren Formula One car. In 1990, Coulthard travelled to Belgium to compete in the EFDA Nations Cup for Great Britain and was partnered with Nicky Hart, where they finished 9th. During the year, Coulthard was selected by Vauxhall Motorsport to race in a one-off appearance in the British Touring Car Championship at Brands Hatch, where he finished 13th. He did not return to the series after suffering a leg injury in a Formula Vauxhall race at Spa-Francorchamps. For 1991, Coulthard signed with Paul Stewart Racing to compete in the British Formula 3 series, taking five victories and finishing second in the Championship behind Rubens Barrichello. Coulthard won the Macau Grand Prix and the Masters of Formula Three. He later traveled to the Fuji Speedway to compete in the annual Formula Three Fuji Cup, taking pole position and finished second behind Jordi Gen\u00e9. In 1992, he moved to the International Formula 3000 series, where he suffered from a lack of competitiveness and finished ninth in the championship. For 1993, Coulthard joined Pacific Racing, taking one victory and finishing third in the series. He entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans alongside John Nielsen and David Brabham for the TWR Jaguar Racing team. The trio won the GT Class, although they were later disqualified for a technical infringement. He moved to the Vortex team in 1994, which received investment from a private investor, allowing Coulthard to drive for the team. In his first and only race for the team held at Silverstone, Coulthard finished third."

A race seat became available after the death of Ayrton Senna in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Coulthard received a telephone call from team principal Frank Williams to test the Williams car at Jerez circuit over four days, causing him to miss a Formula 3000 race at Pau. Making his d\u00e9but in Spain, Coulthard qualified in eighth position, and was set to score a point before his engine failed 34 laps from the finish. He followed this up by scoring his first points with a fifth-place finish in Canada. Williams dropped Coulthard for the following race in France, allowing 1992 Drivers' Champion Nigel Mansell to make a one-off appearance due to pressure from engine supplier Renault. The move strained the relationship between Williams and Coulthard who returned for the British Grand Prix, finishing fifth. For Germany, Williams introduced a revised version of their car, the Williams FW16B. He suffered back to back retirements in the next two races but secured three consecutive points scoring positions\u2014including a podium finish with a second-place in Portugal. Mansell later returned to fill Coulthard's seat for the final three races of the season. Coulthard finished the season in eighth place with Williams first in the Constructors' Championship. For his role, Coulthard was awarded BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year and received an award at the BBC Scottish Sports Personality of the Year. In November, Coulthard became embroiled in a contract dispute. During the Australian Grand Prix, Coulthard chose to leave Williams and signed a contract with McLaren. Williams, however, insisted that they had the right to exercise their option to keep Coulthard, who was on a three-year contract with the team. Coulthard's management argued that the Williams option was not binding. The dispute went to Formula One's Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of Williams on 14 December, forcing Coulthard to stay with the team."

We just have to go forward.\" He endured a torrid start: Coulthard's car suffered from gearbox issues and retired after 35 laps; and in the following race in Malaysia, both cars retired from engine failure after 24 laps.

Max Merkel, coach of Borussia Dortmund at that time, discovered his talent when Konietzka was 20 and included him in the Dortmund squad. Together with fellow striker J\u00fcrgen Sch\u00fctz, he formed the most dangerous attack of the Oberliga West. Konietzka played a total of 100 Bundesliga matches for Borussia Dortmund and TSV 1860 Munich and scored 72 goals, being the second best scorer of the league from 1964\u20131966 in the process. He was also capped nine times for Germany between 1962 and 1965. Despite Konietzka's fine goalscoring record in the German league, German national team manager Sepp Herberger thought of him as too inconsistent, which could be one of the reasons Konietzka never featured regularly for the national side. He won the German championship with Dortmund against 1. FC K\u00f6ln in the last final before the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963. Konietzka earned his place in football history books when he scored the very first goal of the newly founded Bundesliga in the first minute of a match between Werder Bremen and Borussia Dortmund on 24 August 1963 . His biggest successes as a player were a DFB-Pokal title with Dortmund in 1965 and championship titles with Dortmund in 1963 and TSV 1860 Munich in 1966. His coaching career included stints with Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Uerdingen, FC Z\u00fcrich, BSC Young Boys and Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich. He won three Swiss championships with FC Z\u00fcrich between 1974 and 1976 and reached the semi-final of the 1976\u201377 European Cup, where his Z\u00fcrich side was knocked out by English champions Liverpool. As coach of BSC Young Boys he twice reached the final of the Swiss Cup between 1978 and 1980. Konietzka's wife is named Claudia. He took Swiss citizenship in 1988. With help of euthanasia-organisation Exit International, he chose to end his life at the age of 73 in Brunnen, Canton of Schwyz. He had been suffering from cancer prior to his death on 12 March 2012."

Despite being a prolific scorer in the reserve team, Parsons never managed to hold down a regular place in the first team due to the wealth of striking talent in the likes of Brian Clark, John Toshack and Alan Warboys and, in February 1973, left to join Bournemouth. His time at Bournemouth was severely hampered by injuries and he had made just 8 league appearances when he returned to Wales to sign for Newport County in March 1975. His spell at Newport was his most successful spell in The Football League, spending two seasons as a regular in the side before moving into non-league football."

It refers to a series of allegations made by a Massillon, Ohio newspaper charging the Canton Bulldogs coach, Blondy Wallace, and Massillon Tigers end, Walter East, of conspiring to fix a two-game series between the two clubs. One account of the scandal called for Canton to win the first game and Massillon was to win the second, forcing a third game\u2014with the biggest gate\u2014to be played legitimately, with the 1906 Ohio League championship at stake. Another account accused Wallace and East of bribing Massillon players to throw a game in the series. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to damage the club's reputation. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the second game and it remains unknown if there was ever a match-fixing agreement, the scandal tarnished the Bulldogs name and reportedly helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid-1910s."

Located just 15 miles apart in Stark County, both teams were constantly fighting to recruit the best players in football. In fact the Bulldogs, or Canton Athletic Club as they were called at the time, formed their football team in 1905 with the sole objective of beating the Tigers, who had won every Ohio League championship since 1903. Both teams spent lavish amounts of money to bring in ringers from out-of-town. The very first Canton-Massillon game was played on November 30, 1905. The game was the season finale for both clubs. Up until that finale game, Massillon had posted an 8\u20130 record, while Canton posted an 8\u20131 record, with only a 6\u20130 loss against the Latrobe Athletic Association from Pennsylvania. Massillon went on to win the game 14\u20134. The victory brought the Tigers the Ohio League championship for the third consecutive season."

The club denied the allegation and insisted that every dollar promised had indeed been delivered. Many Canton followers believed the story had originated in Massillon as a trick to discredit their team and make it tougher for Canton to recruit players for 1906. Massillon coach, Ed Stewart, who had newspaper connections, was believed by Canton to have planted the story. However, while Canton was in fact losing money in 1905, a group of area businessmen shouldered the losses. In a counter-charge, Canton insisted that the Tigers were also deeply in debt. However, a statement by the Tigers showed $16,037.90 in receipts and only $16,015.65 in expenditures. The only problem with Massillon's figures was that they only listed salaries, including railroad fare, at $6,740.95, which means the players were getting only about $50 per game. However, it is believed, like with Canton, that Massillon's area boosters picked up whatever losses the Tigers incurred during 1905."

        "content": "An earlier agreement between the two clubs called for each home team to receive 60 percent of the gate admission and reserved seating rights. However, Massillon disliked the deal because Canton would receive more money for the games, since their stadium was larger, and the game at Canton would be played in October, instead of the November weather to be seen in Massillon. This led the Tigers to ask that the game, to be held in Massillon, be played on Thanksgiving Day, when every football fan would attend regardless of the weather. However that October, Wallace traveled to Pennsylvania to recruit players for the upcoming game against Massillon. There he scheduled a Thanksgiving Day game against the Latrobe Athletic Association, who was the top team in Pennsylvania, and one of the toughest squads in the country. The Latrobe squad featured star quarterback John Brallier, and dealt Canton a defeat in 1905. Finally, the teams agreed to play two games of football against other in November and share equally the gate receipts. The Canton home game was slated for Friday, November 16; while the Massillon home game come on Saturday, November 24, the weekend before Thanksgiving. However, many Tigers followers felt that the scheduling of the Canton-Latrobe game was only a ploy to get Massillon to agree to lesser terms. Therefore, language was added to the agreement that if Massillon did anything to disrupt the Canton-Latrobe game, they would lose all of their gate money from their first game at Canton to the Bulldogs. The money from the November 16 was held in escrow in a Canton bank. To ensure that the Thanksgiving Day game between Latrobe and Canton was legitimate, the gate money from the second Bulldogs-Tigers was also kept on hold, this time at Merchants' National Bank in Massillon. If the Canton-Latrobe game never occurred, then Massillon would be entitled to all of Canton's gate money from the second Canton-Massillon game. Each team was also required to put up a $3,000 bond, as insurance that each team would show on the game days."

However, Massillon's Ed Stewart stated that it would be impossible to fix the coming game, stating that an entire team, not just certain players would have to be involved. \"Big Bill\" Edwards, a former player from Princeton officiated the game, and kept both teams in check. However things became more heated for second game. The Tigers vowed to defeat Canton with their same roster from November 16, while Bell Telephone again announced it would telegraph a play-by-play account of the second game. The only roster change occurred when the Bulldogs signed Eddie Wood, a regular end from the Latrobe Athletic Association, to play in the rematch for an injured player named Gilchrist. Meanwhile, Stewart announced that \"Big Bill\" Edwards would be unavailable to referee because he'd be officiating that year's Yale-Harvard game. Edward Whiting of Cornell University, who'd umpired the first game at Canton, agreed to bring a replacement referee with him. Prior to the start of the game, a disagreement over which ball to use occurred. Massillon showed up with a ball, several ounces lighter than the Spalding brand ball Canton was used to. Blondy Wallace protested that ball made by Spalding was the norm, however, Massillon was adamant about keeping the lighter ball, which was provided to the Tigers by Ed Stewart. Wallace's protest fell on deaf ears, and was told by game's officials that he could either accept the lighter ball or forfeit both the game and the $3,000 guarantee. Historians believe that reason for Massillon's insistence for lighter ball was to help their kicking game. The Bulldogs, coming off of their 10\u20135 win a week ago, was favored to win the game. However, Massillon outplayed Canton and won the rematch 13\u20136 and was named the Ohio League's 1906 champions for the fourth straight year."

However, the evening after the second game at the Courtland Hotel Bar, a brawl erupted among several of the Canton players and fans over allegations that the game had been fixed. Jack Cusack, who would become the owner and manager of the Canton Bulldogs from 1912 until 1915, wrote in his book Pioneer in Pro Football that the fight was started by Cusack's neighbor, Victor Kaufmann, a physician who suffered heavy betting losses on the disputed contest. Cusack stated that he went with Kaufmann to the Courtland Hotel Bar, where Kaufman loudly made allegations of a fix. A large bar fight started in the hotel's bar area and quickly spread onto the street. Police were then called to break-up the disturbance, but Cusack and Kaufmann reportedly avoided arrest. Meanwhile, Massillon's Ed Stewart, through his newspaper Massillon Independent, charged that an actual attempt was made to bribe some of the Tiger players into throwing the game and that Blondy Wallace had been involved. One story suggested that Canton players had bet large amounts of money on themselves to win, while approaching the Massillon players and asking them to throw the game in exchange for a share of Canton's winnings. Some Canton followers then wondered if Wallace threw the game to Massillon in order to collect on some of the game's wagers. At first the play-calling strategy of Wallace was the focus of suspicion, but as the scandal grew, a number of contradictory allegations came out. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to ruin the club's reputation before their final game against the Latrobe Athletic Association on Thanksgiving Day. Canton's counter-charge was that the scandal was designed by the Tigers to cripple the Bulldogs financially by destroying the gate revenue for the Latrobe game. Massillon could not prove the charge, however, the stands were almost empty for the Thanksgiving Day Latrobe-Canton game, leaving Canton unable to pay their players."

March was a former player at Mount Union College, an executive for the New York Giants from 1925 to 1936 and later an organizer of the second American Football League. However, March also practiced medicine in Canton in 1906 and was named one of the Bulldogs team doctors. Of the incident, March stated that Wallace persuaded an unnamed Canton player to deliberately throw the game. When accused by his teammates, this player said he had simply obeyed orders. The player then quickly left town, on the first available train, while still in his uniform. The Professional Football Researchers Association has identified this player, as Eddie Wood of Latrobe. March gave the impression that he was running for his life from angry fans and teammates. However, even before the second Canton-Massillon game began, it was announced that Wood would be on the first train back to Latrobe, once the game ended. Not to mention that when Wood returned on the following Thursday with the Latrobe team, he was not attacked by the fans or his ex-Canton teammates. Also Wood scored the Bulldogs only score of the game. As for following Wallace's orders, Wood often crashed the middle of the field on defense, allowing the Tigers to escape outside. However, Massillon was historically known for running up the middle of field."

According to East, Wightman had first asked him to solicit Maxwell and Shiring and have them throw the game, he then had East find a backer who would pay Wightman $4,000. However Wightman backed out of the deal at the last minute. He later went on to add that no member of the Bulldogs or their backers, as far as he knew, were connected with the deal. He finally stated that the only reason that Stewart went public on scandal was to ruin the attendance for the Canton-Latrobe game. East then gave the Akron Beacon-Journal a copy of a contract in which Wightman agreed to have the first Canton-Massillon game thrown for $4,000. The contract was signed by East, Wightman and John T. Windsor, one of the owners of East's Akron baseball team. Windsor admitted to his part in the scheme, backing up East's story. He said that he never even met Wallace. In an interview to The Plain Dealer, Wightman stated that the contract signed by himself, East and Windsor was done in accordance with instruction from Ed Stewart and the backers of the Massillon team. He stated that he reported East's scheme to Stewart, and was told to go along with deal to see which Massillon players would agree to throwing the game and then remove them from the team. He then stated that he kept up the act until he had the signatures of East and Windsor down on paper. Only then was East released from the team. Stewart defended the coach, agreeing that Wightman had entered into the contract with East and Windsor at the behest of the Tiger backers in order to get the goods on the fixers. Back in Akron, Walter East was seen as being the hapless victim of a crooked team. He was retained as manager of the Akron baseball team for the 1907 season. However, he was later fired after the team began losing."

Canton blamed the scandal for the small crowd, however, some believe that once the Bulldogs lost to Massillon, many fans lost interest in football. Therefore, regardless of a scandal, the game's attendance still would have fallen well below expectations. Canton players were not paid as a result, in addition. To help pay for the Latrobe team's expenses an effort was established in Latrobe, which raised part of the team's $300 expense debt, and the balance of the money was borrowed by the YMCA so that it could be paid. Meanwhile, the Tigers traveled to Chicago to beat the \"All-Western\" team. The attendance for that game was a mere 2,000 spectators. The timing of the betting scandal being made public damaged Canton far more than Massillon. Many allegations stated that Canton threw the second game of series, however, if the story had broken after Massillon's earlier loss to Canton, the Tigers would have been more damaged. However, the scandal engulfed both teams and forced them to fold. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the game, it so tarnished Canton's name that virtually no one attended the Latrobe game. The Bulldogs, including Wallace, were now broke. A story by the Pittsburgh Post estimated that team still owed its players $6,000 for the 1906 season. A benefit game between Massillon and Canton to help pay the Bulldog players only drew 500 fans and resulted in a 5\u20135 tie. The proceeds from the game was only enough to get the remaining Canton players a train ticket home."

However, the argument can be made that the expense of placing all-star teams on the field each week, also put a hamper on the sport. The Canton Morning News put a $20,000 price tag on the Massillon Tigers 1906 team, while many speculate that the cost of the Bulldogs probably even higher. Still others contend that the games involving top teams like Canton and Massilon were too one-sided and lacked excitement. Many towns in Ohio still fielded clubs over the next several years, and these new pros were consisted more of hometown talent, with only the occasional ringer. Peggy Parratt, Massillon's quarterback, stayed in Massillon for the 1907 season, but he then began moving from team to team in the region, racking up Ohio League titles on a nearly annual basis. A second incarnation of the Bulldogs would be established in 1911 and would later go to win two championships in the National Football League. The diminished stature of Ohio pro football led to other areas of the country building top professional teams, including the Washington Vigilants."

His second goal for Banfield came on 26 September, when he scored with a strike into the top corner from outside of the area in an important 2\u20131 win against Newell's Old Boys, a victory that helped Banfield win the Argentine championship for the first time in the club's history. In December 2009, Italian club Udinese planned to make a bid for James for a reported \u20ac5\u00a0million after the 2010 Copa Libertadores. However, Banfield rejected the bid, labelling it as \"insufficient\". For the Clausura 2010, on 13 February 2010, James scored a golazo in the match against archrivals Lan\u00fas with a left-footed lob to make the game 2\u20130 in the final minutes. After the game, daily sports website Diario Ol\u00e9 compared his playing and personal style to Cristiano Ronaldo and nicknamed him the \"James Bond of Banfield\"."

Since fellow Colombians Radamel Falcao, Fredy Guar\u00edn and Brazilian Hulk left the club during the last two seasons, James was able to start more regularly than before. In a match against Olhanense on 1 September, James scored a chip from a tight angle. In the same game, he assisted compatriot Jackson Mart\u00ednez with a through ball for an eventual 3\u20132 win.

In the Champions League against Dinamo Kyiv on 24 October, he assisted Jackson Mart\u00ednez to an eventual 3\u20132 home victory. James scored Porto's last two goals in a 5\u20130 win over Mar\u00edtimo on 2 November. In the 90th minute against Braga, James scored a goal in an eventual 2\u20130 away victory. Prior to the second half of the season, James suffered a hamstring injury causing him to struggle to maintain fitness. In a match against Nacional on 5 January, he injured his hamstring once more and was subsequently substituted after the first half. The injury sidelined him for a month. On 1 February 2013, Porto bought back 35% economic rights of James from Gol Football Luxembourg for \u20ac8.75\u00a0million , which Porto sold in November 2010 for \u20ac2.5\u00a0million. James made his return at the 70th minute in the 2\u20130 victory over Beira-Mar on 23 February, his first match since being injured for more than a month. In his second league match since his return, James assisted a goal against Rio Ave with a wonderful cross. On 8 March, he assisted a goal against Estoril from a corner in a 2\u20130 victory. It was James' first start in two months. James did not start in the second leg of the Champions League match against M\u00e1laga until the second half when Porto was down to ten men after the dismiss of a defender.

James expressed his disappointment, claiming to be \"100%\" in good health . However, he also expressed his respect and understanding to the coach's concern. Despite an exit from the Champions League, James went on to become the second-most fouled player in the tournament that year. Manchester United reportedly made a bid for \u20ac30\u00a0million to purchase James, though Porto rejected the offer as being too low. James scored his first Ta\u00e7a da Liga goal, a penalty, in the 2012\u201313 Ta\u00e7a da Liga semi-final against Rio Ave. Porto won the match 4\u20130 and advanced to the final.

Days later, he assisted another goal in a 3\u20131 home victory against Ecuador. In early August, he contributed both a goal and an assist in Colombia's 2\u20130 victory against Venezuela. Starting off 2017, James scored a late dramatic goal against a defensive Bolivia after missing an earlier penalty. The 1\u20130 home victory allowed Colombia to move to 4th place within the qualification group. Days later, James would score and provide a goal in an impressive 0\u20132 victory in Ecuador. For his first friendly of the year, James assisted Radamel Falcao's goal from the corner against European giants Spain. The game would end 2\u20132. Days later against Cameroon, James would both provide and score a goal in a dominating 4\u20130 victory. For the last qualification match of the 2018 World Cup, James would score a crucial away goal against South American rival Peru, resulting in a 1\u20131 draw and granting Colombia the last automatic qualification spot at fourth place. James' last contribution of 2017 for Colombia would be an assist against South Korea, which would end 2\u20131. Colombia's World Cup preparations in 2018 began against World Cup favorites France, where James provided two assists towards a comeback of a 2\u20130 score to a 2\u20133 victory.

        "content": "Once considered to be among the best young players in the world, James is a versatile footballer who can play in several positions across the midfield or front-line, having played as a playmaker, winger, and central midfielder for both club and country, although he has stated in interviews that his preferred role is as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers. Praised for his pace, technical skills, vision, and his ability to create chances for teammates as an advanced playmaker, James' performances as a classic number 10 have led to comparisons with the famous Colombian footballer Carlos Valderrama; Valderrama himself declared James as his \"successor\". Although naturally left-footed, James has shown ambidexterity in his dribbling and style of play. His goal scoring abilities were a highlight of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where he managed to claim the Golden Boot despite Colombia's elimination in the quarter finals following a 2\u20131 loss to Brazil. He is also an accurate free kick taker, and a goal threat from anywhere on the pitch. This has made James recognized for his unpredictability as noted by Marca writer Justin Sherman: \"One of the differences that James has with other players is that, apart from being very good outside the area, he is also good inside. He has the qualities of a No. 9 and is capable of finishing with a shot from the head or with either foot with great effectiveness.\""

After graduating in 1970 Wilkinson taught high school for a year before returning to Canton as an assistant coach for his alma mater. Wilkinson served as an assistant for St. Lawrence for seven years, leaving to accept a similar position at North Dakota for one season. He spent a further three seasons as an assistant at Bowling Green under Jerry York before getting his first head coaching job at Western Michigan. After a poor showing in his first year the Broncos produced their first 20+ win season at the D-I level, earning Wilkinson the CCHA Coach of the Year. Two years later Wilkinson got the Broncos to surprising 32-win season, the program's only 30-win season , won the CCHA Tournament and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time. The team declined to a mediocre level for much of the next seven years before finally returning to the NCAA tournament in 1994. The Broncos made another trip to the playoffs two years later but remained winless in NCAA postseason play under Wilkinson. During the 1998\u201399 season two of Wilkinson's players were arrested at a team party in a building that Wilkinson owned. An internal investigation was started and the entire team was subsequently suspended for violations of NCAA regulations. Wilkinson was eventually fired as head coach on February 3 but allowed to remain at the university as a special assistant to the AD. Once the season was over Wilkinson formally left and later took over as head coach for the newly-created program at Wayne State. The Warriors played as an independent for one season before joining the CHA. Wayne State produced a modest record their first season in conference but won both of their games in the CHA Tournament to earn Wilkinson his second conference championship. The Warriors followed that up by winning 20 games the next year, winning the CHA regular season title and claiming their second consecutive championship. With all of that team success Wilkinson was awarded with the CHA Coach of the Year. In 2003, with the NCAA tournament expanding to 16 teams, the CHA was to receive its first automatic bid and the two-time champions didn't disappoint, winning 20 games once more and claiming their third consecutive tournament championship. In the tournament Wayne State was set against the #2 overall seed Colorado College and, despite a valiant effort, could not overcome three power play goals from the Tigers. After their three year run the Warriors declined sharply and never produced another winning record. In 2007 the university announced it was shuttering the men's team, citing a $500K annual operating cost coupled with no on-campus rink and a troubled economy. Wilkinson continued to coach after Wayne State shut down, spending three seasons with CH Jaca and then a six-month stint with the Melbourne Mustangs before retiring."

While no name was provided at the Vancouver announcement, over a year later the club confirmed it would keep the Whitecaps name. In preparation for its first MLS season, the Whitecaps brought in executive talent from around the world. On November 24, 2009, Paul Barber, former Tottenham Hotspur F.C. executive, was announced to join the club as CEO. Others joining him included former D.C. United head coach Tom Soehn as Director of Operations and Dutch national Richard Grootscholten as the Technical Director and head coach of the residency program. As the head coach of the USL and later USSF Division 2 Vancouver Whitecaps, former Iceland international Teitur Thordarson was confirmed as head coach on September 2, 2010, for the inaugural MLS season. He was subsequently relieved of his duties on May 30, 2011, after the Whitecaps won just one of their first twelve matches. Tom Soehn, the Whitecaps director of soccer operations, replaced Thordarson on an interim basis. The Whitecaps began play in the 2011 MLS season with their first match on March 19, 2011, against rival Canadians Toronto FC, which they won 4\u20132. The first goal in the Whitecaps' MLS era was scored by Eric Hassli. After their winning start the Whitecaps struggled, and failed to secure another victory in their next 11 MLS games, drawing six and losing five. In the aftermath of their 1\u20131 draw with the New York Red Bulls on May 30 head coach Teitur Thordarson was fired. Tom Soehn took over coaching duties for the remainder of the 2011 season, while Martin Rennie was announced as the new permanent head coach on August 9, taking over officially on November 2. On March 3, 2012, the Whitecaps won their first minor, pre-season cup at the 2012 Walt Disney World Pro Soccer Classic defeating Toronto FC 1\u20130 thanks to a goal by Camilo Sanvezzo. The Whitecaps finished the regular season with 11 wins, 3 losses, and 10 ties positioning the club, 5th in the Western Conference and 11th on the league overall table. On October 21, 2012, the Whitecaps became the first Canadian team to earn a spot in the MLS playoffs. Vancouver were eliminated in the knockout round. In the 2013 season, Vancouver finished in 7th in the Western Conference, 13th in the league table with 13 wins, 12 losses, and 9 ties in the regular season. They were not able to qualify for the post season, in the playoffs as they had accomplished in the season prior. Two days after the end of the 2013 MLS regular season, Rennie's contract was not renewed sparking a search for the next head coach. In their off-season, the Whitecaps were in the midst of controversy with one of their then players, Camilo, who had played for the team since their inaugural campaign, after the Brazilian went on to join Liga MX club Quer\u00e9taro.  The Mexican club believed that he was no longer under contract, while the Whitecaps reported that he was still on a contract with Vancouver. The scandal was resolved with the Liga MX club paying a transfer fee from Vancouver to acquire the Brazilian forward. In October 2014, the Whitecaps qualified for the 2015\u201316 CONCACAF Champions League for the very first time as a result of becoming the highest ranked Canadian team in the 2014 MLS season and due to a reformatting of the Canadian Championship in the following season. A week later they qualified for the MLS playoffs for the second time, an achievement unmatched by any Canadian team."

The name alludes to the geographic features surrounding the city: snow-capped mountains to the north and the Pacific Ocean's white-capped waves to the west. The official club colours include navy blue , white, and light blue . The \"deep sea\" blue represents the maritime landscape of the Vancouver area and the \"Whitecaps blue\" indicates the reflection of the North Shore Mountains in the Pacific Ocean. The lighter shade of blue also alludes to the primary colour of the original Whitecaps, winners of Soccer Bowl 1979. The silver outline pays homage to the team's championship victories since 1974. On June 10, 2010, the Whitecaps strip package was unveiled with Bell Canada serving as the inaugural jersey sponsor. The home shirt is white with horizontal, navy blue pinstripes; the stripes broaden slightly from bottom to top. The secondary shirt is deep blue with an embossed, interlocking diamond pattern which is also deep blue and is reflective in the light. On June 14, 2012, the Whitecaps unveiled a third kit. The third kit is predominantly \"arbutus brown\", with sky blue accents, which reflects the unique land full of deep roots and the high-reaching arms of the temperate rainforests of British Columbia. In 2019 they used a redesigned version of their 1979 kit as a 40th anniversary tribute to the team winning the 1979 NASL Soccer Bowl."

Vancouver has played at BC Place since the final month of the 2011 MLS season, having spent the majority of that year at Empire Field. BC Place is a 54,500-seat multi-purpose stadium designed for both Canadian football and soccer. The stadium opened in 1983, but underwent a complete two-phase revitalization project between 2009 and 2011. The stadium now features the largest cable-supported retractable roof in the world and polytan artificial turf, which is certified by FIFA with a 2-star rating. The Whitecaps reduce the stadium's capacity to 22,120 for matches by using white sails to close off the upper bowl. Club ownership initially hoped to build Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium in Gastown in time for the 2016 season, but the club has committed to BC Place in light of stadium opposition. The club played most of its inaugural season at Empire Field, a temporary stadium built at the former site of Empire Stadium to house the Whitecaps and the BC Lions while BC Place was being renovated. Empire Field was a 27,500-seat multi-purpose stadium that featured FIFA 1-star rated FieldTurf. The team played its final match at Empire Field on September 24, 2011, a 3\u20131 loss to Seattle Sounders FC. The following week, the Whitecaps played their first match at BC Place, a 1\u20130 loss to Portland Timbers on October 2, 2011. The club does not have a permanent training facility, opting instead to use facilities around Greater Vancouver. However, the club partnered with the Government of British Columbia and the University of British Columbia to build a $32.5 million National Soccer Development Centre on the UBC campus, which opened on September 22, 2017. Near the end of the 2020 and at the beginning of the 2021 seasons, the club was forced to play their home matches in the United States due to the Canadian government's response to limit cross-border travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. The club shared facilities with Portland Timbers Providence Park in Portland, Oregon where they would play one of their rivalry matches as the home team. In 2021, the club would play most of their home matches at Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah since the start of the season."

        "title": "Vancouver Whitecaps FC_Supporters",
        "content": "The largest Whitecaps supporters group is known as the Southsiders. The group began in 1999 when fans of the Vancouver 86ers began congregating in the pitch-level beer garden behind the goal at the south end of Swangard Stadium. The Southsiders' relationship with the team's ownership has not always been amicable. It has evolved since Vancouver received the MLS expansion team. Images of the Southsiders are featured prominently in Whitecaps' marketing campaigns. The group's board was invited to the invite-only launch of the kits and logo to be used in MLS. The expansion has also increased membership to over 1200. The president of the organization said that it had grown from about 40 paid members to 100 paid in July 2010. He also believes there is no reason why the Southsiders cannot outdo the Seattle Sounders' Emerald City Supporters. Southsider supporters were primarily located in the southeast corner of B.C. Place stadium. The majority of the group has relocated to the new general admission section at BC Place in half of section 253 and all of section 254 that was introduced for the 2020 MLS season. The three biggest supporter groups are the Vancouver Southhsiders, Curva Collective and the Rain City Brigade. There are several sub-groups that have emerged, members of which are sometimes also members of the three larger groups. Founded after the 2011 season, Curva Collective is a movement of like-minded supporters joined in their passion and support of Vancouver Whitecaps FC and its players. What unites them is a love for the \u2018Caps. The group works collectively to support in meaningful and quality ways because \"we know together we can achieve more than on our own\". Their motto's are: We are who we are, Giving our all and Support is always. With a focus on visual displays and vocal unity in half of section 253 and all of section 254, the new supporters general admissions section at BC Place. Curva Collective was previously located in sections 203 and 204 or the southwest curva. Rain City Brigade was established in 2010 when a group of friends, who all followed the Whitecaps, decided to get together and create a group to formally support the team in a way that was true to them. What started out as a way for a couple of friends to hang out, drink beer and watch the sport we all love, soon became the social events that many look forward to every Whitecaps game day. They are passionate supporters from all walks of life, and from all corners of the world, ready to give their all for the full 90+ minutes to support the Whitecaps, win, lose or draw. The group quickly attracted like-minded individuals and after a few seasons plus a couple of different stadiums, the group has grown to almost two-hundred members over the past three years. The Rain City Brigade has a block of about 225 season tickets for their members in section 201 and marches from Library Square. The Prawnsiders have existed since the Whitecaps' Swangard years, but organized formally at the beginning of the inaugural MLS season in 2011. The name \"Prawnsiders\" comes from \"prawn-sandwich brigade\", a term often used to describe soccer supporters who sit in the more expensive seats. The Prawnsiders formed because they wanted to create an equally enthusiastic supporter experience for those fans who didn't want to be behind the nets. They are primarily located in sections 244 and 245. South Sisters provide a positive meeting space for Vancouver Whitecaps supporters who identify as female, LGBTQ2+, or allies. The  group was officially formed in 2019. They show that soccer supporters come in all shapes and sizes and that big hearts bring loud voices, and loud voices are what our players need to get a goal and win games. South Sisters are an inclusive group so any Whitecaps supporters can partake in our kind of support regardless of where they sit, how many games they attend, or if they are a Prawnsider, Casual, Southsider, Kevinsider, Curva, RCB, Couch Ultra, Pigeon Casual etc. Their mandate is to support the players and fans, on and off the pitch. Goal: We are here to be change makers in the systemic treatment of people who identify as female and LGBTQ2+ in the soccer community through thoughtful conversation and education. Couch Ultras were officially formed in 2017. Their group's name comes from the fact that they started supporting the Whitecaps from the couch. They set-up their basement with banners and tifos for away games to best create the game day atmosphere from home. The group makes use of a tifo rigging system in their basement to uniquely display their tifo's. Couch Ultras are active at BC Place for home Whitecaps games as well. The group has done various small scale tifo displays at BC Place. Couch Ultras also support both the Canadian Men's and Women's National Soccer Team. Vancouver Albion is the newest out of the supporters groups. The group's name comes from when a group of friends, aged 14, decided to create a club on the video game FIFA 20. There was little names available, so Vancouver Albion was selected. It was then pointed out that Albion, refers to a group of people in UK, deeming the name to make no sense for a group of Vancouverites. From then on, it became an inside joke, and the name stuck. When these same friends decided to start a supporters group together, there was only one name that it could be. They are the only entirely youth supporters group, and have expanded to 15 members in just their first season at BC Place. They sit in Section 254. In 2020, a new general admissions supporters section was introduced in half of Section 253 and all of Section 254, right beside the tunnel where the players enter the pitch. You don't need to be a member of a supporter group to be in the section and seating is unassigned, so you can stand where you want, with who you want. The majority of the Vancouver Southsiders and Curva Collective are located here. Standing and chanting are permitted throughout the match in this' section. The team sold the first 5,000 $50 season ticket deposits 48 hours after they became available to the public. Remaining season tickets were made available to season ticket holders for the USSF 2 Whitecaps before becoming available to non-season ticket holders. The team managed to attract 15,500 season ticket holders in its first MLS season and 13,000 for the second. Former Group: \"La Doce\", formed in January 2011. Their original name in Spanish is \"La 12\", which can be translated into English as \"The 12th\" or \"The 12th player\". La 12 is formed by people from different nationalities that have a preference to support the Whitecaps in a Latin American, Southern European or Eastern European Style. The main feature of La 12 is its cheering style that features constant drumming and longer songs, resembling the way in which fans in South America or Southern or Eastern Europe like to support. La 12 fans were primarily seated in the southeast corner of Empire Field. The group has since folded after the 2011 season with many members joining Curva Collective. Many Whitecaps supporters have friendly relationships with the Timbers Army away from the game, but a fierce rivalry at match time. This has stemmed from a mutual animosity with supporters of the Seattle Sounders in the three-way Cascadia Cup. There is also a friendship with Grimsby Town supporters owing to a mix-up of hashtags on twitter in 2015 and the player Trevor Whymark, who has played for both teams."

The two clubs played for the 100th time in 2017, and the rivalry is one of the most-played in US soccer history."

Kerfoot has been the majority owner of the Whitecaps since 2002, when he saved the club from contraction after previous owner David Stadnyk left the club, selling it to United Soccer Leagues. He was previously the chairman and chief executive officer of Crystal Decisions. Mallett, a former chief operating officer of Yahoo!, who was raised in Victoria, British Columbia, has a significant background in soccer. He played for the British Columbia under-16 provincial team and was on the University of Victoria Vikes squad that lost in the final of the 1982 CIS Men's Soccer Championship. He also spent one year with the San Francisco State University Gators men's soccer team before an injury left him unable to continue playing competitive soccer. After leaving Yahoo!, Mallett purchased a minority stakes in the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball and English soccer club Derby County F.C. Having first met at a charity soccer event in 2005, Mallett partnered with Steve Nash\u2014a two-time National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player who was also raised in Victoria\u2014to put together a bid for a minority share of English soccer club Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in 2008. After that transaction fell through, the duo contacted Kerfoot about a minority stake in the club. Nash is the older brother of former Whitecaps midfielder Martin Nash. The fourth partner, Steve Luczo, is the president, chairman, and CEO of Seagate Technology and a partner in Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., a group who own the NBA Boston Celtics. Luczo met Kerfoot while the two were both employed by Seagate Technology, and Kerfoot contacted Luczo proposing he become part of the club's MLS bid. In 2009, the group paid a $35 million expansion fee to MLS for the right to join the league."

Harper graduated from high school early so that he could attend the College of Southern Nevada, where he won the 2010 Golden Spikes Award. The Nationals selected Harper as the first overall pick in the 2010 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut with the Nationals on April 28, 2012, at 19 years old. Harper was selected for the 2012 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest position player to perform in an All-Star Game. Harper won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 2012 and tied for the NL lead in home runs in 2015. He was named the NL Most Valuable Player for 2015 by unanimous decision of the Baseball Writers' Association of America; at age 23, he became the youngest MLB baseball player to win the award. As a free agent during the 2018\u201319 offseason, he signed a 13-year, $330\u00a0million contract with the Phillies, the richest contract in the history of North American sports at the time until being eclipsed shortly after by Mike Trout.

        "content": "Harper attended Las Vegas High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. In May 2009, Sports Illustrated featured Harper with a cover story in which he was compared with LeBron James. After his sophomore year, he earned his General Educational Development in October 2009, making him eligible for the Major League Baseball draft held in June 2010, in order to begin his professional baseball career earlier. For the 2010 college season, 17-year-old Harper enrolled at the College of Southern Nevada of the Scenic West Athletic Conference in the National Junior College Athletic Association , where he played as a catcher. His older brother Bryan, who had been his teammate at Las Vegas High School, was one of the Southern Nevada Coyotes' starting pitchers, and the brothers often worked as a battery. An advantage for Harper in his eventual transition to his professional career was that the SWAC, like MLB, uses wooden bats in conference play. In 66 games, he hit 31 home runs with 98 runs batted in , hitting .443 with a .526 on-base percentage , and a .987 slugging percentage . His 31 home runs broke the school's previous record of 12. He was named the 2010 SWAC Player of the Year. In the Western district finals of the 2010 NJCAA World Series, Harper went 6-for-7 with five RBIs and hit for the cycle. The next day, in a doubleheader, he went 2-for-5 with a three-run double in the first game, and in the second game went 6-for-6 with four home runs, a triple, and a double. On June 2 that year, he was ejected from a National Junior College World Series game by home plate umpire Don Gilmore for disputing a called third strike. Harper drew a line in the dirt with his bat as he left the plate, presumably to show where he thought the pitch was. It was Harper's second ejection of the year and resulted in a two-game suspension. The suspension ended his amateur career, as Southern Nevada lost the game from which Harper was ejected and lost their next game with Harper suspended, which eliminated them from the tournament. Harper won the 2010 Golden Spikes Award, given to the best amateur baseball player in the United States."

Although Harper had previously and predominantly played catcher, the Nationals drafted him as an outfielder to extend his career and to accelerate his player development so that he could debut in MLB earlier. At the signing deadline, Harper and the Nationals agreed to a five-year contract worth $9.9\u00a0million, including a $6.25\u00a0million signing bonus and eight semesters of college tuition. When asked about the signing, Nationals President Stan Kasten said, \"The truth is, with a full minute to go, Mike and I both thought we were not going to have a deal.\" Asked what changed in that final minute, Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo replied, \"It was both sides compromising and knowing that we were so close, it would be fruitless not to get a deal done.\" On August 26, 2010, Harper was introduced by the Nationals. He said he chose to wear No. 34 because \"I always loved Mickey Mantle, three and four equals seven.\" After batting .319 with a .407 OBP in the Nationals' fall instructional league, Harper was selected to participate in the Arizona Fall League as a member of the Scottsdale Scorpions taxi-squad, the second-youngest player in the history of the league . He batted .343 and slugged .729. On November 20, Harper and the Scottsdale Scorpions won the 2010 AFL Championship. After batting .399 in spring training, Harper began his minor league career when the Nationals optioned him to the Hagerstown Suns of the Class-A South Atlantic League. In April 2011, after a slow start in the minor leagues, Harper visited optometrist Dr. Keith Smithson, who reportedly told him, \"I don't know how you ever hit before. You have some of the worst eyes I've ever seen.\" In his first 20 games after receiving contact lenses, Harper hit .480, collecting seven home runs, 10 doubles and 23 RBIs. Harper was selected to represent the United States in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game during the 2011 All-Star Game weekend. He was promoted to the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League on July 4. Harper went 2-for-3 in his AA debut with two singles, a run, and a walk. On August 18, 2011, Harper injured his hamstring while running from second to third on an extra-base hit. The injury was severe enough for him to be carried off the field by his coaches. He was placed on the seven-day disabled list and the injury had ended Harper's season. Harper began the 2012 season with the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League."

        "content": "The Nationals promoted Harper to the major leagues on April 27, 2012, after Ryan Zimmerman was placed on the disabled list. He made his MLB debut with the Nationals the next day against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Harper grounded out to pitcher Chad Billingsley in his first major league at-bat. He recorded his first major league hit, a double, in his third at-bat against Billingsley and got his first RBI on a sacrifice fly in the top of the ninth against Javy Guerra. After being hit by a pitch by Cole Hamels in the first inning of a game against the Phillies on May 6, Harper eventually advanced to third, then stole home plate, becoming the first teenager to steal home plate since 1964. Hamels later admitted that he intentionally hit Harper and was suspended for five games by MLB. On May 14, Harper was 19 when he hit his first career Major League home run, connecting off of San Diego Padres pitcher Tim Stauffer. He was the youngest player to homer in the major leagues since Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 did in 1998. He was named National League Rookie of the Month for May. Harper earned his first walkoff hit on June 5 with an RBI single in the bottom of the 12th inning against the New York Mets. During a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 12, Harper hit a deep home run to center field that struck an advertising banner adjacent to the restaurant in the second tier of seats at the Rogers Centre, estimated to travel 438 feet. After the game, a reporter asked if Harper would take advantage of Ontario's lower drinking age by drinking a celebratory beer with his teammates. Harper replied, \"I'm not going to answer that. That's a clown question, bro.\" The comment quickly developed into an Internet meme, and the phrase itself repeated, in response to a question, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Harper filed an application to trademark the phrase. Harper was named a candidate in the All-Star Final Vote, with the winner being added to the All-Star Game roster. Harper finished third behind David Freese and Michael Bourn. However, Bourn would make the roster after Ian Desmond sustained an injury and Harper would become the youngest position player to ever make an All-Star roster when it was announced Giancarlo Stanton would undergo knee surgery. \"I don't have words to explain it right now. It's exciting to go. I'm excited to get there and be around all the top guys in the country, of course, and the top guys in baseball. I'm going to take it all in and try to enjoy it with my family and just be as mellow and as calm as I can,\" Harper stated. He went 0-for-1 with a strikeout and a walk. Harper struggled in the games following the All-Star break, hitting .176 with 26 strikeouts in his first 116 plate appearances in the second half of the season. Manager Davey Johnson began to give Harper days off due to his poor play and visible on-field frustration. Johnson said that Harper had become \"overly aggressive\" at the plate. Harper's play began to improve in late August. He hit two home runs in a game against the Miami Marlins on August 29, his first career multi-homer game, and received his first major league ejection after throwing his helmet down in the ninth inning in response to hitting into a double play. He had a second multi-homer game on September 5, against the Chicago Cubs. Harper was named Rookie of the Month again in September after hitting .330 with seven home runs. Harper's 254 total bases and 57 extra base hits were the most ever for a player under age 20, while his 22 home runs, 98 runs scored, .340 on-base percentage, .477 slugging percentage, and .817 on base-plus-slugging were the best regular season totals for a teenager in the past 45 years. In Game 5 of the 2012 NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals, Harper hit his first postseason home run. The Nationals would eventually lose the game 7\u20139 despite leading by 6 runs. He finished his first postseason appearance with a .130 batting average. Harper was named the National League Rookie of the Year. He received 112 votes, 16 of them first-place votes, beating Arizona's Wade Miley and Cincinnati's Todd Frazier."

Harper returned to the field to celebrate the win with his teammates and was caught shouting profanity towards Knight. Two days later, Harper was given a one-game suspension and an undisclosed fine, but Harper appealed the same day. On May 14, Harper dropped his appeal and began serving the one-game suspension.

His home run was the fifth of his career in a season opener, the most by a player younger than 25. He set the MLB record for runs scored in the month of April with 32, surpassing Larry Walker's 29 in 1997. On May 13, Harper and the Nationals avoided arbitration in 2018 by agreeing to a one-year, $21.625-million contract. That night, he hit a walk-off home run versus the Philadelphia Phillies for the second time in the 2017 season, after doing it on April 16 as well. On May 16, Harper hit a home run at PNC Park, which meant in his career he had hit a home run in all 15 National League ballparks. On May 29, in a game against the San Francisco Giants, Harper was hit by a pitch from Hunter Strickland. Harper had hit two home runs off of Strickland in the 2014 National League Division Series , leading Harper to believe Strickland was seeking revenge. Harper slammed down his bat and charged the mound, throwing his helmet wide of Strickland before the two players exchanged punches, starting a bench-clearing brawl in which Giants first baseman Michael Morse, one of several former Nationals teammates of Harper on the Giants team, suffered a serious concussion in a collision with Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzija. Both Harper and Strickland were ejected for their roles in the brawl. The next day, on May 30, Harper was suspended four games. Harper appealed, and his suspension was reduced to three games. Harper credited Morse with preventing him from injury during the scrum, as Morse had absorbed a body blow from Samardzija that appeared to be aimed at Harper, telling a MASN reporter, \"I'm very thankful for Mikey Mo.\" Harper was the top overall vote-getter for the National League to start in the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and received the most votes of any one player overall. As the starting right fielder for the National League All-Stars, he went 1-for-1 with a walk and made a diving catch to rob American League catcher Salvador P\u00e9rez of a base hit. He wore cleats for the All-Star Game in honor of the late Miami Marlins ace Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez, a division rival pitcher who had held Harper to a career .211 batting average against him; Fern\u00e1ndez had been killed in a September 2016 boat crash. On July 27, Harper hit one of four consecutive home runs by Nationals hitters off Milwaukee Brewers starter Michael Blazek; this was the first time that the feat had been accomplished in Major League Baseball since the 2011 season. On August 7, he hit his 150th home run. He was 24 years and 295 days old when he accomplished this feat, exactly the same age as Los Angeles Angels superstar Mike Trout when he hit his 150th home run. On August 12, Harper suffered a hyperextended left knee after reaching first base; the injury forced him to leave the game. It was later revealed that his left knee had a significant bone bruise, but no ligament damage, sending him to the disabled list but prompting team officials to say they were confident he could return before the end of the season. On September 27, Bryce was reactivated off of the DL against the Philadelphia Phillies. On October 13, Harper went 2\u20134 with an RBI in Game 5 of the NLDS, and made the last out of the game by striking out against Chicago Cubs' closer, Wade Davis, ending the Nationals' NLCS bid."

On September 3, 2019, Harper would bat his 100th RBI of the season for the second consecutive year and was the first Philadelphia Phillies player since Ryan Howard in 2011 to hit for 100 RBIs or more in a season. However, the Phillies missed the playoffs, while Harper's former team, the Washington Nationals, went on to win the World Series."

Harper attributes his work ethic to the lessons he learned from watching his father: \"I wanted to come out and I wanted to work hard because he worked hard. He did it for over 25 years.\" Harper's older brother, Bryan, also played in the Washington Nationals organization. While playing on different teams within the Nationals organization, the Harper brothers spoke by phone \"almost every day\" during the baseball season, according to Bryce. When he was a youth in Las Vegas, he also played alongside Joey Gallo and Kris Bryant. Harper is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has spoken publicly about his decision to abstain from alcohol. In 2014, he said that he sometimes drinks coffee during the baseball season. Though serving a mission is strongly encouraged for male members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who are between the ages of 18 and 26, it is not required. Harper decided his mission rested on the diamond. In a 2016 interview, he said, \"Coming up to the draft and trying to make that decision, I always thought that my Heavenly Father upstairs always just wanted me to be a walking Book of Mormon, you could say,\u201d [...] \u201cI knew that I could touch a lot of people\u2019s lives playing and trying to be the best Mormon that I can be on and off the field.\" Harper and his girlfriend Kayla Varner were engaged in 2014, but their wedding that was set for January 2015 did not take place. In July 2016, Kayla announced the couple's reconciliation and re-engagement. Harper married his longtime girlfriend in a ceremony at the San Diego California Temple in December 2016. Their first child, a son, was born in Las Vegas on August 22, 2019, while Harper was with his wife on paternity leave. Their second child, a daughter, was born in November 2020. In 2018, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and the District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation renovated a baseball field in the Takoma neighborhood of Washington, D.C. and named it Bryce Harper Field. Harper owns a customized Mercedes-Benz CLS that is outfitted with a low-light glow bat enclosure in the trunk and Nationals curly \"W\" insignia on the rear of the car; the insignia replaced the Mercedes logo. Harper is a fan of the Vegas Golden Knights of the NHL. He dropped the puck before a game in their inaugural season and put the Golden Knights' logo on his bat during their run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2018. After his first son's birth, the Vegas Golden Knights gifted him a personalized jersey."

Pudge Heffelfinger : Yale's guard, \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger was a native of Minnesota who was considered the greatest lineman of his time. Heffelfinger was paid $500 in 1892 to play for the Allegheny Athletic Association, making him the first professional football player. He was one of the charter inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame. Knowlton Ames : A native of Chicago, Princeton's All-America fullback \"Snake\" Ames set an unofficial collegiate scoring record in his time with 730 points, including 62 touchdowns and 176 points after touchdown. Ames is credited with being the first player to execute a fake punt and part of the first team to fully develop the \"power sweep.\" Ames moved west to coach Purdue University from 1891 to 1892. Hector Cowan : Princeton's tackle, \"Hec\" Cowan helped lead the 1889 Princeton team to a perfect 10\u20130 record. Pudge Heffelfinger later said of Cowan, \"He had the strongest shoulders and arms I've ever been up against and his stubby legs drove like pistons when he carried the ball. Hector could carry a couple of tacklers on his back, yet he was plenty fast in the open.\" He later served as the coach at the University of Kansas from 1894 to 1896. Edgar Allan Poe : Princeton's quarterback, Poe was named after his relative and celebrated poet Edgar Allan Poe. After Princeton beat Harvard, 41\u201315, a Harvard man reportedly asked a Princeton alumnus whether Poe was related to the great Edgar Allan Poe. According to the story, \"the alumnus looked at him in astonishment and replied, 'He is the great Edgar Allan Poe.'\" Poe graduated Phi Beta Kappa and later served as the Attorney General of the State of Maryland from 1911 to 1915. Arthur Cumnock : Harvard's Cumnock was known as a fierce tackler and has been ranked by one author as perhaps the greatest player in that school's long football tradition. Cumnock later went into the cotton mill business and was the treasurer of one of the largest corporations in New England. Roscoe Channing : Princeton's halfback Channing later served with Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish\u2013American War. For many years, he was the President of Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company, a copper mining company in Flin Flon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Charles O. Gill : Yale's Gill later coached at the University of California in 1894."

The following year, he joined Burton All Saints where he was spotted by a scout from Southampton. Described as a \"fine winger\", he joined Southampton in May 1923, making his first-team debut in a Second Division match at home to Barnsley on 19 January 1924, when he replaced the injured Jimmy Carr. MacDonald retained his place on the left wing for the remainder of the season, in partnership with Cliff Price, but failed to score. At the end of the season, he was placed on the transfer list at a fee of \u00a3250, but in June he moved to Southend United of the Third Division South, with the fee being waived. After a season at Southend, MacDonald moved to the Third Division North with Southport and then Doncaster Rovers, before settling at  Barrow in December 1926. Over the next three seasons, he was a virtual ever-present making 100 appearances for the Cumberland club before dropping down to non-league football in 1929."

        "content": "In the National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association, bonus rules in a quarter apply starting with the fifth team foul, with a rule change preventing a team not in the penalty late in a period from committing multiple fouls without penalty. The rules on the team foul penalty are similar to the FIBA version, with three major differences: Only defensive and loose-ball fouls count towards a team's limit for the team foul penalty. Offensive fouls do not count towards the team foul penalty unless a player is in the player foul penalty situation. The team foul penalty applies in a period after a team commits one foul in the final two minutes if the team had not reached the penalty phase in the first ten or eight minutes of that period. In other words, within any period free throws are awarded starting from the fifth foul OR from the second foul in the last two minutes of the period, whichever comes earlier. If a game enters overtime, the foul counts are reset to 0, and are similarly reset before each subsequent overtime period. The penalty phase starts with the fourth foul in each overtime period rather than five for regulation periods, since overtime periods are much shorter than regular game periods . As in regulation play, two free throws are awarded for non-shooting defensive fouls during the bonus period, and one foul in the final two minutes automatically puts the team in the team foul penalty."

        "content": "A player who commits his/her sixth personal foul and must remain in the game because the team has no eligible players remaining, or a player who was the last player to commit six fouls, and with no eligible players following an injury or ejection, is called back to the game, is charged with a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul, with the penalty of a single free throw, regardless of offensive or defensive foul. The player cannot be ejected for a technical foul for this situation. This type of technical foul serves in effect as a \"player foul penalty\" of a bonus free throw, similar to the team foul penalty. However, this bonus free throw is awarded regardless of the foul being an offensive or defensive foul, unlike a team foul penalty, where the two free throws only applies for defensive fouls. If an offensive player commits his/her sixth or subsequent foul, is an offensive foul, and there are no eligible players available, one free throw is still awarded, in addition to possession of the ball to the team shooting the free throw."

        "content": "The bonus situation is also used in American men's college basketball, but the NCAA rules are very different from the bonus rules of the NBA. The basic bonus rules remain the same, but the limit for team fouls is six per half. Upon committing the seventh foul of the half, a team is penalized and the opposing team is awarded at least one free throw for any defensive or loose-ball foul, no matter if the foul was shooting or non-shooting . In the case of a non-shooting foul, the opposing player must make the first free throw in order to be awarded a second free throw. This is commonly referred to as \"one-and-one\". Beginning with the tenth foul of a half, the fouled team is awarded two free throws on non-shooting fouls regardless of whether or not the first shot is made . For purposes of bonus, team fouls accrue from the second half on, as all overtimes are extensions of it. Women's college basketball followed men's bonus rules until the 2015\u201316 season, when it adopted FIBA bonus rules: four fouls per period; two free throws on every team foul over four; team fouls accrue from the fourth period on, as all overtimes are extensions of it. The NCAA regularly uses its second-tier tournament for Division I men's teams, the National Invitation Tournament, as a testing ground for experimental rules, and the bonus situation is no exception. The following bonus-related rules have been used in the 2017, 2018, and 2019 editions: In 2017 and 2019, both team foul counts were reset to zero at the 10-minute mark of each half . In 2018, games were played in quarters, matching current practice in NCAA women's basketball, instead of the halves used in the current NCAA men's rules. In all three tournaments, the team foul limit was four per 10-minute block , identical to the NCAA women's limit for each quarter. Also in all three tournaments, two shots were awarded for all non-shooting defensive or loose-ball fouls upon the fifth team foul in a 10-minute block. This is also identical to the current NCAA women's rule. In 2017 and 2019, each overtime period was considered a separate period for accumulation of team fouls, as in the NBA. The fourth team foul in an overtime period triggered the so-called \"double bonus\". In 2019 only, the NBA rule regarding team fouls in the final 2 minutes of a quarter during regulation, or any overtime period, was adopted between 8:00 and 10:00 and 18:00 and 20:00 of each half, as well as the final 2 minutes of any overtime. The rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations , which govern high school basketball in the United States, follow NCAA men's rules on this point for both boys' and girls' play. Even though the NFHS rules divide the game into quarters, the team foul count resets only at halftime."

        "content": "Henry Chadwick is credited with devising the statistic, which caught on as a measure of pitching effectiveness after relief pitching came into vogue in the 1900s. Prior to 1900\u2014and, in fact, for many years afterward\u2014pitchers were routinely expected to pitch a complete game, and their win-loss record was considered sufficient in determining their effectiveness. After pitchers like James Otis Crandall and Charley Hall made names for themselves as relief specialists, gauging a pitcher's effectiveness became more difficult using the traditional method of tabulating wins and losses. Some criterion was needed to capture the apportionment of earned-run responsibility for a pitcher in games that saw contributions from other pitchers for the same team. Since pitchers have primary responsibility for  putting opposing batters out, they must assume responsibility when a batter they do not retire at the plate moves to base, and eventually reaches home, scoring a run. A pitcher is assessed an earned run for each run scored by a batter who reaches base while batting against that pitcher.  The National League first tabulated official earned run average statistics in 1912 , and the American League later accepted this standard and began compiling ERA statistics. Baseball encyclopedias will often display ERAs for earlier years, but these were computed retroactively. Negro league pitchers are often rated by RA, or total runs allowed, since the statistics available for Negro league games did not always distinguish between earned and unearned runs."

        "content": "As with batting average, the definition of a good ERA varies from year to year. During the dead-ball era of the 1900s and 1910s, an ERA below 2.00 was considered good. In the late 1920s and through the 1930s, when conditions of the game changed in a way that strongly favored hitters, a good ERA was below 4.00; only the highest caliber pitchers, for example Dazzy Vance or Lefty Grove, would consistently post an ERA under 3.00 during these years. In the 1960s, sub-2.00 ERAs returned, as other influences such as ballparks with different dimensions were introduced. Starting with the 2019 season, an ERA under 4.00 is again considered good. The single-season record for the lowest ERA is held by Dutch Leonard, who in 1914 had an earned run average of 0.96, pitching 224.2 innings with a win-loss record of 19\u20135.  The all-time record for the lowest single season earned run average by a pitcher pitching 300 or more innings is 1.12, set by Bob Gibson in 1968.

Thus, if a relief pitcher enters the game with his team leading by 1 run, with 2 outs and the bases loaded, and then gives up a single which scores 2 runs, he is not charged with those runs. If he retires the next batter , his ERA for that game will be 0.00 despite having surrendered the lead. Starting pitchers operate under the same rules but are not called upon to start pitching with runners already on base. In addition, relief pitchers know beforehand that they will only be pitching for a relatively short while, allowing them to exert themselves more for each pitch, unlike starters who typically need to conserve their energy over the course of a game in case they are asked to pitch 7 or more innings. The reliever's freedom to use their maximum energy for a few innings, or even for just a few batters, helps relievers keep their ERAs down. ERA, taken by itself, can also be misleading when trying to objectively judge starting pitchers, though not to the extent seen with relief pitchers."

Since then, pitchers spending all or most of their careers in the AL have been at a disadvantage in maintaining low ERAs, compared to National League pitchers who can often get an easy out when pitching to the opposition's pitcher, who is usually not a very good batter. Since 1997, when teams began playing teams from the other league during the regular season, the DH rule is in effect only when such interleague games are played in an American League park. This difference between the leagues also affects relievers, but not to the same degree. This is because National League relievers actually pitch to pitchers less often than NL starters do for a number of reasons, chiefly because relievers are usually active in later innings when pinch hitters tend to be used in the pitcher's batting spot."

        "content": "ERA is also affected somewhat by the ballpark in which a pitcher's team plays half its games, as well as the tendency of hometown official scorers to assign errors instead of base hits in plays that could be either. As an extreme example, pitchers for the Colorado Rockies have historically faced many problems, all damaging to their ERAs. The combination of high altitude and a semi-arid climate in Denver causes fly balls to travel up to 10% farther than at sea level. Denver's altitude and low humidity also reduce the ability of pitchers to throw effective breaking balls, due to both reduced air resistance and difficulty in gripping very dry baseballs. These conditions have been countered to some extent since 2002 by the team's use of humidors to store baseballs before games. These difficult circumstances for Rockies pitchers may not adversely affect their win-loss records, since opposing pitchers must deal with the same problems. Indeed, hometown hurlers have some advantage in any given game since they are physically acclimated to the altitude and often develop techniques to mitigate the challenges of this ballpark. Still, conditions there tend to inflate Rockies' ERAs relative to the rest of the league."

Further, because of the dependence of ERA on factors over which a pitcher has little control, forecasting future ERAs on the basis of the past ERAs of a given pitcher is not very reliable and can be improved if analysts rely on other performance indicators such as strike out rates and walk rates. For example, this is the premise of Nate Silver's forecasts of ERAs using his PECOTA system. Silver also developed a \"quick\" earned run average to calculate an ERA from peripheral statistics including strikeouts, walks, and groundball percentage. Unlike peripheral ERA or PERA, it does not take into account park effects. Another statistic derived from ERA is Adjusted ERA, also called ERA+, which adjusts a pitcher's ERA to a scale where 100 is average for the league and takes into account the various dimensions and other factors of each ballpark."

The Cardinals compete in Major League Baseball as a member club of the National League Central division. Since the 2006 season, the Cardinals have played their home games at Busch Stadium in downtown St. Louis. One of the nation's oldest and most successful professional baseball clubs, the Cardinals have won 11 World Series championships, the most of any NL team and second in MLB only to the New York Yankees. The team has won 19 National League pennants, third-most of any team. St. Louis has also won 14 division titles in the East and Central divisions. In 1881, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased the Brown Stockings barnstorming club, renamed it the St. Louis Browns, and made it a charter member of the American Association baseball league. The team won four league championships, qualifying them to play in the era's professional baseball championship series, a forerunner of the modern World Series. In two of these championships, the Browns met the Chicago White Stockings, now the Chicago Cubs launching the enduring Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry. In 1892, the Browns \u2013 also called the Perfectos \u2013 joined the National League. In 1900, the team was renamed the Cardinals. Notable Cardinals achievements include manager/owner Branch Rickey's invention of the farm system, Rogers Hornsby's two batting Triple Crowns, Dizzy Dean's 30-win season in 1934, Stan Musial's 17 MLB and 29 NL records, Bob Gibson's 1.12 earned run average in 1968, Whitey Herzog's Whiteyball, Mark McGwire's single-season home run record in 1998, and the 2011 championship team's unprecedented comebacks. The Cardinals have won 105 or more games in four seasons and won 100 or more nine times. Cardinals players have won 20 league MVPs, four batting Triple Crowns, and three Cy Young Awards. Baseball Hall of Fame inductees include Lou Brock, Dizzy Dean, Bob Gibson, Whitey Herzog, Rogers Hornsby, Joe Medwick, Stan Musial, Enos Slaughter, Branch Rickey, Red Schoendienst, Ozzie Smith, Ted Simmons, and Bruce Sutter. In 2018, Forbes valued the Cardinals at $1.9\u00a0billion, 7th-highest among MLB clubs and far more than the $147\u00a0million paid in 1995 by owner William DeWitt, Jr.'s investment group. In 2017, the team took in revenue of $319\u00a0million on an operating income of $40.0\u00a0million. John Mozeliak is the President of Baseball Operations, Mike Girsch is the general manager and Oliver Marmol is the manager. The Cardinals are renowned for their strong fan support: despite being in one of the sport's mid-level markets, they routinely see attendances among the league's highest, and are consistently among the top three in MLB in local television ratings. Through 2021, the Cardinals' all-time win-loss record is 11,038\u201310,163 ."

        "title": "St. Louis Cardinals_History",
        "content": "Before the Cardinals Professional baseball began in St. Louis with the inception of the Brown Stockings in the National Association in 1875. The NA folded following that season, and the next season, St. Louis joined the National League as a charter member, finishing in third place at 45\u201319. George Bradley hurled the first no-hitter in Major League history. The NL expelled St. Louis from the league after 1877 due to a game-fixing scandal and the team went bankrupt. Without a league, they continued play as a semi-professional barnstorming team through 1881. The magnitudes of the reorganizations, following the 1877 and 1881 seasons, are such that the 1875\u20131877 and 1878\u20131881 Brown Stockings teams are not generally considered to share continuity as a franchise with the current St. Louis Cardinals. American Association and early National League eras For the 1882 season, Chris von der Ahe purchased the team, reorganized it, and made it a founding member of the American Association , a league to rival the NL. 1882 is generally considered to be the first year of existence for the franchise which would later become known as the St. Louis Cardinals. The next season, St. Louis shortened their name to the Browns. Soon thereafter they became the dominant team in the AA, as manager Charlie Comiskey guided St. Louis to four pennants in a row from 1885 to 1888. Pitcher and outfielder Bob Caruthers led the league in ERA and wins in 1885 and finished in the top six in both in each of the following two seasons. He also led the AA in OBP and OPS in 1886 and finished fourth in batting average in 1886 and fifth in 1887 . Outfielder Tip O'Neill won the first batting triple crown in franchise history in 1887 and the only one in AA history. By winning the pennant, the Browns played the NL pennant winner in a predecessor of the World Series. The Browns twice met the Chicago White Stockings \u2014 the predecessor to the Chicago Cubs \u2014 tying one in a heated dispute and winning the other, thus spurring the vigorous St. Louis-Chicago rivalry that ensues to this day. During the franchise's ten seasons in the AA, they compiled an all-time league-high of 780 wins and .639 winning percentage. They lost just 432 contests while tying 21 others. The AA went bankrupt after the 1891 season and the Browns transferred to the National League. This time, the club entered an era of stark futility. Between 1892 and 1919, St. Louis managed just five winning seasons, finished in last or next-to-last place sixteen times, and ended four seasons with 100 losses or more. The nadir was the 1897 season: a 29\u2013102 record for a franchise-worst .221 winning percentage. St. Louis' 84\u201367 finish as the Perfectos in 1899 would be the team's best finish between the AA era and Sam Breadon's purchase of the team. As the \"Perfectos\", the team wore their jersey with a cardinal red trim and sock striping. Later that season, St. Louis Republic sportswriter Willie McHale included an account in a column of a female fan he heard remarking about the uniforms, \"What a lovely shade of cardinal.\" Fans liked the moniker \"Cardinals\" and, the next year in 1900, popularity for the nickname induced an official change to Cardinals. In 1902, an American League team moved from Milwaukee into St. Louis, renamed themselves the St. Louis Browns and built a new park on the site of the Cardinals' old stadium, striking a rivalry that lasted five decades. Breadon bought a minority interest in the Cardinals in 1917 and in 1919 Browns manager Branch Rickey joined the Cardinals. The Cardinals' first 28 seasons in the NL were a complete reversal of their stay in the AA \u2013 with a .406 winning percentage, they compiled 1,632 wins, 2,425 losses and 74 ties. Breadon era St. Louis baseball commenced a renaissance: since 1926 the Cardinals have won eleven World Series and nineteen NL pennants. Breadon spurred this revival when he bought out the majority stake in 1920 and appointed Rickey as business manager, who expanded scouting, player development, and pioneered the minor league farm system, filling the role of today's general manager. With Rogers Hornsby at second base, he claimed Triple Crowns in 1922 and 1925, and the Cardinals won the 1926 World Series, their first. St. Louis then won the league in 1928, 1930, and 1931 and the 1931 World Series. The Gashouse Gang edition claimed the 1934 World Series and the Cardinals amassed new thresholds of popularity far outside St. Louis via radio, which led to the coining of the term \"Cardinal Nation.\" Dizzy Dean led the Gang, winning the 1934 MVP, and leading the NL multiple times in wins, strikeouts, innings, complete games and shutouts. Johnny Mize and Joe Medwick emerged as two power threats, with Medwick claiming the last Triple Crown for a Cardinal in 1937. In the 1940s, a golden era emerged as Rickey's farm system became laden with such talent as Marty Marion, Enos Slaughter, Mort Cooper, Walker Cooper, Stan Musial, Max Lanier, Whitey Kurowski, Red Schoendienst and Johnny Beazley. It was one of the most successful decades in franchise history with 960 wins and 580 losses for a winning percentage higher than any other Major League team at .623. With Billy Southworth managing, they won the World Series in 1942 and 1944 , and won 105 or more games each in 1942, 1943, and 1944. Southworth's managerial winning percentage is St. Louis' highest since the franchise joined the National League. Musial was considered the most consistent hitter of his era and most accomplished in team history, winning three MVPs and seven batting titles. St. Louis then won the 1946 World Series on Slaughter's Mad Dash in Game 7. Breadon was forced to sell the team in 1947 but won six World Series and nine NL pennants as Cardinals owner. They remained competitive, finishing .500 or better in thirteen of the next seventeen seasons, but fell short of winning the league or World Series until 1964. Gussie Busch era In 1953 the Anheuser-Busch brewery bought the Cardinals and August \"Gussie\" Busch became team president, spurring the Browns' departure in 1953 to Baltimore to become the Orioles, and making the Cardinals the only major league club in town. More success followed in the 1960s, starting with what is considered one of the most lopsided trades in Major League history, as St. Louis received outfielder Lou Brock from the Cubs for pitcher Ernie Broglio. MVP third baseman Ken Boyer and pitcher Bob Gibson led the club to a World Series win the same year and Curt Flood, Bill White, Curt Simmons, and Steve Carlton also made key contributions in this decade. In 1967, new arrival Orlando Cepeda won the MVP, helping to propel St. Louis to the World Series. The Cardinals won the league the following year behind their Major League-leading 2.49 staff ERA in what was an all-round record-breaking season of pitching dominance.   Posting a modern-day record low ERA of 1.12 and striking out a one-game World Series-record of 17, Gibson won both the MVP and Cy Young awards that year. However, the Cardinals failed to repeat as World Series champions, blowing a 3\u20131 lead to the underdog Detroit Tigers. In the 1970s, catcher/third baseman Joe Torre and first baseman Keith Hern\u00e1ndez each won MVPs, but the team's best finishes were second place and 90 wins. The team found their way back to the World Series three times in the 1980s, starting with manager Whitey Herzog and his Whiteyball style of play and another trade that altered course of the franchise: in 1982, shortstop Garry Templeton was shipped to the Padres for fellow shortstop Ozzie Smith. Widely regarded as one of the best defensive players in history, Smith ranks first all-time among shortstops in Gold Glove Awards , All-Star games , assists , and double plays . St. Louis won the 1982 World Series from the Milwaukee Brewers that fall. The Cardinals again won the league in 1985 and 1987. In the 1985 Series, they faced-off with cross-state rivals Kansas City Royals for the first time in a non-exhibition game, but they lost the series after a controversial call in game 6; the 1987 series saw them face off against the Minnesota Twins, but could only win all three of their games played at home in the seven-game series. Bill DeWitt era After Gussie Busch died in 1989, the brewery took control and hired Joe Torre to manage late in 1990, then sold the team to an investment group led by William DeWitt, Jr. in 1996. Tony La Russa replaced Torre in the spring of 1996. In 1998, Mark McGwire competed with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa for a barrage of home runs in their pursuit of the single-season home run record. From 2000 to 2013, the Cardinals reestablished their way to the top with ten playoff appearances, four NL pennants, two World Series titles and 1,274 regular season wins against 993 losses for a .560 winning percentage, leading the National League and second in MLB only to the New York Yankees. With the addition of Jim Edmonds, Albert Pujols, and Scott Rolen, the Cardinals featured three prominent sluggers and defenders nicknamed \"MV3;\" Pujols won three MVPs and hit .328 with 445 home runs in his Cardinals career. In 2004, playoff stalwart Chris Carpenter's 3.09 ERA and 15 wins helped power the team to a major-league best 105 wins and take the NL pennant. In 2006, beset with injuries and inconsistency, they won the World Series, beating Detroit in five games to set an all-time record-low of 83 wins for a World Series winner. In 2009, the Cardinals reached 10,000 wins, dating to when they first played in the American Association . St. Louis returned to the playoffs in 2011, first surmounting the largest games-won deficit after 130 games to upstage the Atlanta Braves on the final day for the wild card playoff berth. In Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols became just the third player to hit three home runs in a World Series game. In Game 6, third baseman David Freese and outfielder Lance Berkman each tied the score on the Cardinals' final strike \u2014 the first such occurrence in any game in MLB history \u2014 and St. Louis defeated the Texas Rangers later that game with a walk-off home run from Freese. After winning that Series, La Russa retired and became the only manager to do so after winning a title. He also finished with the most wins for managers in franchise history with 1,408. La Russa's successor, Mike Matheny, helped extend St. Louis' playoff run as he became the first manager in the division play era to guide the Cardinals to the NLCS and playoffs in his first two seasons. In 2014, the Cardinals extended their NLCS streak to 4, with their 3\u20131 series victory over the Dodgers, in the NLDS. Ten days after being eliminated from the postseason by the San Francisco Giants, rookie outfielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident while traveling to his hometown Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. On November 17, they acquired Atlanta Braves right-fielder Jason Heyward to replace Taveras. On June 16, 2015, the FBI and the Justice Department started an investigation on the Cardinals for possibly hacking the Houston Astros. The hacking incident was perpetrated by Scouting Director Chris Correa. For the first time since the 2007\u20132008 seasons, the Cardinals missed the playoffs in consecutive years, 2016\u20132017. On July 14, 2018, following an 8\u20132 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, the St. Louis Cardinals announced they had dismissed manager Mike Matheny after  seasons. The team then named Mike Shildt interim manager, and he was made the permanent manager a month later. On November 19, 2018, the team announced that the \"Victory Blue\" uniforms, worn by the Cardinals during the late 1970s and 1980s, would be returning for the 2019 season. The uniforms, integrating the powder blue color with the team's current \"Saturday alternate\" jersey design, were to be worn 13 times on the road during the 2019 season. The Cardinals acquired Paul Goldschmidt in a trade from the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 5, 2018."

The stadium opened for the 2006 season at a cost of $411\u00a0million and holds a normal capacity of 46,861. The Cardinals finished their inaugural season in the new Busch Stadium by winning the 2006 World Series, the first team since the 1923 New York Yankees to do so. This open-air stadium emulates the HOK Sport -designed \"retro-style\" baseball-only parks built since the 1990s. The open panoramic perspective over the outfield wall offers a remarkable view of St. Louis' downtown skyline featuring the distinctive Gateway Arch. A replica of Eads Bridge spans the entrance to the park on the third base side, while the statue of Stan Musial arises in front of that entrance. Other statues at the corner of 8th and Clark include Hall of Famers Rogers Hornsby, Ozzie Smith, George Sisler, Cool Papa Bell, Bob Gibson, Jack Buck and others. Due to increased demand, Game 7 of the 2011 World Series accommodated a baseball record of 47,399 by increasing the number of standing room only tickets. The attendance record for any sporting event is 48,263, in a 2013 association football friendly match between Chelsea F.C. and Manchester City F.C., made possible by on field seating. The largest attendance of any event at Busch belongs to U2 during a concert from their 360\u00b0 Tour in 2011. Ballpark Village, a mixed-use development located across Clark Street from Busch Stadium, is targeted to enhance the ballpark goers' experience. Phase 1 of the development, completed for the start of the 2014 season, includes entertainment venues, restaurants, and retail. Anchored by Cardinals Nation , a  Budweiser Brew House, FOX Sports Midwest Live! and PBR, the $100\u00a0million phase 1 development of Ballpark Village is intended to be a gathering space throughout the year, not just during the baseball season."

        "content": "Busch Stadium is the Cardinals' fourth home ballpark and the third to bear that name. The Cardinals' original home ballpark was Sportsman's Park from 1882 to 1892 when they played in the American Association and were known as the Browns. In 1893, the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920. The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison Field. Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the St. Louis Browns. In 1953, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season, becoming the Orioles. The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium, or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005. It was built as the multi-purpose stadium home of both the baseball Cardinals and the NFL football Cardinals, who are now the Arizona Cardinals; the NFL's Rams also played the first four games of their home schedule upon their arrival in St. Louis in 1995. The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium."

        "title": "St. Louis Cardinals_Logos and uniforms",
        "content": "The Cardinals have had few logos throughout their history, although those logos have evolved over time. The first logo associated with the Cardinals was an interlocking \"SL\" that appeared on the team's caps and or sleeves as early as 1900. Those early uniforms usually featured the name \"St. Louis\" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had cardinal red accents. In 1920, the \"SL\" largely disappeared from the team's uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white with red striping and a red bill. In 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms for the first time that featured the two familiar cardinal birds perched on a baseball bat over the name \"Cardinals\" with the letter \"C\" of the word hooked over the bat. The concept of the birds originated after general manager Branch Rickey noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring cardinal birds on a table in a Presbyterian church in Ferguson, Missouri, at which he was speaking. The arrangement's production was by a woman named Allie May Schmidt. Schmidt's father, a graphic designer, helped Rickey make the logo a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms. Colloquially referred to as the \"birds on the bat\", it initially appeared with the birds perched on a black bat and \"Cardinals\" in printed letters. An alternate version of this logo with \"St. Louis\" replacing \"Cardinals\" appeared in 1930 and was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before \"Cardinals\" returned. In 1940, the now-familiar \"\" logo was introduced on the team's caps. The interlocking \"\" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has appeared on the team's caps every year since. The first appearance of the \"STL\" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of navy blue as a uniform color. From 1940 until 1955, the team wore navy blue caps with red bills and a red interlocking \"\" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red and navy blue accents. In 1951, the \"birds on the bat\" logo was changed to feature a yellow baseball bat. In 1956, the Cardinals changed their caps to solid blue with a red \"\", removing the red bill. Also, for that season only, the Cardinals wore a script \"Cardinals\" wordmark on their uniforms excluding the \"birds on the bat.\" An updated version of the \"birds on the bat\" logo returned in 1957 with the word \"Cardinals\" written in cursive beneath the bat; this logo, with some incremental changes along the way, has been the team's logo since. In 1962, the Cardinals became the first National League team to display players' names on the back of their jerseys. In 1964, while retaining their blue caps for road games, the Cardinals changed their home caps to all red with a white interlocking \"\". The next year, the red caps were the only cap worn by the team full-time. In 1967, the birds on the bat emblem on the jersey was again tweaked, making the birds more realistic and changing the position of their tails relative to the bat and this version remained on all Cardinals game jerseys through 1997. In 1971, following the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced the traditional flannel front-button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover knit jerseys and beltless elastic waist pants. In 1973, the crew-neck collar became a V-neck. Another trend in baseball led the Cardinals to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976 to 1984; the player numbers were worn on the sleeves in 1979 and 1980. In 1992, the Cardinals returned to wearing traditional button-down shirts and pants with belts. That same year, they also brought back the all-navy cap with a red \"\" on the road only while wearing the same red and white cap for home games only. In 1998, the \"birds on the bat\" was updated for the first time in 30 years with more detailed birds and bolder letters. That year, St. Louis introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched on a bat worn only on Sunday home games. Up until 2020, the alternate \"bird\" caps were paired with their primary \"\" red batting helmets, but in the 2021 season, the Cardinals added a new helmet to match their home Sunday alternate caps. The new birds on the bat design was modified again the next year, with yellow beaks and white eyes replacing the red beaks and yellow eyes of the 1998 version. Uniform numbers also returned to the front of the jerseys in 1999 after a two-year absence. On November 16, 2012, the Cardinals unveiled a new alternate uniform to be worn at home games on Saturdays beginning with the 2013 season. The modified jersey, cream-colored with red trim on the sleeves and down the front, was the first since 1932 in which \"St. Louis\" will be used instead of \"Cardinals\" and retained the \"birds on the bat.\" 2013 also saw the team adopt their red caps as their main cap for both home and away games for the first time since 1991; the navy cap was retained as an alternate, used mainly against other red-capped teams. Over the years, the Cardinals have released various marketing logos depicting anthropomorphized cardinals in a pitching stance, swinging a baseball bat, or wearing a baseball cap that never became part of the game uniform. Starting with the 2019 season, the Cardinals will wear updated powder blue alternate uniforms during Saturday road games. Like the Saturday home cream alternates, it features red piping and \"St. Louis\" below the \"birds on the bat\" logo. In 2020, the Cardinals will wear a slightly updated version of their \"\" cap logo, which was \"soft launched\" in 2019 via their social media accounts and game broadcasts."

He is assisted by Team Fredbird, a group of eleven women who entertain fans from the field and on top of the dugouts. While unofficial, the Rally Squirrel became an unexpected phenomenon during the 2011 postseason. Making its \"debut\" in Game 3 of the NLDS on October 4, a squirrel ran across home plate in the middle of a pitch from Roy Oswalt of the Phillies to the Cardinals' Skip Schumaker. The Cardinals would win Game 4 and subsequently Game 5 in Philadelphia to advance to the NLCS, symbolizing the squirrel's \"role\" in the victory. The squirrel was popularized as \"Buschie the Rally Squirrel\". As a tribute to the popularity of the squirrel, a small depiction of the Rally Squirrel is also included on the official World Series rings the team received. It shows up under the \"STL\" logo on the side of the ring. Fredbird sparked controversy in May 2015, when he was asked by a fan for a photograph and handed him a sign that said \"Police Lives Matter\".

As with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed as to whether the purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a \"small market\", which appears to handicap a club's competitiveness. Such was the case when Sam Breadon put the Cardinals up for sale in 1947: then-NL President Ford Frick proposed moving the Cardinals to Chicago. When AB placed the Cardinals for sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would keep the club in St. Louis. In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147\u00a0million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur, Hanser and DeWitt, Jr. Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the Baur ownership group. Baur's group then sold the garages to another investment group, lowering the net franchise purchase price to about $100\u00a0million, about $10\u00a0million less than Financial World's value of the team at the time $110\u00a0million. Current Cincinnati Reds owners Bob Castellini and brothers Thomas Williams and W. Joseph Williams Jr. each once owned a stake in the Cardinals dating back to the Baur-DeWitt group's purchase of the team. To allow their purchase of the Reds in 2005, the rest of the group bought out Castellini's and the Williams brothers' shares, totaling an estimated 13 percent. At that time, the Forbes valued the Cardinals at about $370\u00a0million. However, after reabsorbing that stake into the remainder of the group, they decided to make it available to new investors in 2010. Amid later allegations that the Cardinals owed the city profit shares, DeWitt revealed that their profitability had not reached the threshold to trigger that obligation."

Home runs and RBI in a game: Jim Bottomley drove in 12 runs against Brooklyn on September 16, 1924, an all-time MLB single-game record that still stands. On September 7, 1993, Mark Whiten tied that record and another MLB single-game record with four home runs. 2 Grand Slams in a single inning: Fernando Tat\u00eds is the only player in Major League history to hit two grand slam home runs in the same inning, on April 23, 1999. Both were against Chan Ho Park of the Dodgers."

Capable of reaching 21 million listeners in nine states including Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee, the Cardinals radio network is the second-largest in MLB with 117 affiliate stations. Mike Shannon and John Rooney alternate as play-by-play announcers, with Chris Hrabe serving as pre-game and post-game host. KMOX's 50,000-watt clear-channel signal covers much of the continental United States at night. At one time, owing to the Cardinals' status as a \"regional\" franchise, the Cardinals radio network reached almost half of the country. The 2011 season marked the Cardinals' return to KMOX following five seasons on KTRS , a station which is 50 percent owned by the Cardinals. With a partnership spanning seven decades, and continuously since 1954, its conclusion was realized after the 2005 season when the then owners of KMOX, CBS Radio, and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights agreement. However, frustrated by the underpowered coverage of 5,000-watt KTRS, the Cardinals reached a new deal with KMOX in 2011. Starting in 2013 , Shannon started reducing his workload. As of the 2016 season, he only called home games for the Cardinals. As of the 2019 season, his 47th in the broadcast booth, he surpassed Jack Buck, his long-time broadcast companion, as the longest-tenured Cardinal broadcaster. On January 14, 2021, Shannon announced that the upcoming season, his 50th season in the broadcast booth, would be his last."

        "content": "The club was formed in 1987, and for the first 23 years of its existence played at regional league level. After being crowned champions of the Mid-Ulster Football League Intermediate A division in the 2009\u201310 season, the club was elected to Championship 2 for the first time by the Championship Committee. During their first season, they defeated Cliftonville 3\u20131 on penalties at Solitude in the fifth round of the 2010\u201311 Irish Cup \u2013 at the time, the biggest result in the club's history. It went on to become a very successful season for the club, as they adapted to the step-up to Championship 2 emphatically, winning the division by nine points and losing only one of the 30 games in the process. This secured their second consecutive promotion, elevating them to Championship 1, the second tier of Northern Irish football. In their first season in Championship 1 they found the next step up more difficult to adapt to but still avoided relegation, finishing in 12th place \u2013 nine points clear of the relegation zone. At the start of the 2012\u201313 season the demise of Newry City allowed the club to inherit some of Newry's players \u2013 strengthening their squad substantially. They eventually finished as runners-up, and qualified for the promotion play-off against Donegal Celtic, who had finished second-bottom in the Premiership. Warrenpoint won the tie on the away goals rule after it ended 2\u20132 on aggregate, to reach the top flight for the first time in the club's history. This rounded off a very successful few years for the club, going from the Mid Ulster Football League Intermediate A division to the Premiership in only four seasons. In their first season in the top flight, when many had expected the club to go straight back down, the club played their home fixtures at Dungannon Swifts' ground, Stangmore Park, until 30 November 2013 because their home ground did not meet Premiership criteria. During this period the ground was upgraded to top flight standard and the club managed to survive that season. In 2014\u201315, the Point did not have an overall good season, finishing in 11th position and suffered a difficult time against Bangor in the Relegation Play-Off losing 2\u20130 in the first league at Clandeboye Park before winning 2\u20130 at Milltown and beating the Seasiders on penalties. In 2015\u201316, Warrenpoint Town suffered a poor start to their season, being bottom of the table with just four points at Christmas. Following the sale of star striker Daniel Hughes to Cliftonville, the club received Martin Murray and Johnny McMurray from Cliftonville as part of the deal to take Hughes to Solitude. The club had a dramatic upturn in fortunes, first reaching a league cup semi final, before losing 1\u20130 to Cliftonville after extra-time, and in one of the biggest shocks in Irish league history, the Point beat Glentoran 4\u20130 at The Oval. The Point were relegated on the final day of the season. While leading 1\u20130 against Dungannon Swifts and needing a win to stay up, Warrenpoint defender Jordan Dane collided with Andrew Mitchell, and despite Dane falling over, referee Ross Dunlop awarded Dungannon a penalty, much to the disbelief of the home support and players.  Mitchell missed the penalty but scored on the rebound at the second attempt, to relegate Warrenpoint Town with the last kick of the game  sending them back to NIFL Championship 1. Mid-season the following year, manager Barry Gray took the decision to step down and help the club with board matters and made the decision to appoint first team coach Matthew Tipton as manager. Tipton took the club to the top of the table in NIFL Championship 1 by Christmas time and had remarkably beaten Glenavon 3\u20131 in the Mid-Ulster Cup to reach their first ever Mid-Ulster Cup final. The club sealed their return to the NIFL Premiership with a 3\u20132 win over Institute in April 2017."

In June 2010, along with Tissone, Rossini's co-ownership deal with Udinese was extended and he was loaned back to Sampdoria, however he did not make an immediate first-team appearance for them. On 3 January 2011, Rossini was again loaned to Sassuolo for the remainder of the 2010\u201311 season, where he appeared in 18 league matches Serie B. Rossini returned to Sampdoria for the 2011\u201312 season under manager Giuseppe Iachini. He made his Sampdoria debut on 19 November 2011 against Reggina, where he helped earn Sampdoria promotion to Serie A after they won the Serie B play-offs. After promotion to Serie A, under new manager Ciro Ferrara, Rossini was first-choice centre-back alongside captain Daniele Gastaldello at the heart of the defence. Rossini's first Serie A match was against Milan on 26 August 2012. After the arrival of new manager Delio Rossi, Rossini lost his place in the team after Angelo Palombo returned from Internazionale and was played regularly at centre-back, at Rossini's expense. In total, Rossini made 25 Serie A appearances in the 2012\u201313 season.

Parma On 21 January 2014, Rossini was loaned out the fellow Serie A club Parma for the remainder of the season, with Aleandro Rosi moving in the opposite direction to Sassuolo, also on loan. Rossini mainly found himself used as the backup at centre-back to Italian international Gabriel Paletta and club captain Alessandro Lucarelli. Parma finished the season in sixth position and qualified for Europe. However, because Parma was ineligible to qualify for European competitions, Torino was given their place in the UEFA Europa League. On 20 June 2014, Sampdoria relinquished the Rossini's remaining 50% rights to Sassuolo for free. Bari On 11 July 2014, after Rossini began training with English Championship club Leeds United, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino revealed the club was looking to sign Rossini on a year-long loan with the option to make the move permanent. However, on 13 July, Leeds opted to abandon the deal due to concerns of Rossini's lack of fitness, and the player returned to Sassuolo. Cellino said, \"We want special players at Leeds United. Rossini didn't show enough during the three days he trained with the rest of the team. After speaking to him, it is clear that he didn't have the right attitude to join Leeds, so we have allowed him to leave.\" On 17 July 2014, Rossini joined Serie B club Bari on loan from Sassuolo.

        "content": "The initial foundations of the club were set down in 1952 by a small group of Croatian immigrants who met at the home of Hinko Durakovic at 7 Leeds Street in the western suburb of Footscray to discuss the formation of a Croatian soccer club. The founders of the club were Perica Filipovic , Ivica Matosevic, Tonika Durakovic, Drago Jukic and Hinko Durakovic. The club was given the name SC Croatia and from the very beginning it was decided the club's colours would be the tri-colours of the Croatian flag ; red jerseys, white shorts and blue socks. An initial difficulty in fielding teams led SC Croatia to recruit players from various suburbs across Melbourne, as well as from outside the city in Geelong and even the Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in north-eastern Victoria. The club went as far as to meet arriving boats of immigrants at ports in Melbourne and Geelong to recruit players. Despite these initial difficulties the club quickly became successful, making its playing debut on 10 April 1953 . In 1954 the club became an affiliate of the state's governing body Victorian Amateur Soccer Football Association, which saw SC Croatia join and compete in a league competition for the first time that same year in the newly created Victorian Provisional League . The club's opening match took place on 1 May 1954 against BWR, which finished 3-3. The club's first win coming the week after on 8 May, with a 4\u20131 victory over Box Hill. It was a successful debut year for the club as they finished second, four points behind the league champions South Yarra. Also in 1954 SC Croatia participated in its first Dockerty Cup, the young club was knocked out in the opening round losing to Yallourn 12\u20131."

        "content": "In 1957 after the conclusion of the season SC Croatia led by Joe Radojevic shifted its base to Geelong, where it would remain until 1962, which had become a hub for the Croatian community. SC Croatia amalgamated with the Croatia club of Geelong which had been founded in 1954. For those years in Geelong the club's home ground was initially at Separation Street in North Geelong before making the move to Corio Oval. SC Croatia quickly moved up the state divisions, and by 1959 they were in Division 1 just outside the premier competition of the State League. The club's first title came in 1959, winning the Division 1 championship over Preston on goal difference. That season included SC Croatia's club record 29\u20131 victory over Brunswick, one of the highest scores ever recorded in a senior Australian football match. With three rounds to go in the season Preston led the league by a point from the second place Lions and two points ahead of SC Croatia in third. SC Croatia had to win all of the three remaining games to take the title, which included two matches against the Lions. SC Croatia was successful as it won the 3 matches, defeating the Lions 3-0 and 3\u20131 to clinch the title by a point over Preston. That year SC Croatia also made the 5th round of the Dockerty Cup, the furthest the club had been in the competition up until that point. Controversy embroiled the league in its post-season, which saw SC Croatia stripped of its Division 1 title after a successful appeal by the second placed Preston to overturn a result earlier in the season in their match against the Lions. The title was handed to Preston, whom gained promotion to the Victorian State League. It was a bitter blow to the club, made worse by the fact the club was only informed they would not be competing in the Victorian Soccer League a month before the start of the 1960 season. The Preston club having not expected to be participating in the top league and was not prepared for the move, having lost the bulk of its squad. In an act of desperation the president of the Preston club contacted the president of SC Croatia, Joe Radojevic, to merge the two clubs. This was a move not supported by many at SC Croatia, so a vote was taken by the committee. The vote was very close, going just in favour of not merging. But unknown to members of the committee Joe Radojevic had already arranged the merger with the Federation and had 8 SC Croatia players transferred to the Preston club. Radojevic had also hoped to sell the club's Division 1 spot to Makedonia. This decision was met with much anger and caused a split within the club, seeing SC Croatia remain in Geelong playing in Division 1, while Radojevic's breakaway faction played in Melbourne under the name of Preston Croat in the Victorian State League. So for the next three seasons the two clubs remained separate entities. SC Croatia, following the split, having lost the bulk of its squad merged with the Zagreb club from Geelong allowing it to be able to field a side for the season. Despite the controversy of the split, the club's initial years of the 1950s had proven to be overwhelmingly successful, with the club finishing in the top 2 on five occasions in its first 6 seasons. The 1950s saw the club have its highest points per game ratio of any decade in its history , and an impressive 68% win ratio. Preston Croat's inaugural State League season in 1960 ended with the club finishing 2nd to last and relegated to Division 1. In the 1961 season they were undefeated in pursuit of the Division 1 South title and promoted to the top flight for next season. SC Croatia would finish 3rd and only 3 points behind Preston Croat and fail to promote. The 1961 season ended would bring turmoil to the Victorian soccer landscape. VASFA was faced with opposition to how the league was run, and the 12 State League clubs decided to breakaway and join the rebel Victorian Soccer Federation although many clubs playing below the State League, including SC Croatia, initially sided with the VASFA. Preston Croat poach players from SC Croatia; the VSF proved to be a more attractive set-up for players. By February 1962 the VSF gain control of the sport in Victoria when VASFA collapsed and disbanded. All VASFA clubs in Victoria then joined the VSF. The 1962 State League season proved to be difficult for Preston Croat, the club avoided relegation by 2 points. The pre-season 1962 Ampol Cup results gave Preston Croat promise when it made the Semi-Finals. That year saw Preston Croat goalkeeper Ilija Djukic become the club's first representative player, as he was selected in the Victorian state team squad to take on South Australia. SC Croatia on the other hand in 1962 took out the Division 1 title comfortably, winning 19 of its 22 matches. That amazing season saw the debut of club legend Billy Vojtek at the young age of 18. Vojtek had an incredible debut season for SC Croatia as he took out both the club's top goal-scorer and player of year honours. The 1962 season also saw SC Croatia move back to Melbourne, playing out of Tracey's Speedway in Maribyrnong. With both clubs set to compete in the State League in 1963 factions at both clubs saw it as an opportunity for the two clubs to finally re-unite. Many at SC Croatia were still angry over the 1960 incident, but eventually terms were agreed to and the two clubs re-united under the banner of SC Croatia. Despite the high expectations within the Croatian community the club finished a disappointing 11th in its inaugural season as a re-united side in the State League, being relegated back to Division 1. The highlight of the disappointing year was SC Croatia making the semi finals of the Dockerty Cup. At the conclusion of the 1963 season SC Croatia president Enver Begovic and the President of Richmond Allemania took legal action against the VSF, arguing that the decision to relegate their respective clubs was unconstitutional. The courts decision went against the two clubs, seeing both relegated. SC Croatia would quickly return to the State League for the 1965 season after once more winning the Division 1 title in 1964, they lost only one match that season. SC Croatia clinched the 1964 title on the final day against Preston Makedonia. In the lead-up to the pivotal game the team manager Frank Burin travelled to Sydney and arranged for six players from Sydney Croatia to play in the one-off match. Unfortunately the clearance for the players failed to come through on time, though in the end it would not matter in the final outcome. SC Croatia and Makedonia went into the match on equal points, in the thrilling match SC Croatia came out on top defeating Makedonia 3\u20131 in front of 4,000 people at a ground in Port Melbourne. Goals came from Billy Vojtek with a double, and Horst Rau. Notably Northern Irishman Ollie Norris joined the club for the 1964 season. During the 1950s Norris had played in the English Division 1 with Middlesbrough, and was part of the giant killing AFC Bournemouth team of 1957 which made the Quarter Finals of the FA Cup. Norris was the most high-profile player SC Croatia had up until this point in the club's history. Many of the early club legends of SC Croatia played and began their careers during this initial era of the club, the most prominent of these individuals being Bozo Ba\u0161i\u0107, Frank Bot, Billy Vojtek, Jim Vojtek, Mirko Kova\u010dek and Horst Rau."

        "content": "With SC Croatia's return to the State League in 1965 the club would cement itself as one of the states most powerful sides under the guidance, for the most part, of long-time coach Mijo Kis. Between 1965 and 1972, SC Croatia finished in the top 4 five times and won 9 titles. In its three previous seasons in the State League the club had struggled and the 1965 season looked like this would continue with SC Croatia losing 6 of its first 9 matches of the season as relegation was being faced once more. The club president at the time Enver Begovi\u0107 reacted by spending over 5000 pounds to bring in players such as Scottish international Duncan MacKay, Brian Adlam, Hammy McMeechan , Bill McLyntyre, Joe Keenan, Bobby McLachlan and Ian Currie. The club went to great lengths to bring in these players, sending Frank Burin to Scotland to sign the majority of the newcomers. These incredible signings saw the club dubbed the 'Glamour Team' of the State League. In the final 13 matches of the season the club won 10 of the matches and had the best record, picking up the most points, of any team in the State League over that period. They even defeated the top 3 sides, South Melbourne SC, Sunshine George Cross and Brunswick Juventus. Despite all this the club finished 6th as the damage at the start of the season was too much to overcome. Croatia also made the final of the Dockerty Cup for the first time, losing 1\u20130 to Slavia. They defeated their arch rivals Footscray JUST 2\u20131 in the semi-final. In the 1966 season, SC Croatia strengthened its already powerful side, bringing in Jimmy Mackay and Bill MacArthur. The club continued its great form from the second half of the previous season. With 3 games remaining SC Croatia was sitting in 3rd spot, only 2 points behind the first placed South Melbourne SC. Unfortunately SC Croatia crumbled under the pressure, losing all 3 matches to finish fifth and just miss out on the top 4 qualification for the Australia Cup. That year also saw the club when its first cup title as the Reserves side won the Armstrong Cup, defeating rivals Footscray JUST in the final. In 1967 SC Croatia found itself well off the pace after Round 10, sitting in 7th position. But the final 12 matches of the season saw the club rally as it went on an impressive run that saw it only lose 2 of those remaining 12 matches as they climbed all the way up to 3rd spot, its highest league finish. This first ever top 4 finish saw SC Croatia qualify for the prestigious Australia Cup, a national knock-out soccer tournament featuring the 16 best clubs in the country. SC Croatia won its opening round match 2\u20130 away to West Adelaide Hellas at Hindmarsh Stadium. SC Croatia was eventually knocked out in the Quarter-Finals, losing against Brunswick Juventus. In 1968 all the hard work of previous years finally paid off with what was the high point of this era, when SC Croatia won its first Victorian State League championship. Under the captaincy of Horst Rau SC Croatia was dominant winning 15 of its 22 matches, and finishing 7 points clear of the second place Polonia. The club had finally lived up to its tag as the 'Glamour Team'. It was a remarkable achievement particularly given that the club was sitting in 5th position by Round 10, a massive 5 points behind the league leaders at the time Hakoah Melbourne. From that point onwards SC Croatia went undefeated for the rest of the season, winning 10 of the final 12 matches of the season. 1968 also saw SC Croatia win the prestigious Dockerty Cup , as well as the Ampol Cup to complete a remarkable treble. SC Croatia is one of only two sides to ever achieve that treble, the other being Green Gully in 1981. SC Croatia also went on to narrowly lose the Inter City Cup to Hakoah Eastern Suburbs of Sydney 3\u20132 at Olympic Park. Finally in 1968 SC Croatia competed in its second Australia Cup in what would be the last tournament staged. In the opening round SC Croatia faced Adelaide Juventus at Olympic Park, winning 3\u20131. The club's run would end in the Quarter-Finals, losing to eventual tournament Runner-Up Hakoah Melbourne. In the end 1968 proved to be an outstanding season where SC Croatia truly came of age, cementing itself as one of the most powerful clubs in the country. Following the completion of the 1968 season, SC Croatia was part of a consortium of 9 clubs from both Victoria and NSW that announced their intention to organize a 12 team national league to begin in 1969. The proposed league did not eventuate. The following two seasons of 1969 and 1970, while not being as successful as the landmark season of 1968, saw the club continue to consolidate its position as one of Australia's strongest sides despite the loss of key figures from the 1968 side such as Hammy McMeechan, Alfred Glaser, Tommy Friganovic and Robert Symington. SC Croatia finished a respectable 4th in both 1969 and 1970, qualifying for the top 4 State League Cup in both seasons. Croatia also had success in cup competitions in 1969, in the pre-season Ampol Cup SC Croatia lost in the final to South Melbourne Hellas 2\u20131 in front of 15,000 fans at Olympic Park. While the club would go on to defend its Dockerty Cup title in 1969 defeating Brunswick Juventus 3\u20131 in the Final. The back-to-back Dockerty titles were an achievement that at that time had not been achieved by their more fancied and bitter rivals Footscray JUST and South Melbourne Hellas. The 1970 State League season saw an exciting finish in the closing stages for SC Croatia. The final spot in the top 4 cup series was up for grabs between the club and South Melbourne Hellas. With only two matches remaining SC Croatia was in 4th spot on 26 points, while Hellas was in 5th on 24 points. Both the remaining matches would see SC Croatia play Hellas, this was due to the earlier encounter in the season being postponed. Due to Croatia's superior goal difference, Croatia would only need to gain a draw in one of the matches to clinch the top 4 spot. The first clash was contested mid-week and it proved to be a remarkable match which saw Hellas leading 3-1 early in the second half. Croatia bravely fought back, equalising on the 80th minute through Bill McLyntyre to see the match finish 3-3 and ensure a top 4 spot. 1971 was a year that proved to be another highlight for the club. Before the start of the season the club showed itself to be the firm favourites by taking out the Victorian Ampol Cup, defeating bitter rivals Footscray JUST 5\u20131 in the final. The club took this form into the State League season, after round 15 SC Croatia was equal first along with Footscray JUST. Both sides dominated the competition; SC Croatia had won 11 of those matches and lost only 2. But the club capitulated in the final 7 rounds, picking up only 3 points to finish 3rd behind Footscray JUST and South Melbourne Hellas. But SC Croatia got its revenge and proved it was the best side in Victoria by winning the State League Cup, a tournament played at the end of the season featuring the top four sides in the State League. This was very much like the playoffs system but it did not count as an official league championship at the time. SC Croatia defeated South Melbourne SC 3\u20132 in the Grand Final at Olympic Park. 1971 also saw SC Croatia qualify for the Inter City Cup final, which was a match that took place between the respective Victorian and New South Wales Ampol Cup champions. This at the time was the only national club title available. SC Croatia won the Inter City Cup defeating Western Suburbs of Sydney over two legs. The first leg in Melbourne ended in a 1\u20131 draw, but SC Croatia won the second leg in Sydney, defeating Western Suburbs 3\u20131 with a hat-trick from Bill McLyntyre. The win saw SC Croatia hold the unofficial mantle as the best club in the country. They again made the Inter City Cup final the following year, but lost to St George Budapest. SC Croatia lost 4\u20131 in Sydney and 1\u20130 in Melbourne. The strength of the club during this period was particularly shown by a number of its players representing Australia in international football. The first came in 1965 with Hammy McMeechan becoming the club's first international representative. In 1967 Billy Vojtek would follow, becoming the first player of Croatian heritage to play for Australia. In 1970 Jimmy Mackay would become another SC Croatia player to wear the Green and Gold, he became an integral part of Australia's side that went to the 1974 World Cup. Other notable players during this era included Scottish international Duncan Mackay, Bill McLyntyre, Brian Adlam, Hugh Gunn, Bill McArthur, Frank Bot, Ante Ku\u017eelek, Bobby McLachlan, Mirko Kova\u010dek, Welsh international Peter Davies and there was even a short stint from Yugoslavian international Stjepan Lamza during the 1972 season."

        "content": "1972 would be a dark year in SC Croatia's history. On 30 July 1972 SC Croatia played Hakoah at Olympic Park in Round 19 of the VPL. The match was abandoned after the 62-minute mark after SC Croatia supporters invaded the pitch, attacking the match officials following the sending off of SC Croatia player Hugh Gunn. At the VSF Tribunal SC Croatia was found guilty of having failed to control its spectators, the club had its membership with the VSF revoked which saw it kicked out of all competitions. The club appealed the decision, but the punishment stood. It was the first time such a ruling had been handed down in Australian football, the decision saw the club forfeit its final three matches of the season. Before the Hakoah match SC Croatia was sitting in 5th spot, still a chance of making the top 4 State League Cup. SC Croatia felt it had been victimised, with the decision having more to do with politics as accusations of interference were made against Tony Kovac the president of bitter rivals Footscray JUST. That same year North Geelong Croatia was also expelled from the Provisional League by the VSF due to crowd disturbance, casting further doubt on the legitimacy and intent behind the VSF ruling. The VSF as part of their ruling allowed for SC Croatia to apply for re-admission into the VSF after the conclusion of the season, and on 22 August the club sent in their application. After reviewing the application the VSF rejected it, causing further anger within the Croatian community. As a consequence the club chose to go down the legal avenue taking the VSF to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1973, but the club would end up losing the case. Throughout 1973 the club held weekly meetings despite having no side competing, also a SC Croatia old-boys team played friendly matches against local sides. In 1974 club members chose to go down a different path to bring the club back, they set their sights on a take-over of the financially struggling Division 1 club Essendon Lions . The first step occurred with the appointment of the influential SC Croatia figure Tony Vrzina as coach of the Essendon Lions late in the 1974 season, rescuing the club from relegation. With the completion of the season a total take-over of the club took place, with Croatia paying $25,000 to the Lions to take control of the club and the facilities at Montgomery Park in Essendon. By the beginning of the 1975 season Tony Vrzina had become president of the club and Duje Zemunik was appointed coach. The club would become known as Essendon Croatia, though they would continue to play under the Lions name until 1978 when the name was officially changed to Essendon Croatia. Essendon Croatia's time in Division 1 did not see much success for the club, with the most successful season coming in 1976 when the club finished 3rd. That year the club also made the Semi-Finals of the Dockerty Cup where they lost to Polonia. The club's time in Division 1 was marked by re-building, the drop and eventual take over of Essendon Lions saw most of the club's previous State League players leave. But none-the-less the club continued to soldier on. In 1974 the club staged the first 'unofficial' Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament at Montgomery Park with 6 clubs competing; this was a precursor to the official tournament which would take place the following year. Also the club's youth system was producing great young talent during this time that would go on to have a deep influence on Australian football, namely Eddie Krn\u010devi\u0107 and Branko \u010culina. This culminated in the club's Reserve side winning the Division 1 Reserves Championship in 1976. Also during this time the club lost none of its ambition, shown in 1976 with the signings of high-profile State League players such as Nick Kuzmamov, goalkeeper John Kennedy, Ivan Gruicic and the legendary John Gardiner from the George Cross for a then record fee of $6,000."

        "content": "1977 saw the creation of the National Soccer League, four sides from Victoria entered the NSL. This exodus from the State League allowed the return of Essendon Croatia to the top flight of Victorian football after a 4-year absence. 1977 saw the club's favourite son, Billy Vojtek, return to Essendon Croatia to help them get back to the top. The club's first season back was marked by mixed results. The club started the season as one of the favourites after having won the pre-season Ampol Cup, it was the first and only time that a newly promoted side had lifted the trophy. But early season player losses to NSL clubs, Ivan Grui\u010di\u0107 to Canberra City FC and John Gardiner to South Melbourne SC , saw the club have a sluggish start to the State League winning only 2 of its first 12 matches. Club legend Duncan MacKay was brought in as coach, he introduced a number of new players including New Zealand international Brian Davidson and Steve Kokoska from Sunshine City. MacKay's influence had a deep impact with the club having a great second half of the season as Essendon Croatia won 6 of its final 10 matches, to finish a respectable seventh. The club also went on to make the Final of the Dockerty Cup, losing to Brunswick Juventus. It would not be too long before the club once more became one of the top sides in the state. In 1978 the club won its second Victorian State League championship comfortably under the guidance of coach and former club great Bill McArthur; the side won a staggering 17 of its 22 matches. The powerful side was one of the most dominant Victoria had seen, so much so that the club had clinched the title with 3 matches still remaining. That year the club took out the much sought after treble of Ampol Cup, Victorian champions and State League Cup , an achievement which no other club has ever been able to achieve. The club also made the semi-finals of the Dockerty Cup. Essendon Croatia defended its State League title in 1979 under the dual guidance of Duje Zemunik and player-coach John Gardiner. It proved to be a much tighter race than the previous year. Frankston City had led the league comfortably for most of the season, with the completion of round 17 seeing Frankston 5 points ahead of Essendon Croatia who were sitting in 3rd position. In the remaining 5 matches Essendon Croatia went undefeated as it won 4 and drew 1, clinching the league title on a dramatic final day on goal difference over Frankston City. That year Essendon Croatia took out the prestigious treble; State Champions, Dockerty Cup and the State League Cup where it defeated Preston Makedonia 2\u20131. The success was made more remarkable given the club started the 1979 season in turmoil with mass players losses as Yaka Banovic and Eddie Krencevic transferred to National Soccer League clubs, while also losing four other players including Billy Vojtek and Brian Davidson. In its first three seasons back in the State League Essendon Croatia won every title that was available, an incredible come back from a club that was all but dead only a few years earlier. It was a testament to the dedication of the Croatian community. This back to back championship winning side was a powerful one that contained 5 Socceroos; Ken Murphy, Tommy Cumming, Billy Vojtek, Eddie Krn\u010devi\u0107 and Steve Kokoska. Teenage star Eddie Krn\u010devi\u0107 made his senior debut at 16 for the club in 1977. He would become one of Australia's first overseas success stories. Eddie Krn\u010devi\u0107 headed to Europe in 1981, joining Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb, and he would spend nearly 15 years playing across Europe. However the stand out player of the back-to-back winning side was without a doubt the English forward Tommy Cumming who was signed from Sunshine City for $6,500, he won the Player of the Year award in both 78 and 79. From 1980 to 1983, the club painfully finished runner-up on four successive occasions. In 1980 they finished second to Preston Makedonia, managed by former Essendon Croatia boss Brian Edgley, who had been replaced by Duje Zemunik midway through the previous season. Despite having a fantastic season where Essendon Croatia only lost 2 matches . It was a close battle between the two sides for a large part of the season. After round 14 both Essendon Croatia and Preston Makedonia found themselves on equal points with Preston just ahead on goal difference, the following round saw the two sides face off. Preston won the crucial match 1-0 as they pulled away from Essendon Croatia, holding onto top spot for the rest of the season. The next three seasons saw the club finish runner-up to Green Gully each season. The season of 1981 saw Essendon Croatia finish 6 points behind Green Gully, who were now led by player-coach and former Croatia player John Gardiner. It proved to be a season of high frustration for Essendon Croatia with the club going through three different coaches as the high expectations of the club were not being met. The club started the season slowly but soon made up ground as a tight battle ensued with league leaders Green Gully. It was neck and neck until late into the season when Essendon Croatia capitulated following a 2\u20130 defeat at the hands of Green Gully in Round 20. Notably 1981 also saw David Brogan join Essendon Croatia from Croydon City midway through the season, he would go on to become one of the club's most prolific strikers in its long history. In 1982 the club changed its name to Melbourne Croatia. For the 82 season Bill McArthur was at the helm as coach of Melbourne Croatia. The club kicked off the season with an 8 match unbeaten streak. In round 9 the club lost 4\u20132 to main title rivals Green Gully, to record the club's first loss of the season. The solitary loss resulted surprisingly in McArthur's sacking. Up to round 12 the club was on equal points with Green Gully, but inconsistent results would follow for the rest of the season which saw the club fall behind Green Gully by a clear margin. In Round 15 legendary coach Mijo Kiss made a return to the club after an absence of over a decade. Though his return wasn't enough to catch the runaway Green Gully, he was able to hold onto second place and lead the side to a triumphant 4\u20131 win over Green Gully in round 22. The 1982 season saw Josip Biskic make an incredible impact on his debut season, the beginning of a career which would see Biskic end up playing a club record 328 matches. 1983 saw the club came agonisingly close, losing the title by one point. At this stage the point system in the State League was 2 points for a win and 1 for a draw. If it had been done by today's system of 3 points for a win Melbourne Croatia would have won the title on goal difference. That season Melbourne Croatia, now being coached by the returning John Gardiner, led Green Gully on the ladder for the first 19 rounds, being on top of the table for 18 of those weeks. A Round 20 loss to Brunswick Juventus would prove disastrous for the championship hopes of Melbourne Croatia. The club led 2-0 only to have Juventus come back and win 3\u20132, giving Green Gully top spot. Croatia would go on to win all 6 of its remaining matches, but still it wasn't enough. During the period of 1980-1983 Melbourne Croatia would make up for falling short so many times in the League by winning the end of year State League Cup in 1980, 1981 and 1983 where the club gained its sweetest revenge defeating Green Gully 4\u20130 in the Final. The club had further success in cup competitions during this period as it won the Dockerty Cup in 1980 and 1983, and the Ampol Cup in 1980. Also during this period Melbourne Croatia and its sister club Sydney Croatia were controversially denied entry into the NSL despite dominating their respective state competitions. Lesser clubs, with much smaller supporter bases were given priority over the two powerful Croatia clubs. In 1976 Melbourne Croatia was one of seven Victorian clubs to apply for the NSL: the others being Moorolbark, George Cross, Brunswick Juventus, South Melbourne Hellas, Footscray JUST and Fitzroy Alexander. The Australian Soccer Federation stressed the point that neither club would be welcome till they dropped 'Croatia' from their respective names. The same political back stabbing that had caused Melbourne Croatia's expulsion in 1972 still remained in the football hierarchy. Despite the snub from the ASF Melbourne Croatia showed its ability on the national level by participating in the National Soccer League Cup, which was open to the top state league sides for a short period, each year from 1978 to 1981. The club's best performance came in 1978 when the club made it to the Quarter Finals. A notable victory came in the second round where they defeated Beograd, a Serbian backed club from Adelaide, 3\u20130. In the Quarter Finals the club faced NSL side Adelaide City. Melbourne Croatia put up a brave fight, narrowly going down 1\u20130 to their more fancied opponents. Croatia proudly made it to at least the second round each time it participated in the Cup, except for 1980 when it was knocked out in the first round by Heidelberg United. That year Heidelberg United had finished 2nd in the NSL, Croatia once again showed the strength of Victorian State League football by pushing them all the way, eventually losing 3\u20132. The 1980 Ampol Cup victory was also notable for the club's performances against Melbourne's NSL sides. In the semi-final Melbourne Croatia defeated a full strength South Melbourne NSL side 1-0 and then went on to defeat a full strength Heidelberg NSL side in the final 2\u20131. The result so infuriated and caused embarrassment for South Melbourne that the president of South, Sam Papasavas, came out in the local media demanding a re-match with a bet of $5,000. Great players from this era not already mentioned included Peter Blasby, Branko \u010culina, Ante Bilaver, Josip Bi\u0161ki\u0107, Steve Short, Carl Gilder, Steve Gojevi\u0107, Ivan Grui\u010di\u0107, George Hannah, Noel Mitten and Keith Adams."

        "content": "Finally in 1984 economics gave the club what lobbying could not. The NSL had been struggling financially, with dwindling crowds. So as a solution the Federation reverted from a one division competition of 16 teams, to a duel conference set-up with each conference consisting of twelve teams. With the expansion the club could no longer be ignored and entry to the NSL was finally given. For the 1984 season the club had a squad made up mostly of players from their 1983 state league season, including Steve Gojevi\u0107, Josip Biskic, Tommy Cumming, Keith Adams, David Brogan, Peter Blasby and George Hannah. The club had a major coup singing legendary Welsh footballer Terry Hennessey as coach. The club would go on to make an incredible impact on debut, finishing 3rd in the regular season and qualifying for the finals, just showing what a strong side the club had in the State League. The highlight of the regular season was the club's 12 match unbeaten streak, a record for the club in the NSL. But the season didn't start off in such an amazing manner, winning only 3 of its opening 11 matches. Hennessey was sacked after round 9 and the experienced Tony Vrzina came in at round 13 seeing a massive turnaround in the club's fortunes. In the finals, Melbourne Croatia made it to the Major Semi-Final where they faced South Melbourne for a spot in the Conference Grand Final. South Melbourne FC won 3\u20132 in extra-time in a thrilling match in front of 11,000 fans at Olympic Park. It was a painful loss as Melbourne Croatia had led for a large part of the game only to have South Melbourne FC equalise in the closing minutes to take it to extra-time. Melbourne Croatia with a second chance then faced Heidelberg United, again for a spot in the final against South Melbourne FC. Heidelberg United won 3-1 putting an end to Melbourne Croatia's finals campaign. Melbourne Croatia also made the NSL Cup final that season, winning 5 matches in a row before losing to Newcastle KB United in the Final. That year also saw Melbourne Croatia reach the Final of the Buffalo Cup, where it lost 3\u20131 to South Melbourne in front of 13,000 people at Olympic Park. In 1985 under coach Dom Kapetanovic the club would continue its good form again making the finals, but this time being knocked out in the first match by Preston 2\u20131 at Olympic Park in front of 6,000 spectators. 1985 saw the club once again lose the Buffalo Cup Final, this time to Heidelberg in a 5-1 thrashing. And the club would gain revenge against Preston, taking out the Dockerty Cup with a 2\u20130 victory over the Macedonian club. The next three years were very disappointing for the club, they missed out on finals action each season . This was despite some major signings such as in 1987 under Terry Hennessey , when the club signed Socceroos Robbie Dunn and Alan Edward Davidson, Croatian import Branko Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and a major coup in Scottish international Ian Wallace. As well as in 1988 with Socceroos Jeff Olver and Theo Selemidis, and experienced Scotsman Paul Donnelly. But on the park the club still struggled during this period of 1986-1988 despite having one of the strongest squads in the NSL, the club had become the perennial underachievers of the league. So frustrating was this period for the club that over those three seasons Melbourne Croatia had five different coaches. In the 1987 season Melbourne Croatia had been competitive for most of the season, by the end of round 23 the club was in 5th position only two points behind 2nd place. But the club picked up no further points in the remaining 3 rounds of the season as the club fell away to 9th. 1988 was a very similar story, Ian Wallace had taken charge as coach and at the round 19 mark the club was sitting in 6th only a point outside a finals spot. But the club fell out of finals contention as it went on to lose 5 of its final 7 matches. One positive that came out of this period was Mark Talaji\u0107, a product of the club's youth system, who made his debut for the side at only 16 in 1986. He would go on to become a club legend. However this period did see the club have success in cup competitions, dominating the pre-season Buffalo Cup with victories in 1986 and 1987. Rather fittingly the victories came against Heidelberg and South Melbourne respectively, the two clubs to whom Melbourne Croatia had lost to in 1984 and 1985. Those victories in the Buffalo Cup earned the club a spot in the Final for the Ansett Cup against the NSW pre-season Champions. Ironically both years saw Melbourne Croatia take on Sydney Croatia for the Ansett Cup title. In 1986 Melbourne Croatia defeated their Sydney sister club 3\u20131 at Olympic Park in front 8,500 fans. The following year the club again defeated Sydney Croatia, this time 1\u20130 at the St George Stadium in Sydney. In 1988 the club also won the Dockerty Cup in a thrilling Final against South Melbourne, which saw Melbourne Croatia come out on top 4-3 after extra-time. The club was later stripped of the title after a protest by South Melbourne, as Melbourne Croatia had fielded an ineligible player."

        "content": "After those three painful years of non-finals action, 1989 saw the beginning of what can only be described as the golden era of the club. For the next decade the club would make the NSL finals 8 times out of 9 seasons. 1989 was where everything began to click for the club. The club strengthened an already impressive side with imports \u017deljko Ad\u017ei\u0107 and Francis Awaritefe, as well as Ivan Keli\u0107 and Ivan Duzel from sister club St Albans Dinamo. The club had a strong season finishing 4th on the regular season table and making the finals for the first time since 1985. In the Finals the club defeated Preston 2\u20130, which was followed by an agonising 3\u20132 loss to Sydney Olympic in extra time that put an end to Melbourne Croatia's campaign. 1989 also saw Melbourne Croatia finally move away from Olympic Park and move into its own stadium, the Melbourne Croatia Sports Centre in North Sunshine. This move saw a dramatic increase in crowds. For the season 1989/90, Melbourne Croatia continued to impress, strengthening their side with Andrew Marth from Sunshine George Cross. The club finished 3rd in the regular season, just 3 points behind top spot. In the Finals Melbourne Croatia defeated Southe Melbourne in an epic penalty shootout, with a 7-6 scoreline. The club just missed out on making the Grand Final, losing the Preliminary Final to Sydney Olympic. Melbourne Croatia had taken a 1\u20130 lead, only to have Sydney Olympic claw their way back and score the winner 9 minutes from full-time. In 1990/91 the club had its most successful season in the NSL up to that point. With Ken Worden as coach the club won the Minor premiership for the first time after having an amazing season where the club only lost 4 matches. The club clinched the Minor Premiership with a game to spare following an 8-1 thrashing of Wollongong Macedonia, a match where star striker Ivan Kelic scored 6 goals. The club went on to make it to its first Grand Final where they met city rivals South Melbourne FC at Olympic Park in front of over 23,000 fans. It was a match that Melbourne Croatia came agonisingly close to winning. Melbourne Croatia led for most of the match before conceding a later equaliser with only minutes to go. The match went to a penalty shoot out where Melbourne Croatia led 2-1 following South Melbourne FC missing 3 consecutive penalties. Melbourne Croatia had 2 penalty kicks to win the game, missing both and eventually losing the shootout 5\u20134. The 1991/92 season saw the governing body Soccer Australia begin to implement measures to de-ethnicise the NSL and give it more mainstream appeal. Clubs had to replace their ethnic names, which saw Melbourne Croatia change its name to Melbourne CSC. That season saw former club legend and Socceroo Ken Murphy take over as coach. Under his tenure the club won the Minor premiership once more, but again lost the Grand Final on penalties at Olympic Park, this time to Adelaide City. During this period the club continued to produce young talent and introduce them into their side; Mark Sili\u0107 made his debut at 18 for the club in 1990/91, while Oliver Pondeljak made his debut at 19 in 1991/92. The 1992/93 season was a disappointing one, with the club failing to make the finals and finishing in 10th position. A lot of this had to do with the loss of a number of key players; Alan Edward Davidson, Francis Awaritefe, Damian Mori and Branko Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Even with these losses the club still had a strong side that should have done better. The signs were positive early on, after round 7 the club was sitting in third spot only a point off top spot. But after that the season unravelled for the club as it tumbled down the ladder. Former Knights player Branko Culina who was the coach at the time was sacked after 17 matches following the disappointing results. After Culina's sacking the club saw a late resurgence, and by the end of round 22 the club was sitting in 7th position just a point outside a top 6 finals spot. The club fell away from finals contention as it struggled in the remaining 4 matches, only picking up 3 points. Despite the poor season the club saw some positives with even more new talent emerging in Mark Viduka, Steve Horvat, Adrian Cervinski and David Cervinski and Vinko Buljuba\u0161i\u0107, as well as the signing of Fausto De Amicis. In the 1993/94 season Soccer Australia continued with its campaign of de-ethnicising the sport in Australia. They ruled that Melbourne CSC was still too 'ethnic', seeing the club change its name once more, this time to the Melbourne Knights. On the park to remedy the previous years poor display, the Knights looked to Croatia for help, bringing coach Mirko Bazi\u0107 out to Australia. His influence had a major impact as the Knights dominated the season, easily winning its third Minor Premiership 6 points ahead of second place South Melbourne. Future Socceroo captain Mark Viduka made a significant impact that season, at only 18 years of age he finished the season as the NSL's top goal scorer with 17 goals. He became the only player to win the treble of individual awards; Player of the Year, Under 21 Player of the Year and Top Goal-scorer. He achieved all this despite controversially missing 9 matches due to International duty with the Australian Youth team. But the Grand Final saw a repeat of the events of 1991/92, again losing to Adelaide City at Olympic Park. Cruelly it was former Knights player Damian Mori that scored the winner for Adelaide City. It made three Grand Final defeats in 4 years for the Melbourne Knights, earning the club the tag of 'chokers'."

        "content": "1994/95 was the season when the long-awaited breakthrough was made. Once more the club was a dominant force during the season, the side played a style of football that was head and shoulders above the rest. The club started the season on fire, winning its first 7 matches, a record that is yet to be broken. Unfortunately long-time captain Josip Biskic left the club after round 20, signing with Malaysian club Selanagor FA. Coach Mirko Bazi\u0107 using his contacts in Croatia brought in import Kre\u0161imir Maru\u0161i\u0107 to cover the loss, and he had an immediate impact for the club. The club won the Minor Premiership, its fourth in 5 seasons. The Knights had a sluggish start to its finals campaign, losing to Adelaide City over 2 legs. But the club soon made up for it, making the Grand Final after defeating South Melbourne FC 3\u20132 in the Preliminary Final in a thrilling match at Olympic Park, with Mark Viduka scoring a hat-trick. So for the third time the club met Adelaide City in the Grand Final, but this time in Adelaide at Hindmarsh Stadium. The Knights were dominant, winning 2\u20130 with goals from captain Andrew Marth and striker Joe Spiteri. It was an impressive season for the club, claiming the treble that year; the Cup , the Minor Premiership and the League. They were the only side to have achieved the feat until 2009, when A-League side Melbourne Victory also won the domestic treble. The tag of choker was finally put to rest for the Melbourne Knights. Mark Viduka had another phenomenal season, this time scoring 21 goals and once again took out the treble of individual awards. No other player before or since has been such a dominant force on the national competition. But just as in the previous season there was controversy with Viduka missing 4 matches, which crucially including the first 2 matches of the finals series, due to international duty with the Australian Youth team. Following the championship win, the club headed over to Japan for a series of matches against J-League sides. The Knights defeated Jubilo Iwata and more significantly Yokohama Fl\u00fcgels who were the Asian Super Cup champions at the time. The Knights defended its NSL title the following year, despite having lost a number of players during the off-season; Mark Viduka to Dinamo Zagreb, Steve Horvat to Hajduk Split, Kre\u0161imir Maru\u0161i\u0107 also returning to Croatia and the loss of their coach Mirko Bazic. Mirko Bazic was replaced by former Knights player Ian Dobson. These player losses were made up for with emerging talent in Josip \u0160imuni\u0107, Tom Pondeljak, Ante Kova\u010devi\u0107 and Ice Kutlesovski. The 1995/96 season was an extremely tight one, with only 6 points separating first and sixth at the conclusion of the regular season. Melbourne Knights stormed home with 6 wins from its final 7 matches to finish second, only a point behind Minor Premiers Marconi Fairfield. In the finals the Melbourne Knights defeated Marconi over 2 legs, booking a spot in their 5th Grand Final. In the Grand Final the Knights met Marconi again, a match which it would go into missing three of its players due to international duty with the Olyroos; Joe Spiteri, Frank Juric and Danny Tiatto. The club defeated Marconi 2\u20131 at Olympic Park, their first Grand Final win in their home city. The Knights goals were scored by captain Andrew Marth and striker Adrian Cervinski. The final whistle was followed by jubilant celebrations as thousands of Melbourne Knights supporters invaded the pitch and mobbed the players. This back-to-back championship winning side is regarded by many as the greatest club side Australia has seen. Nine of the players would go on to play for the Australia national football team , as well as defender Josip \u0160imuni\u0107 who would go on to play for the Croatia national football team at two World Cups."

        "content": "For the 1996/97 season the de-ethnicising continued under the helm of the Soccer Australia president David Hill, a key decision was the removal of ethnic symbols from club emblems. So the Melbourne Knights had to change their emblem, removing the Croatian Grb that had adorned the club's emblem since 1953. This was also the beginning of the decline of the side, the constant loss of its players began to catch up with the club. For the 1996/97 season the club lost Mark Sili\u0107, Frank Juri\u0107, Fausto De Amicis, Danny Tiatto and Vinko Buljuba\u0161i\u0107, the side was decimated.  But most importantly the club was no longer replenishing its ranks with new talent from its youth set up at the same rate as it had done in the past. As well as the club not being able to compete with the big dollars of the new non-ethnic clubs that would join the league over the next decade; professional clubs like Perth Glory, Parramatta Power and Carlton. These clubs paid huge salaries to players, the traditional clubs like the Melbourne Knights could not compete and they were priced out of the market. Before the start of the season the Knights won the Dockerty Cup, defeating the Altona Magic 4\u20132. The 1996/7 season saw the Knights just scrape into the finals after a come from behind 3\u20131 win against Perth Glory in the last round of the regular season. The finals proved to be too much for the side, as they lost comprehensively to rivals South Melbourne FC over 2 legs. From 1997/98 to the final season of the NSL in 2003/04, the club only made the finals twice. The 1997/98 season saw the return of veterans Ivan Kelic and Alan Edward Davidson, as well as the loss of Josip Simunic to Hamburg SV in Germany, and David \u010cervinski and Lubo Lapsansky to the newly formed Carlton SC. Despite another staggering string of player losses the Knights would still put up a brave fight, going onto narrowly miss the finals that season, losing their crucial final round match against Marconi. The following two seasons were disastrous for a club so used to success, with the club finishing 12th in both seasons. Matters were made worse with captain Andrew Marth leaving the club in 1998/99, going to Carlton SC. He left the Knights due to his frustrations with the recruitment policy of the club, it was a devastating blow to the club. One highlight in this dark period came in the 1999/00 season when English legend Peter Beardsley came out for at two match guest stint at the club. His first match against South Melbourne FC at Knights Stadium attracted a record 11,500 people; unfortunately the side was thrashed 4\u20130. The 2000/01 season was the most successful season during this period, a season that saw the return of championship players Andrew Marth, Steve Horvat and Ljubo Lapsanksy after the early season disbanding of Carlton SC. Coach and club legend Vlado Vanis led the side. He made a number of excellent signings, including forwards Joel Porter and Toto Da Costa. Vanis employed a very attacking style of football, playing 3 strikers; Joel Porter, Toto Da Costa and Adrian Cervinski. They went on to score 36 goals between them. Despite all this Vanis was surprisingly sacked by club president Harry Mrksa late in the season after the two clashed over a number of issues. Andrew Marth took over as player-coach and guided the club to the finals after finishing the regular season in 6th spot. In the finals the Knights took out Perth Glory over two thrilling legs and then narrowly lost to Sydney Olympic to finish the season in an impressive 4th position. The following year the Knights again made the finals, but were once more knocked out by Sydney Olympic over two legs. By 2002/03 the club had once more lost much of their side, the loss of Joel Porter and Toto Da Costa was particularly painful and the club struggled as a consequence in its final 2 seasons in the NSL. There were a few positives such as Anthony Pelikan, who became the club's star player and one of the NSL's leading players during this time. The 2002/03 season also saw the legendary coach Mirko Bazic return from Croatia to take charge of the side for the last 6 matches of that season, which included a 1\u20130 victory over rivals South Melbourne at home in the big derby clash in front of 7,157 spectators. In the final season of the NSL the club finished second last, its worst finish ever in the NSL. Despite the poor finish, 9 of the players from the squad in following years would end up at A-League clubs . The club's final NSL match was fittingly against sister club Sydney United on 29 February 2004. The match was played in front of a crowd of 8,423 at the Melbourne Croatia Sports Centre. It was an incredible atmosphere, a celebration of Croatian football in Australia. The match ended 0-0 and with the final whistle there was a mass pitch invasion by the fans of both clubs. The respective captains, Andrew Marth and Mark Rudan, were chaired off the ground."

        "content": "The NSL was disbanded in 2004 to make way for a new professional league, the A-League. The Melbourne Knights knowing they would not be part of this new league, opted not to bid for a spot in the A-League unlike the other ethnic clubs. The club dropped back to the state league, now called the Victorian Premier League. But the Knights along with South Melbourne FC were not allowed to enter the 2004 VPL season, with various clubs in a campaign led by former Socceroo and JUST player Ernie Tapai at Whittlesea blocking their entry. This was despite assurances from the majority of the VPL clubs prior to the vote that they would vote in support of the entry of the Melbourne Knights into the league. The Knights went to the president of the new Football Federation Australia, Frank Lowy, for help. The club was told by Lowy that he and his organisation were powerless to do anything the help resolve the issue. As a consequence the club went over 12 months with no football and no source of revenue. This placed the club on the brink of financial ruin, so much so that the club was close to selling its stadium. The 12-month in-action also saw the club lose its entire squad on free transfers, including 3 players that went on to join A-League club Melbourne Victory . The club has never been compensated for these losses. For the 2005 VPL season the club finally resumed its football. The Knights had to re-build a squad, creating a difficult first few seasons in the VPL. 2005 saw mixed results for the club as they finished 9th, at one stage challenging for a finals spot before falling away. The 2006 season was disastrous. The side started off brilliantly, leading the competition in the early stages. Then the club was hit by crisis after crisis; board interference in player selection, three coaching changes and a player walkout, which nearly saw the club relegated. On a positive note there was the unearthing of an exciting new talent, Mate Dugand\u017ei\u0107. He made his debut in the senior side at only 16 years of age making an impressive impact. 2007 was the year that saw a turnaround in the fortunes of the Melbourne Knights. Chris Taylor was appointed coach and strong recruiting by the club, including the signing of former NSL stars Steve Iosifidis and Joe Spiteri, saw the club go into the season with high hopes. Despite this it was a mixed start to the season for the club, only winning 2 of its opening 8 games. Soon after the club made 3 key signings; former Knights NSL player Anthony Pelikan from Oakleigh, 2006 under 21 VPL player of the year Daniel Visevic from Richmond and up-and-coming player Cameron Watson who had spent time at Portugal's FC Porto. These signings saw the club storm home, winning 7 of its final 9 matches and finishing second on the ladder, a point behind the Preston Lions. In the finals the club lost to Preston, 1\u20130, in a tightly fought affair with Preston scoring the winner late in the game. The Knights then took on Oakleigh to keep their title hopes alive.  The club proved their class with a strong 1\u20130 win. Finally the Melbourne Knights once more faced off against Preston, this time for a spot in the Grand Final against Whittlesea. The club lost 2\u20131 in a controversial match at Bob Jane Stadium. Anthony Pelikan was sent off just before half time, receiving a second yellow card for simulation. The Knights put on a brave performance in the second half. But a late strike from Preston against the run of play killed the game off despite a consolation goal deep in injury time. Overall it was a successful year for the club, finishing 3rd in what was the club's highest league finish in well over a decade. Also the club went on to win the under 21 and under 18 Victorian titles. 2008 season saw the club aim high once more. There were a number of changes in the squad, with Mate Dugandzic and Daniel Visevic being signed by Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb, and influential goalkeeper Adrian Cagalj transferring to Oakleigh. Players brought into the club included the return of Andrew Barisic from a year stint in Germany. A stellar start to the season saw the Knights go on a club record in the state league with a 19 match unbeaten streak, seeing the club lead the league for a large part of the season. But injuries late in the campaign took their toll bringing the unbeaten streak to an end, with the side's midfield being decimated by the loss of Anthony Pelikan, Ivan Franjic and Cameron Watson, as well as the early season injury of influential captain Tom Milardovic. Eventually the Knights finished second just a point behind Minor Premiers Green Gully. In the opening game of the finals the Knights took on Green Gully. The match ended 1-1 after extra time with the Knights taking out the match on penalties. Knights then took on the Altona Magic for a spot in the Grand Final. The match at Knights Stadium once more saw the game finish 1-1 and go to penalties. But it was Altona that took it out 4\u20133. Knights with a second chance at a Grand Final spot took on Heidelberg United, the Knights proved too strong winning 2\u20131. The Grand Final, the club's first in 12 years, took place at Bob Jane Stadium in front of 5,500 mostly Knights fans. The club went into the match still missing influential players Franjic and Pelikan, as well as striker Joe Spiteri missing the game due to suspension. It was a game that the Knights dominated, creating many chances but failing to convert them. The match finished 0-0 after 90 minutes and moved into extra match. With the match poised to go to penalties Altona snatched victory with barely a minute left in the match. One piece of consolation came with captain Craig Elvin winning the Jimmy Rooney man of the match award. Also striker Andrew Barisic had a stellar season scoring 19 goals, the most by a Knights player since Mark Viduka in 1994/95. The 2009 VPL season started with a mass exodus of players, this most notably included Andrew Barisic to new A-League franchise Gold Coast United, as well as veterans Joe Spiteri and Steve Iosifidis dropping to lowers leagues to finish off their careers. A number of new recruits were brought in, with a strong focus on youth, which saw players brought from the reserves into the senior squad and a handful of players from the Melbourne Victory FC Youth team. The side was strengthened with the signings of a few more experienced players, such as Mate Dugandzic who returned from his stint in Croatia. The first half of the season was disastrous for the Knights, picking up 11 points from just as many matches as they sat third from bottom. The second half of the season saw a marked improvement from the club, as they came within throwing distance of the top 5 only to fall away late in the season. The 2010 season will best remembered for activities off the field which saw the monumental return of the Grb to the Melbourne Knights emblem after an absence of almost 15 years, with the club reverting to the emblem proudly worn during its back-to-back NSL championships of the mid 90s. The return to the classic emblem was most fitting as the club celebrated the 15th anniversary of those championships, gathering all of the players from that legendary side for a successful gala night and reunion match. On the field the 2010 VPL season proved to be an unsuccessful one. The year began with a complete clean out of players; only 3 players remained from the 2009 squad. The club had not seen such a clean out since it dropped out of the NSL in 2004. The task of re-building the side fell to former Knights player Ivan Duzel who took over from Chris Taylor as coach. What was implemented was a recruitment policy that saw a diverse range of players brought to the Knights, including imports such as the American-Croat Tomislav Skara, Englishman Kevin Townson and Frenchman Jean-Charles Dubois. Also there was the return of club legend Danny Tiatto, returning to finish off his career at the Knights. The season itself was marred by inconsistency from the Knights as the club struggled and found itself near the bottom of the table for most of the season. With only 3 matches remaining the club was on the brink of relegation as it sat inside the bottom two. But the Knights ensured their placed in the VPL as it recorded its two most important victories of the season, defeating Bentleigh Greens 2\u20130 away and a 4\u20132 victory at home against Northcote City. After the season the club won a number of individual awards with Kevin Townson awarded the media voted Player of the Year award, while finishing runner-up for the Gold Medal VPL Player of the Year award. Adrian Zahra won the Under 21 Player of the Year award, soon after he was signed by A-League club Melbourne Heart. The post-season gave some cause for celebration as the club took out the Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament in New Zealand, only the second time the club had won the cup. In early 2011, the Knights took out the Victorian Croatian Cup, after defeating North Geelong Warriors FC 4\u20130 in the final. Around 800 people were in attendance, with fundraising actions in place to help sister club Rocklea United after their clubrooms were flooded in Queensland. After a disappointing start to the 2011 VPL season, assistant coach Paul Magdic took over the head job, replacing Ivan Duzel who had been asked to step down. The tough season ended with a bitterly disappointing 10th-placed finish. Some relief was found in the Knights' Mirabella Cup run, where the club dispatched the likes of Oakleigh Cannons FC and Green Gully SC on their way to the final, but lost 2\u20130 at Melbourne's AAMI Park to Northcote City FC. The Knights confirmed back to back Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament titles in October 2011, as the 37th edition of the event was held at Kralj Tomislav in Sydney. The club relieved Paul Magdic of his duties as head manager in mid-2012, replacing him with club legends Andrew Marth and Frank Juric, the former taking the head role and the latter the assistant's role. Marth led the club on a mini-revival, taking the Knights away from relegation but not enough to book a finals berth. The Melbourne Knights officially launched a sports gym on 3 March 2013. The newly constructed gym, located behind the Mark Viduka stand at Knights Stadium, is a fully equipped boxing, weight and cardio facility. The 2013 season was a welcome change for the Knights, finishing in second place in the regular season, but went down initially to Bentleigh Greens SC in the qualifying final and then to bitter rivals South Melbourne 1\u20130 in the semi-final. The South Melbourne derby was played in-front of 5,000 supporters at Knights Stadium. The bumper crowd was the result of the match falling in the middle of the Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament hosted by the Knights. Marijan Cvitkovic took out the VPL's best-and-fairest player for 2013 as Melbourne Knights celebrated their 60th year of existence in style. National Premier Leagues Victoria and FFA Cup In 2014, the Knights' squad was decimated by injuries in the first half of the season and struggled for results. A resurgence in the second half of the season saw the club pick up more points than most of the clubs above it to finish in 5th place. The major achievement was winning the 2014 Dockerty Cup, beating South Springvale in the final through a 121st-minute goal from captain Tomislav Uskok. On the way to the final, Melbourne beat rivals South Melbourne in the quarter finals in a riveting contest. The club also qualified for the inaugural 2014 FFA Cup through their progression in the Dockerty Cup, but were knocked out by Olympic FC in the Round of 32 in a contentious affair. The 2015 season saw the club qualify for the newly re-introduced league finals series after a strong league showing, finishing in 4th place. The Knights exited the finals series at the first stage, though, going down on penalties to Hume City FC. In the penalty shoot-out, Hume City keeper Chris Oldfield saved all four of Croatia's penalty kicks. At the club's end of season awards night, talismanic striker Stipo Andrija\u0161evi\u0107 took out the 2015 Best & Fairest and 2015 Top Goalscorer awards. Andrija\u0161evi\u0107's incredible long distance volley into the top corner against Green Gully SC on 18 July was voted as the best goal in the NPL Victoria. Wth youth product, captain and fan-favourite Tomislav Uskok signing for A-League side Central Coast Mariners in November, 2015 Knights re-signed the majority of their players from the previous season. Established goalkeeper Chris May and long serving full back Anthony Colosimo departed and in came young talents like 18-year-old Nick Glavan and 17-year-old Nikola Jurkovi\u0107 from Melbourne Victory Youth and sister-club North Geelong Warriors respectively. Melbourne Knights finished the NPL Victoria season in ninth place, missing out on a finals spot. However, the Somers Street-based side qualified for the national stage of the 2016 FFA Cup following a 2\u20130 victory over Port Melbourne SC. Knights drew Western Australian side Cockburn City SC, defeating them 2\u20131 at Knights Stadium. In the Round of 16, at home once more, Melbourne Knights lost 3\u20131 to Green Gully in front of 2,472 fans. After a disappointing first half of the 2017 season, head coach Andrew Marth and assistant Frank Juri\u0107 were relieved of their coaching duties with the club languishing in third-bottom place and out of the FFA Cup in the qualifying stages, losing to NPL Victoria 2 side Dandenong City. Former Port Melbourne coach Eric Vassiliadis was announced as the new head coach on 21 May 2017. Vassiliadis lasted just 35 days in the role before he was relieved of his duties, gaining one point in five matches in his time as head coach. Croatia finished in 12th place with 24 points, its lowest points total since returning to Victorian state football in 2005. The 12th-place finish meant Knights had to play in the promotion-relegation playoff match, coming up against fellow Croatian-backed side Dandenong City for the second time that season. A Kym Harris hat-trick secured a 3\u20132 win for Melbourne Knights on the day and survival in the NPL Victoria. In the post-season, a change in board saw a change in senior team management, with Knights securing former Croatian international Aljo\u0161a Asanovi\u0107 as the head coach, with Dean Ra\u010dunica his assistant. The appointment of Asanovi\u0107, a World Cup bronze medal winner in 1998, and Ra\u010dunica, was hailed as arguable the biggest coaching coup in the history of the NPL Victoria. Uskok also returned to the club. Knights finished the 2018 National Premier Leagues Victoria season in ninth place, four points adrift of a finals spot. Marijan Cvitkovic, Nate Foster and Uskok all finished the season with eight goals. Croatia won the 2018 Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament, hosted by Gold Coast Knights, beating North Geelong 3\u20130 in the final. After the conclusion of the season, Asanovi\u0107 and Ra\u010dunica departed the club to take up an opportunity in Saudi Arabia, joining Slaven Bili\u0107 at Al-Ittihad. The club promoted Micky Colina, the club's u20s coach, to take over the senior head manager role for 2019. On 25 May 2019, the club announced that it had parted ways with Micky Colina as head coach of the first team along with his assistant Steve Gojevic. Marijan Cvitkovi\u0107 was appointed as player-coach for the remainder of the 2019 season. Knights qualified for the 2019 FFA Cup, managing impressive wins over league-leaders Avondale FC and old foes South Melbourne in the qualifying stages. Melbourne Knights were drawn against A-League side Adelaide United FC in the Round of 32, ultimately going down 5\u20132 in the clash played in front of 4,078 fans at Knights Stadium. 4 days later, a second cup run came to an end for the Knights, losing 1\u20130 to Hume City in the 2019 Dockerty Cup final."

His play during the 2007\u201308 season was limited playing mainly with the club's Championnat de France amateur team and the under-18 squad. He was subsequently promoted to the senior team for the 2008\u201309 season. However, he wasn't assigned a number, and again, played on the club's CFA team. He appeared in 30 matches, scoring 4 goals and helping the side finish 1st among professional clubs in their group, thus qualifying for the playoffs, where they lost to Lyon in the semi-finals. He made his professional d\u00e9but for Rennes on the final matchday of the 2008\u201309 season appearing as a substitute in the club's 4\u20130 defeat to Marseille. On 3 August 2009, Rennes agreed to send Camara on loan to Ligue 2 club Vannes OC for the entire season. He was given the first-team number 9 shirt and made his d\u00e9but in the club's opening league match against Metz, appearing as a substitute in a match that Vannes won 3\u20130. He played 37 league matches, scoring 4 goals. Camara returned to Rennes for the 2010\u201311 season but only played intermittently, also playing 8 matches for the B team, scoring 3 goals."

In the 1985\u201386 season, however, as the starter suffered a severe injury in the first La Liga game, he was chosen by manager John Toshack as his successor, and the Basques eventually finished in seventh position but with one of the worst defensive records in the competition . In the 1986 summer, Elduayen signed with fellow top flight club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, starting in his first year but being relegated to the substitutes bench after the emergence of Abel Resino, who had been playing with the reserves. He experienced his best years with Real Burgos CF, helping the lowly Castile and Le\u00f3n side to three consecutive seasons in the first division. In 1991\u201392, as they finished in a best-ever ninth position, he played in all 38 games and only conceded 43 goals, winning the Don Bal\u00f3n Award for Best Spanish Player in the process. In 1993, after Burgos relegation, Elduayen signed for Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a for about 1 million pesetas. With Francisco Lia\u00f1o firmly established as first-choice for Super Depor, he could only appear three times in the league in three seasons combined, subsequently leaving for Real Valladolid, where he met exactly the same fate in exactly the same period of time, retiring from the game at the age of 35. Having spent 16 seasons in Spain's top division, Elduayen appeared in 179 games. Whilst at Burgos he was summoned by manager Vicente Miera to the Spanish national team, but eventually did not make his debut."

On 21 April 2019, he scored with a tap-in in a 2\u20131 away win against Panetolikos, but he didn't celebrate as a token of appreciation for his old club."

        "content": "The St. Louis Blues are a professional ice hockey team based in St. Louis. The Blues compete in the National Hockey League as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the six teams from the 1967 NHL expansion and is named after the W. C. Handy song \"Saint Louis Blues\". They play their home games at the 19,150-seat Enterprise Center in downtown St. Louis, which has been their arena since moving from St. Louis Arena in 1994. The Blues won the Stanley Cup in 2019 and have the most Stanley Cup playoff appearances outside of the Original Six. Although perennial postseason contenders for most of their history, the franchise frequently struggled in the playoffs, including consecutive Stanley Cup Finals defeats at the end of their first three seasons. With the Blues' victory in their fourth Stanley Cup Finals, 49 years after their last appearance and in their 52nd year of existence, they became the final active team from the 1967 expansion to win their first Stanley Cup. The Blues have a rivalry with the Chicago Blackhawks, with whom they have shared a division since 1970, except in 2021 when they were separated for 1 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Springfield Thunderbirds of the American Hockey League is the team's minor league affiliate."

        "content": "Beginnings and Stanley Cup Finals' appearances The Blues were one of the six teams added to the NHL in the 1967 expansion, along with the Minnesota North Stars, Los Angeles Kings, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and California Seals. St. Louis was the last of the six expansion teams to gain entry into the League; the market was chosen over Baltimore at the insistence of the Chicago Black Hawks. The Black Hawks' owners, James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz, also owned the decrepit St. Louis Arena. They sought to unload the arena, which had not been well-maintained since the 1940s, and thus pressed the NHL to give the franchise to St. Louis, which had not submitted a formal expansion bid. The Black Hawks owners felt they could establish a \"lovable loser\" with the St. Louis Hockey Team. NHL president Clarence Campbell said during the 1967 expansion meetings, \"We want a team in St. Louis because of the city's geographical location and the fact that it has an adequate building.\" The team's first owners were insurance tycoon Sid Salomon Jr., his son, Sid Salomon III, and Robert L. Wolfson, who were granted the franchise in 1966. Sid Salomon III convinced his initially wary father to make a bid for the team. Former St. Louis Cardinals great Stan Musial and Musial's business partner Julius \"Biggie\" Garagnani were also members of the 16-man investment group that made the initial formal application for the franchise. Garagnani would never see the Blues franchise take the ice, as he died from a heart attack on June 19, 1967, less than three months before the Blues played their first preseason game. Upon acquiring the franchise in 1966, Salomon then spent several million dollars on extensive renovations for the 38-year-old arena, expanding it from 12,000 seats to 15,000. Lynn Patrick initially served as general manager and head coach. However, he resigned as head coach in late November after recording a 4\u201313\u20132 record. He was replaced by assistant coach Scotty Bowman, who thereafter led the team to a winning record for the rest of the season. Like the other five expansion teams, the Blues' roster consisted primarily of castoffs from the Original Six and players who had previously never managed to break out of the minor leagues. As part of the expansion, the NHL had agreed to put all of the expansion teams in the new Western Division, an arrangement which was intended to ensure all of the new teams all had an equal chance of reaching the playoffs. Under the expansion playoff format, Bowman's leadership was enough as the Blues qualified for the playoffs in their inaugural season. Although they had finished in third place, St. Louis was regarded as fairly evenly matched with the other three Western qualifiers since only four points separated first and fourth place. Ultimately, it was the Blues who prevailed by winning in seven games each over the Philadelphia Flyers and Minnesota North Stars to reach the  Stanley Cup Finals. However, St. Louis was swept in their first Finals appearance by the heavily favored Montreal Canadiens. Under Bowman, the Blues dominated the West for the next two seasons, becoming the only expansion team to compile a winning record, and they captured division titles by wide margins each year. However, they were swept in the Stanley Cup Finals by the Montreal Canadiens in 1969 and then by the Boston Bruins in 1970. While the first Blues teams included fading veterans like Doug Harvey, Don McKenney and Dickie Moore, the goaltending tandem of veterans Glenn Hall and Jacques Plante proved more durable, winning a Vezina Trophy in 1969 behind a sterling defense that featured players like skilled defensive forward Jim Roberts, team captain Al Arbour and hardrock brothers Bob and Barclay Plager. Phil Goyette won the Lady Byng Trophy for the Blues in 1970 and New York Rangers castoff Red Berenson became the expansion team's first major star at center. The arena quickly became one of the loudest buildings in the NHL, a reputation it maintained throughout its tenure as the Blues' home. During that time, Salomon gained a reputation throughout the NHL as the top players' owner. He gave his players cars, signed them to deferred contracts and treated them to vacations in Florida. The players, used to being treated like mere commodities, felt the only way they could pay him back was to give their best on the ice every night. Financial problems, near-relocation, and playoff streak The Blues' successes in the late 1960s, however, did not continue into the 1970s. The Stanley Cup playoff format changed in such a way that a Western team was no longer guaranteed a Finals berth, and also the Chicago Black Hawks were moved into the Western Division following the 1970 expansion. The Blues lost Bowman, who left during the 1970\u201371 season following a power-sharing dispute with Sid Salomon III , as well as Hall, Plante, Goyette and ultimately Berenson, who were all lost to retirement or trade. Veteran player Al Arbour hastily stepped in to coach the team. Under Arbour, the Blues essentially matched their 1969-70 regular season performance in their fourth season, and were still the best of the expansion teams; however, it was only good enough for second place in the West as St. Louis finished twenty points behind Chicago. The Blues would go on to be upset by the North Stars in six games, thus failing to advance past the first round for the first time in franchise history. Arbour, who officially retired as a player after the 1970\u201371 season, would remain behind the Blues' bench for the next two seasons. The Berenson trade did bring then-Detroit Red Wings star center Garry Unger, who ultimately scored 30 goals in eight consecutive seasons while breaking the NHL's consecutive games played record. Defensively, however, the Blues were less than stellar and saw Chicago and the Philadelphia Flyers overtake the Division. After missing the playoffs for the first time in 1973\u201374, the Blues ended up in the Smythe Division after a League realignment. This division was particularly weak, and in 1976\u201377, the Blues won it while finishing five games below .500, though this would be their last playoff appearance in the decade. In the meantime, the franchise was on the brink of financial collapse. This was partly due to the pressures of the World Hockey Association , but mostly the result of financial decisions made when the Salomons first acquired the franchise. The deferred contracts came due just as the Blues' performance began to slip. At one point, the Salomons cut the team's staff down to three employees. One of them was Emile Francis, who served as team president, general manager and head coach. In hopes of saving the franchise, Francis persuaded St. Louis-based pet food giant Ralston Purina to buy the team, arena, and the $8.8 million debt. The Salomons sold the Blues to Ralston on July 27, 1977. However, longtime Ralston Purina chairman R. Hal Dean said that he only intended to keep the Blues as a Ralston subsidiary only temporarily until a more stable owner could be found who would keep the team in St. Louis. Ralston renamed the arena the \"Checkerdome.\" After two awful years, including what is still a franchise-worst 18\u201350\u201312 record with 48 points in 1979, the Blues made the playoffs the following year, the first of 25 consecutive postseason appearances. After being one of the worst teams a couple of years before, they were one of the best in 1981, as they finished with a then-franchise-best record of 45\u201318\u201317 record which translated to 107 points and the second-best record in the league. Ten players reached at least 20 goals, including Wayne Babych, future Hall of Famer Bernie Federko, and team captain Brian Sutter. They also had strong goaltending led by Mike Liut. They would get rewarded as head coach Red Berenson won the Jack Adams Award, Mike Liut finished a close second to Wayne Gretzky in the Hart Trophy voting, and earned the top spot on the NHL All-Star Team, Larry Patey finished third in the Frank J. Selke Trophy voting, and Blake Dunlop won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Their regular-season success, however, did not transfer into the playoffs, as they were eliminated by the New York Rangers in the second round 2\u20134 after beating the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round 3\u20132. The Blues would underachieve greatly the following year as they posted a 32\u201340\u20138, but they beat the Winnipeg Jets 3\u20131 in the Norris Division Semi-Finals before dropping to the Chicago Black Hawks in the Norris Division 2\u20134. While the Blues had returned to respectability on the ice, they were struggling off it. Ralston Purina lost an estimated $1.8 million a year during its six-year ownership of the Blues. However, Dean took the losses philosophically, having taken over out of a sense of civic responsibility. In 1981, Dean retired. His successor, William Stiritz, wanted to refocus on the core pet food business, and his personal sporting interests were in horse racing and not hockey. He saw the Blues as just another money-bleeding division, and put the team on the market. While there were a number of interested parties, none had enough cash to meet Ralston's asking price. On January 12, 1983, Batoni-Hunter Enterprises Ltd., led by WHA and Edmonton Oilers founder Bill Hunter, tendered an offer to buy the team. He intended to build a $43 million 18,000-seat arena in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in time for the 1983-84 season. While the fans were stunned, the players were aware of this. As the Blues faced the Oilers on December 7, 1982; brochures were distributed saying \"Saskatchewan in the NHL\". These distractions would greatly affect their performance as they squeezed into the playoffs with a 25\u201340\u201315 record in the 1983 season, good enough for 65 points. This led to a Norris Division semi-finals exit against the Chicago Black Hawks. Following their playoff exit, Ralston authorized the deal to Hunter's renamed company Coliseum Holdings, Ltd. for $12 million on April 21. Emile Francis would call it quits on May 2, leaving for the Hartford Whalers to become president and general manager. The Blues then fired 60 percent of their employees. The remaining staff included the accounting department, scouting staff, and coach Barclay Plager. They waited for an authorization by 75% of the NHL Board of Governors for the sale and transfer of the club. However, the NHL Board of Governors rejected the deal by a 15\u20133 vote on May 18, feeling that Saskatoon was not big enough or financially stable enough to support an NHL team. Ralston then filed a $60 million anti-trust lawsuit in U.S. District Court, claiming that the NHL broke federal antitrust laws and breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing by voting to reject the sale and transfer of the Blues to Hunter's group. They also requested that the court allow them to give up the team and bar the NHL from interfering with the sale of the team. On June 3, Ralston announced that it had no interest in running the team anymore. Because they were not required to participate in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, they did not send a representative, which led the Blues to forfeit their picks. The day after the draft, the NHL filed a $78 million counter-suit against Ralston, accusing Ralston of \"damaging the league by willfully, wantonly and maliciously collapsing its St. Louis Blues hockey operation.\" The NHL also said that Ralston broke a league rule that an owner had to give two years' notice before dissolving a franchise. Ralston called the counter-suit \"ridiculous\" and gave the NHL an ultimatum: if the NHL would not accept Hunter's offer by June 14, Ralston would dissolve the team and sell its players and assets to other teams. The Board of Governors rejected the offer and \"terminated\" the team on June 13, one day before Ralston's supposed deadline. It then took control of the franchise and began searching for a new owner. League president John Ziegler said they would try to keep the team in St. Louis. However, had the league not found a new owner by August 6, it would dissolve the team and hold a dispersal draft for the players. On July 27, 1983, ten days before the deadline, the NHL approved a bid from businessman Harry Ornest and a group of St. Louis-based investors for the team and the arena. Ornest had made plans to buy the team as early as March, but built up his efforts in late June to have enough money. Ornest immediately reverted the name of the team's home venue to the St. Louis Arena. To date, this is the closest that an NHL team has come to folding since the Cleveland Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars after the 1977\u201378 season. Ornest ran the Blues very cheaply, though the players did not mind. According to Sutter, they wanted to stay in St. Louis because it reminded them of the rural Canadian towns where many of them grew up. For instance, Ornest asked many players to defer their salaries to help meet operating costs, but the players always got paid in the end. During most of Ornest's tenure, the Blues had only 26 players under contract\u201323 in St. Louis, plus three on their farm team, the Montana Magic. Most NHL teams during the mid-1980s had over 60 players under contract. Despite operating on a shoestring, the Blues remained competitive even though they never finished more than six games over .500 in Ornest's three years as owner. During this time, Doug Gilmour, drafted by St. Louis in 1982, emerged as a star. While the Blues remained competitive, they were unable to keep many of their young players. More often than not, several of the Blues' emerging stars ended up as Calgary Flames, and the sight of Flames executive Al MacNeil was always greeted with dread. In fact, several of the Blues' young stars, such as Rob Ramage, Joe Mullen and Gilmour, were main cogs in the Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup win. Sutter and Federko were the only untouchables on the Blues during that era. By 1986, the team reached the Campbell Conference Finals against the Flames. Doug Wickenheiser's overtime goal in Game 6 to cap a furious comeback remains one of the greatest moments in team history , but the Blues lost Game 7, 2\u20131. Years later, Sutter argued that had the Blues made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, they would have likely beaten the Canadiens, having won two out of three games against the Habs in the regular season. After that season, Ornest sold the team to a group led by St. Louis businessman Michael Shanahan. Brett Hull era St. Louis kept chugging along through the late 1980s and early 1990s. General manager Ron Caron made astute moves, landing forwards Brett Hull, Adam Oates and Brendan Shanahan, defenseman Al MacInnis and goaltender Curtis Joseph, among others. While the Blues contended during this time period, they never passed the second round of the playoffs. Nonetheless, their on-ice success was enough for a consortium of 19 companies to buy the team. They also provided the capital to build the Kiel Center , which opened in 1994. Hull, nicknamed the \"Golden Brett\" , became one of the League's top stars and a scoring sensation, netting 86 goals in 1990\u201391 en route to earning the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player. Hull's 86 goals set the record for most goals in a single season by a right-winger . Only Wayne Gretzky found the net more than Hull during any given three-year period. Despite posting the second-best regular-season record in the entire league in 1990\u201391, the Blues were upset in the second round of the playoffs to the Minnesota North Stars, a defeat that was symbolic of St. Louis' playoff struggles. Mike Keenan was hired as both general manager and coach before the abbreviated 1995 season, with the hope that he could end the postseason turmoil that Blues fans had endured for years. Keenan instituted major changes, including trades that sent away fan favorites Brendan Shanahan and Curtis Joseph, as well as the acquisition of the legendary-but-aging Wayne Gretzky and goaltender Grant Fuhr, both from the declining Los Angeles Kings. During the season, he publicly criticized Gretzky, who entered free agency after the season, declined an offer from the Blues, and took a less lucrative contract with the New York Rangers. Ultimately, Keenan's playoff resume with St. Louis included a first-round exit in 1995 and a second-round exit in 1996, and he was fired on December 19, 1996. Caron was reinstated as interim general manager for the rest of the season, and general manager Larry Pleau was hired on June 9, 1997. Hull, who had a lengthy feud with Keenan, left for the Dallas Stars in 1998. He went on to win the Stanley Cup with the Stars the next year, scoring a controversial goal on the Buffalo Sabres' Dominik Hasek to clinch the Cup for Dallas. The Blues ended the 1990s as the only NHL team to make the playoffs for the entire decade, although a Stanley Cup title still eluded the franchise. End of the playoff streak, lockout, and rebuild Defenseman Chris Pronger , Keith Tkachuk, Pavol Demitra, Pierre Turgeon, Al MacInnis and goaltender Roman Turek kept the Blues a contender in the NHL. In 1999\u20132000, the team notched a franchise-record 114 points during the regular season, earning the Presidents' Trophy for the League's best record. However, they were stunned by the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2000 playoffs in seven games. In 2001, the Blues advanced to the Western Conference Finals before bowing out in five games to the eventual champions, the Colorado Avalanche. Nonetheless, the team remained competitive for the next three years, despite never advancing beyond the second round. Despite years of mediocrity and the stigma of never being able to \"take the next step,\" the Blues were a playoff presence every year from 1980 to 2004 \u2013 the third-longest streak in North American professional sports history . However, they never made an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. In fact, they made it to the conference finals only two times in their streak . Amid several questionable personnel moves and an unstable ownership situation, the Blues finished the 2005\u201306 season with their worst record in 27 years. They missed the playoffs for only the fourth time in franchise history. Moreover, for the first time in club history, the normally excellent support seen by St. Louisans began decrease, with crowds normally numbering around 12,000, notably less than the team's normal high . Wal-Mart heir Nancy Walton Laurie and her husband Bill purchased the Blues in 1999. On June 17, 2005, the Lauries announced that they would sell the team. Bill Laurie, a former point guard at Memphis State University, had long desired to buy and move a National Basketball Association team to St. Louis , and it was thought that this desire caused him to neglect the Blues. On September 29, 2005, it was announced that the Lauries had signed an agreement to sell the Blues to SCP Worldwide, a consulting and investment group headed by former Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts. On November 14, 2005, the Blues announced that SCP Worldwide had officially withdrawn from negotiations to buy the team. On December 27, 2005, it was announced that the Blues had signed a letter of intent to exclusively negotiate with General Sports and Entertainment, LLC. However, after the period of exclusivity, SCP entered the picture again. On March 24, 2006, the Lauries completed the sale of the Blues and the lease to the Savvis Center to SCP and TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P., a private equity firm. The Blues are currently the only team in the four major North American sports to be owned by a private equity firm. Following the disappointing 2005\u201306 season, which saw the Blues with the worst record in the NHL, the new management focused on rebuilding the franchise. Under new management, the Blues promptly installed John Davidson as president of hockey operations, moving Pleau to a mostly advisory role. The former New York Rangers goaltender promptly made multiple blockbuster deals, picking up Jay McKee, Bill Guerin and Manny Legace from free agency, and bringing Doug Weight back to St. Louis after a brief stopover in Carolina. Weight was again traded in December 2007 to the Anaheim Ducks, along with a minor league player, in exchange for Andy McDonald. At the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season, the Blues looked to be competitive in the Central Division. However, injuries plagued the team all season, and the lack of a bona fide scorer hampered them as well. Fan support was sluggish during the first half of the campaign, and the end of the calendar year was capped by an 11-game losing streak. On December 11, 2006, the Blues fired head coach Mike Kitchen and replaced him with former Los Angeles Kings head coach Andy Murray. Davidson also installed a strong development program under head scout Jarmo Kekalainen, using the team's raft of high draft picks in 2006 and 2007 to select highly touted prospects such as T. J. Oshie, Erik Johnson and David Perron. On January 4, 2007, the Blues had a record of 6\u20131\u20133 in their previous ten games, which was the best in the NHL during that stretch. Despite a healthy 24-point jump from the previous season, the strain of playing in a conference where seven teams finished with more than 100 points kept them out of the playoffs for the second year in a row. Just before the 2007 NHL trade deadline, the Blues traded several key players, including Bill Guerin, Keith Tkachuk and Dennis Wideman, in exchange for draft picks, though they re-signed Tkachuk after the season ended. Brad Boyes, picked up from the Boston Bruins in exchange for Wideman, became the fastest Blues player to reach 40 goals since Brett Hull, doing so during the 2007\u201308 season. During the 2007 off-season, the Blues signed free agent Paul Kariya to a three-year contract worth $18\u00a0million, re-signed defenseman Barret Jackman to a one-year contract, lost their captain Dallas Drake to the Detroit Red Wings, and traded prospect Carl Soderberg to the Bruins in exchange for yet more depth in the goal crease, Hannu Toivonen. On October 2, 2007, the Blues finalized the season-starting roster, which included rookies David Perron, Steven Wagner and Erik Johnson. On October 10, the Blues introduced a new mascot, Louie. Two months later, they traded Doug Weight, a 38-year-old four-time All-Star center, to the Anaheim Ducks as part of a package to acquire 30-year-old center Andy McDonald. On February 8, 2008, it was announced that, after going much of the season without a captain, defenseman Eric Brewer was chosen as the team's 19th captain. The team later traded veteran defenseman Bryce Salvador to the New Jersey Devils for enforcer, and St. Louis native, Cam Janssen. He made his debut two days later, wearing number 55 against the Phoenix Coyotes. After spending the first half of the 2008\u201309 season at or near the bottom of the Western Conference standings, the Blues began to turn things around behind the solid goaltending of Chris Mason. After a strong second-half run, the Blues made the 2009 playoffs on April 10, 2009, after defeating the Columbus Blue Jackets 3\u20131. On April 12, the Blues clinched the sixth seed in the West with a 1\u20130 win against the Colorado Avalanche. For the first time in five years , the Blues were in the playoffs. They faced the third-seeded Vancouver Canucks in the first round, but despite the team's tremendous run to end the season, the Blues would ultimately lose the series in a quick four-game sweep. The Blues fired head coach Andy Murray on January 2, 2010, after a disappointing record , sitting in 12th place in the Conference. Especially galling were the frequent blown leads after two periods, and with the worst home record posted in the entire NHL. After his duties as interim coach for the rest of the 2009\u201310 season, Davis Payne was named the 23rd head coach in the Blues' history on April 14. Payne was previously the head coach of the Blues top minor league affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen of the American Hockey League . Return to contention, first Stanley Cup championship On March 17, 2011, it was announced that the St. Louis Blues were for sale. During the 2011 NHL offseason, the team signed many key free agents, including Brian Elliott, Scott Nichol, Kent Huskins, Jason Arnott and Jamie Langenbrunner. They fired their head coach, Davis Payne, and named Ken Hitchcock as his replacement on November 6, 2011. David Backes was also announced as the new team captain. On March 17, 2012, the Blues became the first team to reach 100 points and clinch a playoff berth in the 2011\u201312 season under Hitchcock, qualifying for their first playoffs since 2008\u201309. They would finish second in the Western Conference, behind the Vancouver Canucks. During the 2012 playoffs, they won their first playoff series since 2002, eliminating the San Jose Sharks in five games. The Blues were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Los Angeles Kings, in the following round. In 2012\u201313, the Blues completed the lockout-shortened season in fourth place in the Western Conference. They were again eliminated by Los Angeles, however, this time in six games in the first round of the playoffs, despite taking an initial 2\u20130 series lead. The following season, 2013\u201314, the team hit the 100-point mark for the sixth time in franchise history, and gained a franchise record of 52 wins. Their chance of winning the Central Division title, the top seed in the West, and the Presidents' Trophy would all evaporate, after they lost their final six games and wound up in second place in the Division, this time to the Colorado Avalanche. The slump haunted them, as they blew a 2\u20130 series lead to the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks, losing the first-round series in six games. This marked the second-straight year the Blues lost in the first round of the playoffs to the reigning champions in six games after leading the series 2\u20130. In 2014\u201315, the Blues won their second Central Division championship in four years and faced the Minnesota Wild in round one of the 2015 playoffs. However, for the third straight year, they lost in the first round and in six games. During the offseason, forward T. J. Oshie was traded to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Troy Brouwer. In 2015\u201316, the Blues finished in second place in the Central Division to the Dallas Stars. The Blues took on the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks in the first-round series. The Blues jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead, but struggled in games 5 and 6. However, St. Louis ended their first-round losing streak by beating Chicago 3\u20132 in game 7 of the series. They moved on to the next round, where they defeated the Dallas Stars in another seven-game series to advance to their first Western Conference Finals since 2001. The Blues season would come to an end at the hands of the San Jose Sharks, who eliminated them in six games. On June 13, 2016, it was announced that Mike Yeo would replace Hitchcock as head coach of the Blues following the 2016\u201317 season. The 2016 offseason saw big changes for the Blues, as team captain David Backes left the team to sign with the Boston Bruins, and goaltender Brian Elliott was traded to the Calgary Flames, while veteran forward Troy Brouwer also signed with Calgary as a free agent. Steve Ott also left the team, signing a free-agent deal with the Red Wings. Jake Allen was now the starting goaltender for the Blues, while the team also signed former Nashville Predators backup Carter Hutton. Former Blues forward David Perron was brought back on a free agent deal, while defenseman Alex Pietrangelo was named team captain. The team started the season by posting a record of 10\u20131\u20132 in their first 13 home games. However, they only won three games on the road during the first two months of the season. Despite defeating the Blackhawks in the 2017 NHL Winter Classic by the score of 4\u20131, the Blues fired Hitchcock and promoted Yeo to head coach on February 1, 2017. Despite an impressive run into the end of the season, when they gained most points in the league from February 1, when Hitchcock was fired, to the end of the season, the Blues were eliminated in the second round by the Nashville Predators in six games. In the offseason for the 2017\u201318 season, the Blues would lose David Perron to the Vegas Golden Knights via an expansion draft. They would also pick up Brayden Schenn from the Philadelphia Flyers by giving away Jori Lehtera. Before the season began, the Blues were hit hard with injuries as they lost Robby Fabbri before the season began. Other players like Patrik Berglund, and Alex Steen did not return in time for the season. Despite these losses, the Blues raced out to a 21\u20138\u20132 start in their first 31 games. The Blues lost more players as Jay Bouwmeester suffered a season-ending injury, and Jaden Schwartz missed a large portion of the season. The Blues also dealt away Paul Stastny to the Winnipeg Jets at the trade deadline for their 1st round pick as they won only 23 games of their remaining 51, but they still had a chance to get into the playoffs on the last day of their season against the Colorado Avalanche. After losing Vladimir Tarasenko to injury during the game, the Blues lost to the Avalanche 5\u20132 as they missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years. During the 2018 NHL offseason, the Blues acquired forward Ryan O'Reilly from the Buffalo Sabres via trade and re-signed Perron to a third stint with the team in free agency, while also signing forwards Tyler Bozak, St. Louis native Pat Maroon, and goaltender Chad Johnson. On November 19, 2018, the Blues fired head coach Mike Yeo after starting the season with a 7\u20139\u20133 record and replaced him with Craig Berube on an interim basis. On March 29, 2019, the Blues became the seventh team in NHL since the 1967\u201368 season to qualify for the playoffs after being placed last after January 1. This resurgence included an eleven-game winning streak between February and March, in large part thanks to the emergence of the eventual Calder Trophy nominee, rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington. On May 21, the Blues advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1970, defeating the San Jose Sharks in a six-game Western Conference Finals series. On May 29, the Blues won a Stanley Cup Finals series game for the first time in franchise history after getting swept in three previous series , when they defeated the Boston Bruins 3\u20132 in overtime. On June 12, 2019, the Blues defeated the Bruins 4\u20131 in Game 7 to win their first Stanley Cup. Ryan O'Reilly won the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP. Up until that point, the Blues were the oldest franchise to never win the Stanley Cup; they were also the last of the five surviving 1967 expansion teams to win the Cup for the first time. This all but assured that Berube would have the \"interim\" tag removed from his title, which occurred two weeks after their Cup victory. Shortly after the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, Karla May of the Missouri Senate introduced a bill which would officially designate several items as state symbols of Missouri; including the Blues being as the state's official hockey team. The bill was signed into law by Mike Parson, the Governor of Missouri, with the revised statute becoming effective August 29, 2019. In the 2019\u201320 season, the Blues suffered an early blow as forward Vladimir Tarasenko suffered a season-ending injury on October 24. However, they would continue their strong play even despite being plagued with various other injuries, consistently remaining at or near the top of the Western Conference. On February 12, 2020, the Blues suffered another loss as defenseman Jay Bouwmeester suddenly collapsed on the bench in a game against the Anaheim Ducks, and would not come back to play again in the season. The game against Anaheim was suspended during the first period and postponed to March 11. This ended up being the Blues' last game in the regular season, as the season would be cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic shortly afterwards. The Blues had remained in strong form throughout the season, finishing first in the Western Conference and second in the NHL. However, as the season was put on pause due to the pandemic, no team would play the full 82 games. Instead, a Return to Play tournament was organized, starting in August 2020. In the Round Robin tournament for the four top-seeded teams of the conference, the Blues failed to get a win, and thus despite winning the regular-season conference title, they ended up being the fourth seed in the West. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the Vancouver Canucks, to whom they lost in six games. In the hiatus preceding the NHL's Return to Play, several Blues players contracted COVID-19, which was cited by the coaching staff as one of the reasons why their play faltered in the playoffs. On September 2, 2020, the Blues traded goaltender Jake Allen, who had spent ten years in the Blues organization, to the Montreal Canadiens."

        "content": "The Blues have worn blue and white jerseys with the famous \"Blue Note\" crest and gold accents since their inception in 1967. From 1967 to 1984, the Blues jerseys featured a lighter shade of blue along with contrasting shoulder yoke and stripes. The blue jerseys lacked the contrasting yoke until 1979. In 1984, the Blues drastically redesigned their look, adding red and darkening the shade of blue. Initially, the front of the jersey featured the team name above the crest logo, but was removed in 1987. In addition, the contrasting shoulder yoke was removed. For the 1994\u201395 season, the Blues introduced a more radical jersey set, featuring red in a more prominent role. The jersey introduced the short-lived trumpet logo on the shoulders and featured thin diagonal stripes on the tail and sleeves. The bottom of the numbers taper off to give way to the aforementioned stripes. An updated version of the blue sweater, produced by Adidas, was brought back in 2019 as their \u201c90s Vintage Jersey.\u201d Before the 1997\u201398 season, the Blues introduced a new alternate white jersey. The jersey brought back the contrasting shoulder yoke and returned to the lighter blue of previous eras. It also replaced red with navy blue as an accent color. A corresponding blue jersey was introduced the following season, thus retiring the previous set. Like all NHL teams, the Blues updated their jerseys for the 2007\u201308 season with new Rbk Edge jerseys. The Blues simplified their design, with only the blue note logo on the front; there were no third jerseys for the season. The Blues announced plans for a navy third jersey featuring a new logo, with the Gateway Arch with the Blue Note superimposed over it inside a circle with the words \"St. Louis\" above and \"Blues\" below. This third jersey was unveiled on September 21, 2008, and debuted during a Blues' home game against the Anaheim Ducks on November 21, 2008. For the 2014\u201315 season, the Blues made a few tweaks to their jerseys. While they kept the Reebok Edge-era template, they brought back the 1998\u20132007 look. The navy blue third jersey was kept without any alterations, before it was retired prior the 2016\u201317 season. When Adidas became the uniform provider before the 2017\u201318 season, the Blues kept most of the same template, with the exception of the home jersey numbers changing from gold to white. For the 2018\u201319 season, the Blues added a third jersey based on the one worn during the 2017 NHL Winter Classic. A corresponding vintage white version was unveiled for the 2022 NHL Winter Classic. Prior to the 2020\u201321 season, the Blues unveiled a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform based on the design worn from 1995 to 1998, but with a red base."

        "content": "Originally, the Blues aired their games on KPLR-TV and KMOX radio, with team patron Gus Kyle calling games alongside St Louis broadcasting legend Jack Buck. Buck elected to leave the booth after one season, though, and was replaced by another famed announcer in Dan Kelly. This setup\u2014Kelly as commentator, with either Kyle, Bob Plager, or Noel Picard joining as an analyst, simulcast on KMOX and KPLR\u2014continued through the 1975\u201376 season, then simulcast on KMOX and KDNL-TV for the next three seasons. KMOX is a 50,000-watt clear-channel station that reaches almost all of North America at night, allowing Kelly to become a celebrity in both the United States and Canada. Indeed, many of the Blues' players liked the fact that their families could hear the games on KMOX. From 1979 to 1981, the radio and television broadcasts were separated for the first time since the inaugural season, with Kelly doing the radio broadcasts and Eli Gold hired to do the television. Following the 1980\u201381 season, the television broadcasts moved from KDNL to NBC affiliate KSD-TV for the 1981\u201382 season, produced by Sports Network Incorporated , owned and operated by Greg Maracek who did the broadcasts with Channel 5 sportscaster Ron Jacober. The broadcasts failed to produce a profit and then returned to KPLR for the 1982 NHL playoffs and the 1982\u201383 season before returning to KDNL for the 1983\u201384 season, the first under the ownership of Harry Ornest. The Blues skated back to KPLR 3 years later. In 1985, Ornest, wanting more broadcast revenue, put the radio rights up for bid. A new company who had purchased KXOK won the bid for a three-year contract and Kelly moved over from KMOX to do the games on KXOK. However, the station was never financially competitive in the market. Additionally, fans complained they could not hear the station at night . KXOK backed out of the contract after just 2 years, and the Blues immediately went back to KMOX, who held the rights until 2000. Dan Kelly continued to broadcast the games on radio but was diagnosed in the summer of 1988 with lung cancer and died on February 10, 1989. After his death, Ron Jacober was hired as the radio play-by-play announcer for the remainder of the season, and John Kelly succeeded in that position. After Dan Kelly's death, Ken Wilson became St. Louis Blues' lead television play-by-play announcer alongside former Blues' players Joe Micheletti and Bruce Affleck. During this time, from 1989 to 2000, more games began to be aired on Prime Sports Midwest, the forerunner to today's Bally Sports Midwest. The long-term partnership between KMOX and the Blues had its problems, however, namely during spring when the ever-popular St. Louis Cardinals began their season. Blues games, many of which were crucial to playoff berths, would often be pre-empted for spring training coverage. Angry at having to play \"second fiddle\", the Blues elected to leave for KTRS in 2000. However, in an ironic twist the Cards purchased a controlling interest in KTRS in 2005, and once again preferred to air preseason baseball over regular-season hockey. In response, the Blues moved back to KMOX starting in the 2006\u201307 season. The season of 2008\u201309 saw the Blues play their last game on KPLR, which had the rights since the 1986\u201387 season , electing to move all their games to FS Midwest, starting with the 2009\u201310 season. The Cardinals moved back to KMOX in the 2011 season, with conflicting games moved to KYKY, an FM station owned by the same group as KMOX. Since the 2019\u201320 preseason, WXOS has been the flagship radio station for the Blues. Chris Kerber and Joe Vitale are the current radio broadcast team. John Kelly and Darren Pang are the current team for television coverage, while Scott Warmann, Erica Weston, Bernie Federko, and Jamie Rivers present the pre-game and post-game shows. Rivers also fills in on color commentary whenever Pang is on a national TV assignment for the NHL on TNT."

        "title": "St. Louis Blues_Traditions",
        "content": "The Blues have a tradition of live organ music. Jeremy Boyer, the Blues organist, plays a Glenn Miller arrangement of W. C. Handy's \"St. Louis Blues\" in its entirety before games and a short version at the end of every period, followed by \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" Boyer also plays the latter song on the organ after Blues goals, with fans replacing the word \"Saints\" with \"Blues.\" On October 1, 2018, it was reported that, for the upcoming season, a new goal song recorded by St. Louis-based band The Urge, \"The Blues Have The Urge,\" would be played after Blues goals, immediately following the traditional organ music. At the end of the national anthem before every home game, the words \"the home of the brave\" are drowned out by fans with \"the home of the Blues.\" Starting in 2014, the team introduced a win song in the form of Pitbull's \"Don't Stop The Party\", but from 2016 to 2018, the win song was \"Song 2\" by Blur after public backlash against using a Pitbull song. Beginning in 2018, the win song has been the aforementioned song recorded by The Urge. However, during the 2019 playoffs, Laura Branigan's \"Gloria\" was played first before The Urge song. The Blues were one of the last teams to add a goal horn, doing so during the 1992\u201393 season at the St. Louis Arena. All of these traditions carried over to the Kiel Center in 1994. After each goal, a bell is rung and each of the goals are counted by the crowd. Since 1990, Ron Baechle, also known as the \"Towel Man\" or \"Towel Guy,\" has celebrated each goal by counting with the bell and throwing a towel into the crowd from section 314. The team also has a long tradition of fan-produced programs, sold outside the arena and providing an often biting, sarcastic, humor-filled alternative to team- and League-produced periodicals. The longest-running fan publication, Game Night Revue, was created by a group of fans in the mold of the Chicago Blackhawks' Blue Line Magazine. It operated for over 10 years, from 1994 to 2005, when its owner decided not to resume the magazine after the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout . After hockey resumed in 2005, a few months after GNRs final issue, a new publication, St. Louis Game Time, was formed by several former GNR staffers. Starting after a couple of players heard \"Gloria\" by Laura Branigan, after their win in Philadelphia on January 3, 2019, the team started to use the song after every home win, and lasted all the way up to their Stanley Cup win. The song has since been retired; the last time they played it was during the raising of the Stanley Cup Championship banner ceremony on October 2, 2019. On February 9th, 2019, another tradition was born. During the 3rd Period, The Blues were winning by a large margin against the visiting Nashville Predators. The Enterprise Center was electric and buzzing with excitement with anticipation of the win. Blues Director of Entertainment, Jason Pippi, commented that they played Country Roads by John Denver, \"was a bit of an mistake... because people love to sing along to that song\". The mistake was that play resumed before the chorus was over and the music had to stop. However, despite the music stopping, the loyal Blues fans in attendance continued to sing loudly. It was loud enough, TV cameras picked up the song loud and clear. Fox Sports Midwest color commentator, Darren Pang, exclaimed he \"just loved the crowd, they're singing!\". Country Roads has been played during every Home game since, at approximately the 15:00 minute mark of the 3rd Period, regardless of the current score. Jason Pippi stated \"its just a testament to the passion Blues fans bring each and every night... to the Cup maybe?\"Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  And it did take them to the Stanley Cup. The St. Louis Blues won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history later that season. After each Home win, the entire St Louis Blues team skates to center ice and in unison, raise their sticks and clap while the goal horn blares, to thank the Blues fans in attendance and watching on TV. It has been called the \"Fan Salute\" by some."

After moving to North America, Hagelin played college hockey for the University of Michigan Wolverines ice hockey team of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association . In doing so, he became the first Swedish ice hockey player to ever play for the University. As a junior in 2009\u201310, Hagelin helped Michigan win the CCHA championship and was named as an Academic All-Big Ten. As a senior in 2010\u201311, Hagelin won the CCHA Best Defensive Forward Award and was named to the All-CCHA First Team. He also won the CCHA Best Defensive Forward Award and was a finalist for the CCHA Player of the Year Award for the 2010\u201311 season, in addition to the Inside College Hockey 2010\u201311 All-America Third Team and the AHCA/Old Time Hockey All-American Ice Hockey Team . Hagelin was then selected in the sixth round, 168th overall, by the New York Rangers at the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. Before playing at Michigan, Hagelin wore the number 26, but when that number was already taken by fellow forward Danny Fardig, Hagelin changed to 12. Hagelin later then chose to wear the number 62 with the Rangers because both 12 and 26 were already taken, so he switched the digits of his old 26, thus wearing 62. Hagelin played in the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships with Sweden, winning silver."

Nevertheless, Hagelin later admitted Rangers teammate Mari\u00e1n G\u00e1bor\u00edk may be an even faster skater. On 15 April 2012, Hagelin received a three-game suspension for elbowing Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson in the head during New York's loss in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals.

Underdogs Wairarapa won the final largely through their Pacific Island combination of Seule Soromon and Pita Rabo. They took the lead in the 24th minute after a period of pressure,  when striker Soromon latched onto a cross from right winger Dale Higham, heading the ball past Hawke's Bay goalkeeper Shaun Peta. Early in the second half, Wairarapa failed to double the lead, when a penalty taken by their captain Adam Cowan hit the woodwork. Napier came back strongly, scoring an equaliser through Fergus Neil in the 67th minute. From this point, however, the game was largely under Wairarapa's control, and a late goal from Rabo secured the win. The Jack Batty Memorial Cup for the final's most valuable player was awarded to Wairarapa's Scott Robinson."

        "content": "Millington was born in Hawarden, Flintshire, and played football for his school side and represented his county. After playing for various local clubs, he joined West Bromwich Albion as a trainee in July 1959. He made his first-team debut for Albion on 30 September 1961, taking over from Ray Potter in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Manchester City. He retained the goalkeeper's jersey for the remainder of the 1961\u201362 season but the following year he and Potter \"shared\" the jersey. His final game for the \"Baggies\" came on 16 March 1963 at Molineux, when he played in the absence of the injured Potter against Wolverhampton Wanderers, conceding seven goals. Millington spent the next 18 months in the reserves before he was transferred to Crystal Palace in October 1964. After two seasons at Selhurst Park, Millington was sold to Peterborough United in March 1966 along with Derek Kevan for a combined fee of \u00a315,000. At Peterborough, he replaced Willie Duff, making his debut on 1 October 1966 in a 5\u20132 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion. He soon became established as the first choice goalkeeper and made 118 league appearances over three years before moving to Wales to join Swansea Town for a \u00a35,000 fee in July 1969. Millington was a \"key figure\" as Swansea gained promotion from the Fourth Division in 1970. In January 1971, Swansea met Rhyl in the Third Round of the FA Cup; in goal for Rhyl was Millington's younger brother, Grenville. The match ended 6\u20131 in favour of Swansea, who then went on to meet Liverpool in the next round, going down 3\u20130. By 1973, Millington was out of favour with Swansea's manager Harry Gregg, who brought in a succession of goalkeepers on loan, the most successful being Jimmy Rimmer from Manchester United."

Despite \"doing well\", Millington conceded three goals with Wales only scoring twice in reply. He retained his shirt for the next two matches, against Hungary and England, both of which ended in defeats. Throughout his international career, Millington was generally the second-choice keeper firstly behind Hollins and then Gary Sprake of Leeds United. On 30 May 1965, he replaced Hollins, who was suffering from food poisoning, in a World Cup qualifying match at Moscow's Central Lenin Stadium against the Soviet Union. Wales went down 2\u20131, with Graham Williams turning the ball past Millington for the hosts' second goal, thus destroying Wales's hopes of qualifying."

Often he would make a save with a \"spectacular\" dive, rather than something simpler. \"Milly\", as he was known, was popular with the fans who saw him as \"a one-man entertainment\". During quiet periods in a match, he would leave his goal and \"cadge sweets from children\" in the crowd or take and eat a pie from supporters. Being superstitious, he was unable to watch penalty kicks being taken at the far end of the pitch and would kneel in the goalmouth with his back to the action. When his team scored a goal, he would often celebrate with a handstand in his penalty area. Legend has it that during his time at Swansea:Warming up before the game, he suddenly chased off the field only to return carrying a chair. He'd spotted an elderly supporter on crutches in the crowd and ushered him into the disabled supporters' enclosure and sat him down to watch the game. An old Swans fan once reported that one of Tony's party-pieces to entertain kids behind the goal was to swing on the crossbar monkey-style. He stopped doing this when this distraction caused him to miss a back pass and conceded an own goal."

His three-year spell with the reserve side saw him play very little with fifteen appearances made over the three years playing for Bordeaux's B team. He left Les Girondins in the summer of 2005 for Portugal. Farnolle signed for Primeira Liga side Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. He impressed manager Lu\u00eds Norton de Matos, who kept him in the first team squad, where he competed to be Set\u00fabal's number one choice goalkeeper alongside Marcelo Moretto and Marco T\u00e1buas. Despite impressing Set\u00fabal's manager, he was beaten to the starting line up by Marcelo Moretto. His relegation to the bench saw him be relegated to Set\u00fabal's B team, who at the time were playing in the Portuguese Second Division. Following the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he left the Sadinos and return to France to play for US Quevilly, where he remained for one season. Over the next few seasons, he moved to several different clubs in the quest to play more first-team football, including a return to Bordeaux, where, like his first spell, he ended up relegated to the B team. In the summer of 2010, he left Bordeaux for Ligue 2 side Clermont Foot, where he established himself as Clermont's first choice goalkeeper. In February 2015, Farnolle signed a contract for three seasons with Romanian club Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti. He played only one game, in the League Cup, then he became a bench-warmer and two months later decided to put an end to the deal. Farnolle signed for Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor in June 2017."

During that time the most passionate \u017deljeznicar fans were located on the south stand of Grbavica Stadium . \u017deljeznicar was a club supported mainly by working class citizens, and their city rivals FK Sarajevo by upper class. In 1981 Zeljeznicar played in Yugoslav Cup finals against FK Velez Mostar. Match was played at Marakana stadium, and attendance was 40 000. The \u017deljeznicar fans were on the east side of stadium. Despite the great support \u017deljo lost the finals. The best moments oh their history \u017deljeznicar had when they played the semi-finals of UEFA Cup in 1984\u201385 season. That year except in Sarajevo \u017deljo had a support in other cities such as Konjic, Travnik, Lukavac and there was a group of \u017deljo fans in Novi Sad. In 1987 the most passionate fans of \u017deljeznicar formed an ultras group called The Maniacs. The Maniacs are located on south stand of Grbavica.  There was also formed subgroups Blue Tigers and Joint Union. For the next years Maniacs become one of the famous supporter groups in country. They followed Zeljo in Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana and other cities across Yugoslavia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia and when Bosnian War start, Grbavica a quarter of the city of Sarajevo where Grbavica Stadium is located was on front lines of battle between Bosnian army and Bosnian Serbs forces. Many members of The Maniacs joined Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Zelene beretke. One of them was D\u017eevad Begi\u0107-\u0110ilda. He was one of the founders and leader of The Maniacs. D\u017eevad Begi\u0107 was killed 1992 by sniper shot when he was trying to save wounded civilians. The most important day of every Maniac is 2 May 1996 when \u017deljezni\u010dar played their first match on Grbavica Stadium after war, the stadium was rebuilt because of heavy structural damage . That day in front of 20 000 Sarajevans FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo played against FK Sarajevo. The game end in a draw 1:1."

        "content": "In gridiron football, the face mask is the part of the helmet that directly covers the face. It is a major source of protection for the players, made of metal covered either with a rubber or plastic coating . Details of the face mask may vary according to each player and their needs for their position. For example, the quarterback's face mask in previous years could be just a single horizontal bar, since he has a need to see the entire field; today, quarterbacks, receivers and kickers/punters wear, at minimum, a two-bar facemask. Positions such as linemen, however, may have several bars on their face mask, both horizontal and vertical. In the leather helmet era, an early attempt at face protection was the \"executioner\" helmet which covered the nose and much of the face. This helmet literally was a face mask bearing a strong likeness to traditional executioner face masks. Another early attempt in the leather helmet era at face protection was the nose guard. These simply covered the player's nose. In modern times, the term \"nose guard\" describes a player on the interior defensive line, usually aligned opposite the offensive center. Face masks first came into vogue in football during the second half of the 1950s, after the hard-shell plastic helmet became commonplace, and were adopted voluntarily and universally at all levels of gridiron football within one decade. Garo Yepremian was the last NFL player to not wear a face mask, only adopting one partway through the 1966 season. Single bars were initially the only available design, and this evolved over the course of the next several decades into the current cage-like designs, which became the norm at all levels by the early 1980s. Single-bar face masks were officially banned in professional football in 2004, with the remaining players still using them allowed to continue wearing them under a grandfather clause; Scott Player was the last player in professional football to wear the single-bar, finishing his career in 2009. Initially, face masks were clear lucite. They then became brown through the use of a rubber coating, which covered the metal bars; the brown later became a neutral gray, and would remain as such until 1974, when the then-San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs introduced the first colored facemasks to football; the two teams rolled out yellow and white facemasks, respectively. This opened the door to many teams at all levels of football changing the facemask color, but some have retained gray ones since. The term \"face mask\" in the game is also used to refer to the foul of illegally touching the equipment. In most leagues, tackling or otherwise restraining a player by grabbing the face mask is illegal due to the risk of injury, and the penalty is severe, drawing 15 yards, and also a first down if committed by the defense. In high school, the penalty is only 5 yards if the act was considered to be \"incidental.\""

There are many types and varieties of grips; the texture, thickness, color, material and surface are all factors that make grips unique."

A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called bevels. The bevels can be numbered from 1 to 8; with the racquet surface perpendicular to the ground, the bevels are numbered from the top anti-clockwise. So bevel 1 would be the narrow bevel at the 'North' position, bevel 2 would be the diagonal bevel at the 'Northwest' position, etc. The badminton handle should be held as if the player was lightly shaking hands with it. For right handed players, the right bottom side of the thumb should be touching the 3rd bevel while the left side of the index finger should be resting on the 7th level. The index finger rests on the 7th bevel above the adjacent location of the thumb on the 3rd level. The finger is shaped like a hook and holds onto the handle near the top section. The other fingers are wrapped around the lower sections of the handle."

Late in the season, in a very important match-up against Princeton, Onyekwe scored the game-sealing bucket with a 360-degree dunk. That play led off SportsCenter's highlights the night it happened. During the Quakers' first-round game of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, he recorded 17 points and six rebounds against Illinois. As a sophomore he repeated as a Second Team-er. Onyekwe averaged 13.8 points and 7.4 rebounds on the season, and in a game against eventual Final Four-bound Maryland, he scored 20 points. The following year, his junior season in 2001\u201302, he was named the Ivy League Player of the Year, was unanimous pick for All-Ivy League First Team, and was also selected for All-Philadelphia Big 5 First Team. He led Penn in scoring, field goal shooting, rebounding and blocks. The Quakers, as the #11-seed in the 2002 NCAA Tournament, lost to #6 California, 82 to 75, in the opening round. Onyekwe's senior season saw him repeat as the Ivy League Player of the Year, becoming just the second player in league history to have earned that honor twice up until that point. He averaged 16.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per game. He repeated as a First Team selection and even earned an honorable mention All-American status from the Associated Press. For most of the season he was projected to be a potential draft pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, which would have made him the first Penn player drafted since Jerome Allen in 1995.

Upon joining the AHL, the Aeros affiliated with the National Hockey League's one-year-old expansion team, the Minnesota Wild. The AHL version of the Aeros won the 2003 Calder Cup and also reached the 2011 Calder Cup finals, but lost to the Binghamton Senators. In 2003, the majority ownership of the franchise was sold to Minnesota Sports and Entertainment, the ownership group of the Wild, while former owner Chuck Watson retained a 10% minority share along with Houston native Nick Sheppard holding a 4% share. The team then moved home games to the new Toyota Center. On April 18, 2013, the Minnesota Wild announced that Minnesota Sports and Entertainment were unable to reach a lease agreement with the Toyota Center, and the Aeros would be relocated to Des Moines, Iowa, beginning with the 2013\u201314 season with home games at Wells Fargo Arena. The Iowa Wild inaugural season was opened on October 12 with a 1\u20130 win over the Oklahoma City Barons. The opening night attendance was 10,200. The team failed to make the playoffs for its first five seasons. On February 22, 2018, the Minnesota Wild extended their contract through 2023.

Having owned the team since, it was no surprise when Kasperi Kapanen made his bantam debut with KalPa's under-16 affiliate in the Jr. C SM-Sarja. Kasperi Kapanen led the team in goals and was second in points, though failed to help them win their playoff qualifier. The following year, as a 15-year-old, Kasperi spent only eight games on the under-16 squad before graduating to the under-18 team playing in the Jr. B SM-Sarja. Kapanen continued his torrid scoring with 24 points in 25 games, finishing second in both goals and points. His third season in Finland's junior system saw more of the same as he swiftly advanced to the under-20 team playing in the Jr. A SM-Liiga and recorded 29 points in 36 games, again leading the team in goals and finishing fourth in points. During the 2012\u201313 season, he also spent 13 games with the senior KalPa team in the SM-Liiga, Finland's top professional league, playing alongside his father. At the end of the year, Kapanen was selected to play for the Finland under-18 national team at the 2013 IIHF World U18 Championships. Kapanen led Finland in goals and was second in points as he helped the team to a bronze medal finish. Entering his draft year as one of the top European prospects, Kapanen spent most of the season with KalPa, scoring 7 goals in 47 games for a team that finished last in the league. He was expected to be an impact player for the Finland under-20 team at the 2014 World Junior Championship but was injured in the last practice before the tournament began and was unable to participate. The lost opportunity did not affect Kapanen's draft stock as he finished atop both the mid-season and final Central Scouting rankings amongst European-based skaters. With KalPa and its under-20 affiliate both eliminated from the respective playoffs, Kapanen was sent to the KalPa under-18 team for the end of their season and aided the Jr. B SM-Sarja team in its third-place league finish. Kapanen tied for the team lead in playoff goals with six despite playing in only four games. Kapanen found himself on Finland's under-18 team for a second consecutive year, but managed just two points in five games as Finland was eliminated in the quarter-final round following a heavy 10\u20130 loss to Sweden. Despite being ranked as the 10th-, 13th- and 18th-best overall prospect by several NHL teams, Kapanen was ultimately selected 22nd overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins, the second-straight year Pittsburgh had selected a Finn in the first round of the NHL Entry Draft, after Olli M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4 in 2012. Jim Rutherford, the Penguins' general manager at the time, had also drafted Kasperi's father when he was general manager of the Hartford Whalers in 1995. On 11 July 2014, Kapanen signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Penguins. On 1 July 2015, Kapanen was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in a blockbuster, multi-player deal involving star forward Phil Kessel. At the 2016 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship, Kapanen scored the game-winning goal in overtime against Russia to win the gold medal."

        "content": "Kapanen began the 2015\u201316 season with the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. As the youngest player in the AHL, Kapanen played well in his role on a deep Marlies team that finished first in league standings. He made his NHL debut on 29 February 2016 against the Tampa Bay Lightning as part of a night where four players would make their debut, including William Nylander. Kapanen would play nine games for the struggling Maple Leafs, recording no points before being returned to the Marlies for the team's 2016 Calder Cup playoff run. Despite finishing as the top seed, the Marlies were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the Hershey Bears. Kapanen returned to the Marlies the following season and quickly became one of their best players. Despite periods of injury, he scored at a pace of a point-a-game before an injury to Maple Leafs forward Nikita Soshnikov resulted in Kapanen being recalled to the Maple Leafs late in the season. Kapanen took a role on the fourth line alongside Brian Boyle and Matt Martin, playing well in limited minutes. He scored his first NHL goal on 8 April 2017 against the Penguins, the team that had drafted him. The goal was a vital one in a game that saw the team clinch a spot in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 2013, a remarkable feat considering the Maple Leafs finished last in the entire league the previous season. A week later, he scored with 8:07 left in double overtime in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals as his Maple Leafs defeated the Washington Capitals 4\u20133 to tie the series at one game apiece. The Leafs ended up losing the series in six games. Kapanen was sent down to the Marlies to begin the 2017\u201318 season, but was recalled on 28 October 2017 after playing six games for the Marlies. He was sent back down to the Marlies on 7 November, only to be recalled again on 12 December. He had been selected for the 2018 AHL All-Star Game, but was replaced by Andreas Johnsson. Kapanen recorded his first and only goal of the 2018 playoffs in Game 7 against the Boston Bruins, becoming the youngest player in NHL history to score a shorthanded goal in a Game 7. The Maple Leafs lost the series 3\u20134. Following the Maple Leafs' defeat, Kapanen joined the Finland senior national team at the 2018 IIHF World Championship. After attending the Maple Leafs' training camp, Kapanen began the 2018\u201319 season NHL. As teammate William Nylander remained unsigned and in contract negotiations with Toronto, Kapanen replaced his spot on the team's top line. Kapanen finished the season with 20 goals and 44 points in 78 games. On 28 June 2019, Kapanen signed a new three-year, $9.6\u00a0million contract with Toronto worth an annual average value of $3.2\u00a0million."

On 21 January 1909, he scored a memorable goal against Football League side Wolves in an FA Cup first round replay. In the dying minutes of extra time, Fred Fountain wrote of the goal in the Croydon Advertiser in 1946: \"...he simply weaved his way through all the players and dribbled it right up to the Wolves' goal, putting in an unstoppable shot.\" Writing in The Penny Illustrated Paper, John Cameron called Needham \"The brilliant Crystal Palace 'utility man'.\""

Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players and was to blame for the relegation.  Indeed, between 1992 and January 1995, Norwich had disposed of a number of key attacking players: Robert Fleck , Ruel Fox , Chris Sutton ,  Efan Ekoku and Mark Robins . Nearly 40\u00a0years after being instrumental in saving the club from bankruptcy, Geoffrey Watling bought Chase's majority shareholding. Gary Megson was appointed Norwich manager on a temporary basis for the second time in eight months. Megson remained in charge until the end of the season before leaving the club.
