The focus transitions to police captain Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Karas, as he defuses a hostage situation by killing the hostage-takers. Afterwards Karas is given the job of solving the mystery surrounding Ilona's disappearance. Karas begins by contacting Dr. Jonas Muller, a former Avalon scientist familiar with her. Muller had been working to cure progeria, a genetic condition which affected his brother. Muller worked for Avalon as their top scientist but left after he failed to find a cure and his brother died. He took up new work at a free clinic. Muller tells Karas that \"No one ever leaves Avalon\", throwing the corporation under suspicion. Karas visits Paul Dellenbach, one of Avalon's CEOs and questions him about Ilona. On suggesting he may have been sleeping with her, Dellenbach replies \"I sleep with my wife, I sleep with my secretary, I even sleep with my sister-in-law but I would never sleep with one of my researchers\". After following a series of dead ends, control tells Karas they are tailing Illona's car through Paris. Eventually he captures the driver after a chase which ends at the Eiffel Tower. The man turns out to be a henchmen of Farfella, an Arab Muslim mobster and a childhood friend of Karas. The police captain returns the criminal to Farfella who in return gives him security footage of Illona's kidnapping; it shows her car being stolen by an incredibly old man. Karas asks Ilona's sister, Bislane, who works for Avalon to break into the company's Archives to discover what Muller was researching. Bislane discovers that a Dr. Nakata worked with Muller in a quest to find a cure for progeria. But they destroyed all evidence of their work when some of the children they were testing on started to mutate. Karas and Bislane then escape because accessing the closed file has alerted Avalon security. Later Karas opens up to Bislane and tells her that he and Farfella were raised in the casbah where they worked with gangs. After a drug run went wrong, they ended up in a holding cell. Farfella escaped but Karas was left to the mercy of the other gang. Karas puts Bislane under false arrest to protect her from Avalon. Meanwhile, Ilona is shown confined in a cyber ball which is being controlled by the old man. Eventually Karas tracks down Muller. He explains that he took Ilona because through her research she has discovered the secret to eternal life ; but knowing what the consequences would be if Avalon acquired such knowledge, he kidnapped her. Karas tries to encourage the old scientist to hand himself in but Muller is mistakenly shot by a police marksman. Karas then deduces that the mysterious old man is Muller's younger brother: now immortal but trapped in an elderly body. Karas calls on Farfella who hides Bislane from Avalon while also getting a fake passport for Ilona. However the mega-corporation's security are also closing in on the Parisian sewer where Ilona is being held captive. After a short battle, Karas is mortally wounded rescuing Ilona. However she refuses to take the fake passport to start a new life. Instead she tells Karas she wants immortality by giving her discovery to Avalon. Reluctantly Karas shoots her in the back as she walks back towards Avalon security. CEO Dellenbach watches all this happen through a live feed from one of his men's helmet camera. As Karas lies dying, he imagines himself apologising to Bislane for killing her sister, for which she forgives him. The film closes with Muller's little brother living as a tramp, throwing his picture of him and his brother into a burning bin.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

After the successes of the romantic Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and the historical epic Devdas \u2014one of the most expensive Hindi films ever made at the time\u2014he had made a plan to make another film in the romantic genre. Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\". Furthermore, he added, \"Black is about the love between a girl and her teacher. They teach each other the dignity of living. To call Black a love story is a true compliment.

{"id": "91_8", "question": "What genre is David Allan?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_3630", "text": "Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States, and of American literature. Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story, and considered to be the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction. Poe was the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan. Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, but she died of tuberculosis in 1847. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn , but before it could be produced, he died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown, and has been variously attributed to many causes including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide. Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today.

His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Many of his works are generally considered part of the dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism which Poe strongly disliked. He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as \"Frog-Pondians\", after the pond on Boston Common, and ridiculed their writings as \"metaphor\u2014run mad,\" lapsing into \"obscurity for obscurity's sake\" or \"mysticism for mysticism's sake\". Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike transcendentalists, \"only the pretenders and sophists among them\". Beyond horror, Poe also wrote satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity. \"Metzengerstein\" is the first story that Poe is known to have published and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genre. Poe also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in \"The Balloon-Hoax\". Poe wrote much of his work using themes aimed specifically at mass-market tastes. To that end, his fiction often included elements of popular pseudosciences, such as phrenology and physiognomy.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_11", "question": "What genre is Nine Inch Nails?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_17502", "text": "Formation In 1987 in Cleveland, Ohio, Trent Reznor played keyboards in the Exotic Birds, a synthpop band managed by John Malm Jr. Reznor became friends with Malm, who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios. Studio owner Bart Koster granted Reznor free access to the studio between bookings to record demos, commenting that it cost him nothing more than \"a little wear on [his] tape heads\". Unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired, but inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments except drums himself. He has continued to play most parts on Nine Inch Nails recordings ever since. The first Nine Inch Nails performance took place at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio, on October 21, 1988, as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor aimed to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine demos, recorded live in November 1988 and collectively known as Purest Feeling, were released in revised form on the first studio album, Pretty Hate Machine . The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar, as well as a heavier use of film samples. Reznor chose the name \"Nine Inch Nails\" because it \"abbreviated easily\" rather than for \"any literal meaning\". Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to reference Jesus' crucifixion with nine-inch spikes, or Freddy Krueger's nine-inch fingernails. The English letters \"NIN\" are also noted for their resemblance to the modern Hebrew characters of the Tetragrammaton.  The Nine Inch Nails logo first appeared on the music video for their debut single, \"Down in It\". Reznor and Gary Talpas designed the logo, inspired by Tibor Kalman's typography on the Talking Heads album Remain in Light. Talpas, a native of Cleveland, continued to design Nine Inch Nails packaging until 1997. Pretty Hate Machine Written, arranged, and performed by Reznor, Nine Inch Nails' first album Pretty Hate Machine debuted in 1989. It marked his first collaboration with Adrian Sherwood and Mark \"Flood\" Ellis. Reznor asked Sean Beavan to mix the demos of Pretty Hate Machine, which had received multiple offers for record deals. He mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails' live concerts for several years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band and singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has made remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the Right Track Studio demos by adding singles \"Head Like a Hole\" and \"Sin\". Rolling Stone's Michael Azerrad described the album as \"industrial-strength noise over a pop framework\" and \"harrowing but catchy music\"; Reznor proclaimed this combination \"a sincere statement\" of \"what was in [his] head at the time\". In fact, the song \"Down in It\" spent over two months on Billboard club-play dance chart. After spending 113 weeks on the Billboard 200, Pretty Hate Machine became one of the first independently released records to attain platinum certification. Three music videos were created in promotion of the album. MTV aired the videos for \"Down in It\" and \"Head Like a Hole\", but an explicit video for \"Sin\" was only released in partial form for Closure. The original version of the \"Down in It\" video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the FBI. In 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band members were asked what shows they would like to appear on. They jokingly replied that they would like to appear on Dance Party USA, since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance. In 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, in which it toured North America as an opening act for alternative rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991. Broken After a poor European reception opening for Guns N' Roses, the band returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine. After finding out they were hindering control of his project, Reznor criticized the labeling of Nine Inch Nails as a commercially oriented band and demanded his label terminate his contract, but they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. Involved in a feud with TVT, he signed a record deal with Interscope Records and created Nothing Records: We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on. In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles , the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's \"family\" murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. The band used it to record Broken, an extended play that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized Broken as a guitar-based \"blast of destruction\", and as \"a lot harder\u00a0... than Pretty Hate Machine\". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from Broken earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single \"Happiness in Slavery\" from Woodstock '94, and the second single \"Wish\". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for \"Wish\", Reznor joked that \"Wish\" became \"the only song to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics.\" Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label. Peter Christopherson of the bands Coil and Throbbing Gristle directed a performance video for \"Wish\", but the EP's most controversial video accompanied \"Happiness in Slavery\". The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of performance artist Bob Flanagan disrobed and lying on a machine that pleasures, tortures, then kills him. A third video for \"Pinion\", partially incorporated into MTV's Alternative Nation opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of a person in bondage. Reznor and Christopherson compiled the three clips along with footage for \"Help Me I Am in Hell\" and \"Gave Up\" into a longform music video titled Broken.  It depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles. A separate performance video for \"Gave Up\" featuring Richard Patrick and Marilyn Manson was filmed at Le Pig. A live recording of \"Wish\" was also filmed, and both videos appeared in Closure. Broken was followed by the companion remix EP Fixed in late 1992. The only track that was left off the final version of the release is the remix of \"Last\", produced by Butch Vig . The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11\u00a0kHz file, \"NIN_LAST.AIFF\", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks at remix.nin.com). Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying \"I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage.\" The Downward Spiral Early ideas for The Downward Spiral arose after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival's concerts ended in September. Reznor elaborated the album's themes into lyrics. Despite initially choosing to record the album in New Orleans, Reznor searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, in Los Angeles renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, the start of the making of both Broken and The Downward Spiral. Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, The Downward Spiral, entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and is the band's highest seller in the US, over four million copies, among five million worldwide. Influenced by Pink Floyd and by David Bowie of the 1970s, The Downward Spiral's diverse textures and moods depict a protagonist's mental progress. Flood co-produced several tracks, while Alan Moulder mixed most, and later found more extensive production duties on future albums. Reznor invited Sean Beavan to work on The Downward Spiral. After contributing to remixes of Nine Inch Nails songs, such as \"Closer\", Beavan mixed and co-produced Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar in 1996. The Downward Spiral, alike Broken, was recorded at Le Pig Studios. \"March of the Pigs\" and \"Closer\" were singles. Two other tracks, \"Hurt\" and \"Piggy\", though not singles, were issued to radio. Also in 1994, the band released the promotional single \"Burn\", which Reznor produced, on the soundtrack of Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. as well as a cover of the Joy Division song \"Dead Souls\" on the soundtrack to the film The Crow, which went to number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The music video for \"Closer\", directed by Mark Romanek, was in MTV's frequent rotation, although the network, deeming it too graphic, heavily censored the original. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag.  A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime. Contemporary critics generally praised The Downward Spiral, now classed among the most important albums of the 1990s. In 2005, Spin ranked it 25th among the \"100 Greatest Albums, 1985\u20132005\". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it 200 among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Blender named it the 80th Greatest American Album. It was ranked No.\u00a0488 in the book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time by Martin Popoff. In 2001 Q named The Downward Spiral as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time; in 2010 the album was ranked No.\u00a0102 on their 250 Best Albums of Q's Lifetime list. After The Downward Spiral's release, Reznor produced an accompanying remix album entitled Further Down the Spiral, the only non-major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified gold in the United States and among the best-selling remix albums of all time. It contained contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, among others. After The Downward Spiral's 1994 release, the live band supported it by embarking on the Self Destruct Tour. The stage set-up featured dirty curtains, rising and lowering for visuals shown during songs such as \"Hurt\". The tour debuted the band's grungy, messy image as the members appeared in ragged attire slathered in corn starch. Performances were violent and chaotic, band members often injuring themselves by attacking each other, diving into the crowd, and destroying their instruments to close. The widest mainstream audience was a mud-soaked performance at Woodstock '94, and seen by Pay-Per-View in up to 24\u00a0million homes. Enjoying mainstream success thereafter, Nine Inch Nails then performed amid greater production values, adding theatrical visual elements. Supporting acts on tour included The Jim Rose Circus and Marilyn Manson. Released in 1997, the Closure video documented highlights from the tour, including full live videos of \"Eraser\", \"Hurt\" and a one-take \"March of the Pigs\" clip directed by Peter Christoperson. In 1997 Reznor also produced the soundtrack to the David Lynch film Lost Highway, which featured one new Nine Inch Nails song, \"The Perfect Drug\". Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of The Fragile. The Fragile Five years elapsed between The Downward Spiral and Nine Inch Nails' next studio album, The Fragile, which arrived as a double album in September 1999. The Fragile was conceived by making \"songwriting and arranging and production and sound design\u00a0... the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song.\" Canadian rock producer Bob Ezrin was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he \"provided final continuity and flow.\" On the heels of the band's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded The Fragile more than a year before its release, when it was already described as \"oft-delayed\". The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week and receiving generally positive reviews. Spin hailed The Fragile as the \"album of the year\", whereas Pitchfork Media panned its \"melodramatic\" lyrics. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: \"The Day the World Went Away\" in North America; \"We're in This Together\" in the EU and Japan ; and \"Into the Void\" in Australia. Several songs from the album became regulars on alternative rock radio stations, however the album dropped to number 16 and slipped out of the Billboard Top 10 only a week after its release, resulting in the band setting a record for the biggest drop from number one, which has since been broken. Reznor funded the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket. Before the album's release, the song \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize. Cinesexuality critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a \"scathing attack on the alternative music scene,\" particularly Reznor's former friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Marilyn Manson. The two artists put aside their differences when Manson appeared in the song's music video, retitled \"Starsuckers, Inc.\" and performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at Madison Square Garden in 2000. Reznor followed The Fragile with another remix album, Things Falling Apart, released in November 2000 to poor reviews, a few months after the 2000 Fragility tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as And All That Could Have Been. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc Still, containing stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music. During the Fragility 2.0 tour, Reznor suffered a heroin overdose in London in June 2000, forcing a gig which was to be played that night to be cancelled. The incident pushed Reznor into entering rehab, putting Nine Inch Nails on hold while he attempted to become sober. In 2002, Johnny Cash covered the Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" for his album, American IV: The Man Comes Around, to critical acclaim. After seeing the music video, which later won a Grammy, Reznor himself became a fan of the rendition: I pop the video in, and wow\u00a0... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps\u00a0... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore\u00a0... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning\u2014different, but every bit as pure. With Teeth A further six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth full-length album. With Teeth was released in May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. With Teeth debuted on top of the Billboard 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number one with an album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band's official MySpace page in advance of its release date. Critical reception of the album was mostly positive: Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield described the album as \"vintage Nine Inch Nails\". PopMatters condemned the album, claiming Reznor \"ran out of ideas.\" A music video for the song \"The Hand That Feeds\" premiered on the Nine Inch Nails official website in March 2005. Reznor released the source files for it in GarageBand format a month later, allowing fans to remix the song. He similarly released files for the album's second single \"Only\" in a wider range of formats, including Pro Tools and ACID Pro. David Fincher directed a video for \"Only\" with primarily computer-generated imagery. The planned music video for its third single, \"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\", was directed by Francis Lawrence but reportedly scrapped in the post-production stage. All three singles topped the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Nine Inch Nails launched a North American arena tour in Autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Autolux and Death from Above 1979. Another opening act on the tour, hip-hop artist Saul Williams, performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. The Nine Inch Nails live band completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The Beside You in Time tour documentary was released in February 2007 via three formats: DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The home video release debuted at number one on both the Billboard Top Music Videos and Billboard Comprehensive Music Videos charts in the United States. Year Zero Nine Inch Nails' fifth studio album, Year Zero, was released on April 17, 2007, only two years after With Teeth, a marked change in the slow pace from the release of previous albums. With lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Year Zero is a concept album criticizing the United States government's policies and their impact on the world 15 years in the future. Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on Metacritic. The story takes place in the United States in 2022, which has been termed \"Year 0\", by the government, being the year America was reborn. It had suffered several major terrorist attacks, apparently by Islamic fundamentalists, including attacks on Los Angeles and Seattle, and in response, the government seized absolute control of the country. The government is a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano. The government corporation Cedocore distributes the drug Parepin through the water supply, making Americans who drink water apathetic and carefree. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably Art is Resistance and Solutions Backwards Initiative.  In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authorities.  The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place. An alternate reality game emerged parallel to the Year Zero concept, expanding upon its storyline. Clues hidden on tour merchandise initially led fans to discover a network of fictitious, in-game websites that describe an \"Orwellian picture of the United States circa the year 2022\". Before Year Zero's release, unreleased songs from the album were found on USB drives hidden at Nine Inch Nails concert venues in Lisbon and Barcelona, as part of the alternate reality game. Fan participation in the alternate reality game caught the attention of media outlets such as USA Today and Billboard, who have cited fan-site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries. The album's first single, \"Survivalism\", and other tracks from Year Zero were released as multitrack audio files for fans to remix. A remix album titled Year Zero Remixed was later released, containing remixes from Year Zero by other artists.  The remix album was Nine Inch Nails' final release on a major record label for over five years, as the act had completed its contractual obligation to Interscope Records and did not renew its contract. The remix album was accompanied by an interactive remix site with multitrack downloads and the ability to post remixes. Reznor planned a film adaption of the album and noted Year Zero as \"part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist.\" The project moved into the television medium because of high costs for Year Zero as a film, then Reznor found American film producer Lawrence Bender and met with writers. On August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal: \"We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens.\" Since first announcing his plans for a television series, progress slowed, reportedly due to the 2007\u20132008 Writer's Guild strike, but it nevertheless continued.  the resultant miniseries, also named Year Zero, was in development with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions, with the screenplay and script written by Reznor and Carniv\u00e0le writer Daniel Knauf. Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip In February 2008, Reznor posted a news update on the Nine Inch Nails website entitled \"2 weeks\". On March 2, Ghosts I\u2013IV , a 36-track instrumental album, became available via the band's official website. Ghosts I\u2013IV was made available in a number of different formats and forms, ranging from a free download of the first volume, to a $300 Ultra-Deluxe limited edition package. All 2,500 copies of the $300 package sold out in three days.  The album is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike licence.  The album was created improvisationally over a 10-week period and contributors included Atticus Ross, Alan Moulder, Alessandro Cortini, Adrian Belew, and Brian Viglione. Similar to the announcement that ultimately led to the release of Ghosts I\u2013IV, a post on the band's website in April 2008 read \"2 weeks!\" On May 5, Nine Inch Nails released The Slip via its website without any advertisement or promotion. The album was made available for download free of charge with a message from Reznor, \"this one's on me,\" protected under the same Creative Commons licence as Ghosts, and has seen individual downloads surpassing 1.4\u00a0million.  The Slip has since been released on CD as a limited edition set of 250,000. Since the release of Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip, a 25-date tour titled Lights in the Sky, was announced in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, but it became a quartet with the addition of Ilan Rubin on drums. On January 7, 2009, Reznor uploaded unedited HD-quality footage from three shows as a download of over 400 GB via BitTorrent. In an immediate response, a fan organization known as This One Is On Us quickly downloaded the data and had begun to assemble the footage alongside its own video recordings to create a professional 3-part digital film, followed by a physical release created \"by fans for fans\". This tour documentary became collectively known as Another Version of the Truth and was released throughout late December 2009 to February 2010 via three formats: DVD, Blu-ray Disc and BitTorrent. To date, the group and the project has received significant attention from media outlets such as USA Today, Rolling Stone, Techdirt and Pitchfork TV, and holds the support of both Reznor and the fan community with theatrical screenings being held all over the world. Nine Inch Nails art director and webmaster Rob Sheridan noted on the band's official website: This is yet another example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of openness combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever. Nine Inch Nails Revenge, an iPhone/iPod touch-exclusive rhythm game developed by Tapulous, was released on March 8, 2009 . This installment in the Tap Tap video game franchise was themed after Nine Inch Nails, and included tracks from Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip. Portions of the album Ghosts I-IV were also used in making of the soundtrack for the documentary Citizenfour. In February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on his official website, stating that \"I've been thinking for some time now it's time to make NIN disappear for a while.\" Reznor since clarified that he \"isn't done creating music under the moniker, but that Nine Inch Nails is done touring for the foreseeable future.\" The \"Wave Goodbye\" tour concluded on September 10, 2009, at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Reznor subsequently released two tracks under the Nine Inch Nails moniker: the theme song for the film Tetsuo: The Bullet Man, and a cover of U2's \"Zoo Station\", included in the Achtung Baby tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. In 2009 Reznor married Mariqueen Maandig, and formed a project with Maandig and Atticus Ross dubbed How to Destroy Angels. Its first release, a six-track self-titled EP, was made available for free download in June 2010. Reznor's next collaboration with Ross was co-writing and producing the official score for David Fincher's 2010 film, The Social Network. Reznor and Ross received two awards for the score, a 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture, and a 2010 Oscar for Best Original Score. Reznor and Ross again collaborated with Fincher for the official score the American adaptation of the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, released in December 2011, and then again on Fincher's 2014 film Gone Girl In July 2012 Reznor teamed up with video game developer Treyarch to compose the theme music for Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Later that year Reznor again worked with Atticus Ross along with Alessandro Cortini on a remix of the song \"Destroyer\" by Telepathe. Reznor also appeared in a documentary called \"Sound City\" directed by Dave Grohl, in addition to co-writing and performing the song \"Mantra\" with Grohl and Josh Homme. This led to further collaboration with Reznor and Homme on the 2013 album from Queens of the Stone Age titled ...Like Clockwork. Reznor contributed vocals and drum programing to the song \"Kalopsia\" and vocals on \"Fairweather Friends\" along with Elton John on piano and vocals. In October a project with Dr. Dre and Beats Electronics was announced that Reznor wrote was \"probably not what you're expecting [from me]\". The project was named \"Daisy\"; a digital music service was announced in January 2013. It was until January 2014 that the service was fully launched, with Reznor serving as chief creative officer. Hesitation Marks In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Reznor indicated that he would be writing for the majority of 2012 with Nine Inch Nails \"in mind\". Reznor eventually confirmed that he was working on new Nine Inch Nails material and might be performing live again. In February 2013, Reznor announced the return of Nine Inch Nails and revealed the Twenty Thirteen Tour. He also revealed that the new lineup of the band would include Eric Avery of Jane's Addiction, Adrian Belew of King Crimson, and Josh Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv, as well as returning members Alessandro Cortini and Ilan Rubin. However, both Avery and Belew would quit the touring band before performances commenced, with former member Robin Finck returning in their place. By May 28 a new Nine Inch Nails album was complete. Released September 3, Hesitation Marks incorporated rhythms reminiscent of earlier releases, but was more expansive and theatrical. In addition to the recently departed Adrian Belew, Reznor employed bassist Pino Palladino along with  Todd Rundgren and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham to achieve various art-rock elements. The album produced three singles, all released prior to that of the album itself. \"Came Back Haunted\" was released on June 6, with an accompanying music video bearing an epileptic seizure warning. The second single, \"Copy of A\", was released on August 12 free of charge to US and UK Amazon.com account holders. \"Everything\" was the third and final single, recorded during sessions for the Nine Inch Nails greatest hits album. The sessions gave way to more songs that ended up yielding the entire album. In July the Twenty Thirteen Tour was underway, beginning with a slew of festival appearances that included the Fuji Rock Festival, and the Pukkelpop, Hockenheim, Germany's Rock'n'Heim and the Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The Tension 2013 North American leg of the tour ran from September to November and added Palladino, Lisa Fischer and Sharlotte Gibson to the lineup with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Explosions in the Sky as opening acts. This leg of the tour was documented and released in the spring as Nine Inch Nails Tension 2013. In 2014 the band extended its tour worldwide as a four-piece. The new lineup included previous collaborators, Ilan Rubin, Alessandro Cortini, and Robin Finck. The band was joined by Queens of the Stone Age for the Australia and New Zealand tour, during which a nightly coin toss determined who opened. The tour closed in Europe with supporting synth-pop act Cold Cave. After a month-long break, Nine Inch Nails again hit the road on a joint tour with Soundgarden. The 23-day journey extended throughout the continental US, with experimental hip-hop group Death Grips scheduled to open most of the shows. Two weeks into the tour, Death Grips announced its breakup and cancelled all subsequent live shows. Oneohtrix Point Never, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Cold Cave each replaced Death Grips separately for the remainder of the tour. In 2014, its first year of eligibility, Nine Inch Nails was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with 14 other candidates. While they were not inducted that year, the band placed second in the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees Fan Vote. In 2015, Nine Inch Nails was once again nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, they once again did not get inducted. In June 2015, Nine Inch Nails released instrumental versions of The Fragile and With Teeth to stream exclusively on Apple Music, a service of which Reznor is chief creative director. In an interview promoting the service, Reznor mentioned he has started \"messing around with some things\" in regards to a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating \"It's not a record I'm trying to finish in a month. It's more just feeling around in the dark and seeing what sounds interesting\". In December 2015, Reznor reported that \"Nine Inch Nails will return in 2016\". The Trilogy In October 2016, in response to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with \"2016 is not over yet\". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return by the end of the year: \"Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? ... Just wait and see what happens.\" Three days later, Reznor announced an EP titled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip to be released later in 2017, these plans however fell through. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band. In early 2017, the band announced three headlining festival dates in North America. In January 2017, the band announced that it would be performing at the Panorama Music Festival in New York on July 30. On March 21, the band announced on their official Facebook page that it would be headlining Day 3 of FYF Fest in Los Angeles on July 23. In the same post, the band also announced their 2017 touring lineup, which included Reznor and Ross joined by the band's 2014 touring lineup, Robin Finck, Alessandro Cortini, and Ilan Rubin. The band appeared in Part 8 of the third season of Twin Peaks, performing their song, \"She's Gone Away\". In June 2017, in an email that was issued out to customers waiting on delayed vinyl orders, Reznor confirmed that Not the Actual Events would actually make up the first part of a trilogy of EPs, with the second installment Add Violence being released on July 21 and the third and final EP of the trilogy to follow in 2018. The single \"Less Than\" was released a week prior to the second EP's release. Also in 2017, the pair were tasked to score the upcoming Ken Burns series The Vietnam War, and provide both original music and a compilation soundtrack of popular songs. Their score, which was released on September 15, 2017, included original compositions, and it also includes reworked pieces from other Nine Inch Nails songs and their award-winning scores for\u00a0The Social Network\u00a0and\u00a0The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The band released their ninth studio album, Bad Witch,<ref name=\"PF2\">{{cite tweet |author=Pitchfork |user=pitchfork |number=994589241354092544 |date=May 10, 2018 |title=Update: A representative for NIN has confirmed that Bad Witch is an album, not an EP http://p4k.in/zDVHilU  |link=https://twitter.com/pitchfork/status/994589241354092544 |access-date=May 10, 2018}}</ref> on June 22, 2018. The band also announced the \"Cold and Black and Infinite 2018 North America Tour\", where it toured with The Jesus and Mary Chain. To prevent ticket scalping, the band took the unusual step of only selling physical tickets that had to be purchased at the venue prior to the shows. Reznor stated of the decision \"The promise of a world made better by computers and online connectivity has failed us in many ways, particularly when it comes to ticketing. Everything about the process sucks and everyone loses except the reseller. We've decided to try something different that will also likely suck, but in a different way.\" Nine Inch Nails was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. In October 2019, Nine Inch Nails was again nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Ghosts V\u2013VI On January 15, 2020, Nine Inch Nails were officially named as members of the Class of 2020 for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the induction ceremony was postponed indefinitely.   Originally, only Trent Reznor was to be inducted as the sole full-time member of the group for most of its history.  After holding discussions with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Reznor announced that former live band members Chris Vrenna and Danny Lohner, as well as current members Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin , longtime guitarist Robin Finck, and the only other full time member of the band, Atticus Ross, would all be inducted as members of Nine Inch Nails. On March 26, 2020, Nine Inch Nails released Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts, their tenth and eleventh studio albums and the sequels to their 2008 instrumental album Ghosts I\u2013IV. The albums were released for free as a show of solidarity with the band's fans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the live induction ceremony for the 2020 Hall of Fame Induction was cancelled on July 15, 2020, and simultaneously, an induction special was announced to be broadcast and available for streaming through HBO and HBO Max, respectively, on November 7, 2020.  In the interim, a special display was created to represent Nine Inch Nails' presence in the Hall of Fame that celebrated their popular, muddy performance at Woodstock '94; opened on the 26th anniversary of the concert.  On November 6, 2020, Trent Reznor and the other to-be-inducted members of Nine Inch Nails were interviewed by journalist David Farrier about the history of the band and their feelings on being inducted.  Then on November 7, Nine Inch Nails was formally inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, by punk icon Iggy Pop.  Reznor thanked the fans, his family, and all of his many Nine Inch Nails collaborators in his acceptance speech, recorded from his home in Beverly Hills, CA. On May 6, 2021, Nine Inch Nails released a new track, \"Isn't Everyone\" in collaboration with noise rock group HEALTH, who had previously been an opening act on their Lights In The Sky and Wave Goodbye tours. On May 7, they announced they would be playing two shows in Cleveland with the Pixies to commemorate their inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which, according to the band, would be \"the only NIN headline shows in 2021\". Those shows were cancelled on August 19, 2021, due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. Also in 2021, Reznor and Ross produced Halsey's album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power. It was later nominated for the Best Alternative Music Album award at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. In February 2022, Nine Inch Nails announced a short tour of the United States for 2022, the group's first performances in nearly four years.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He adds, \"At the three-quarter point of Passage, Willis does something that no reviewer should leak but it is much of what makes the book worth reading. What she attempts is to find a way to look at death and life after death in a way that doesn't conflict with matters of faith, but which also is consistent with the fundamentally rational underpinnings of science fiction.\" SciFi.com describes Passage as \"an emotionally exhausting trip\" that is ultimately \"a rewarding experience.\" Laura Miller, writing for Salon, says that \"its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and \u2014 what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling \u2014 its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin , which explains in part why Passage seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\" The SF Site review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke is over-extended here...\"; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that \"Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending.

Leonard found Out of This World a welcome antidote to The Avengers, which had proved a difficult production; he recalled, \"It was a great pleasure to make, getting away from today and exploring the unrealities of tomorrow. An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000. Shubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis. The actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence. Three scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K. Dick's \"Impostor\" and Clifford D. Simak's \"Immigrant\" as well as an original story called \"Botany Bay\", were supplied by Terry Nation, who would, a short time after, create the Daleks for Doctor Who. Nation's scripts were his first professional foray into science fiction, the genre for which he would become best known. Apart from a number of scripts for Doctor Who, Nation would go on to create the original science fiction series Survivors and Blake's 7.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its story begins when Dark Matter invades Ripple Star, a planet populated by fairies. The fairy Ribbon flees with a sacred crystal, but Dark Matter shatters it and spreads it across the galaxy. Ribbon lands on Pop Star and meets Kirby, who agrees to help retrieve the shards and defeat Dark Matter. Along the way, they enlist the help of artist Adeleine, King Dedede, and Dedede's minion Waddle Dee, after each of them stumble upon a crystal shard and end up being possessed by Dark Matter, forcing Kirby to battle each of them in order to free them from the Dark Matter's influence. Similar to contemporary platformers such as Pandemonium! and Klonoa: Door to Phantomile , Kirby 64 is a 2.5D platformer; although environments and characters are rendered in 3D computer graphics, gameplay is restricted to a 2D plane. Players control Kirby using the Nintendo 64 controller's D-pad. Like earlier Kirby games, Kirby can walk or run, crouch, jump, and inhale enemies or objects to spit them out as bullets. He can fly for a limited time by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, though he can release a weak puff of air. By eating certain enemies, Kirby can gain copy abilities, power-ups allowing him to take on the properties the enemy possessed. King Dedede is also playable at certain points, and can use his hammer to break objects Kirby cannot. Kirby 64 introduces Power Combos, the option to combine Kirby's copy abilities. Power Combos can be created by inhaling two enemies at once, by throwing one ability at another, or by spitting an enemy at another. The latter two methods create a colored star that can be collected to obtain the Power Combo. There are 28 possible combinations, which are stronger than normal copy abilities or have added effects. For instance, by combining the \"Fire\" and \"Needle\" abilities, Kirby can shoot fire arrows. Players can also mix two of the same abilities, which will increase their power. The game takes place across six worlds, which are split into several levels. After the player selects a level, they must navigate it while avoiding enemies and obstacles. If Kirby or King Dedede touches an enemy or hazard, he loses health. Health can be replenished by eating food scattered across levels. If all health is lost or the character falls off the bottom of the screen or gets crushed by a moving object, the player loses a life. Losing all lives results in a game over. Players can earn lives by collecting stars or 1-ups. Shards of the crystal are scattered about levels, and while Power Combos are optional, they are required to collect the shards and reach the game's ending. At the end of each level, players play a bonus game to collect food, stars, or cards with information about enemies. Certain levels feature bosses that the player must defeat to proceed. The game's ending is determined by whether or not the player has collected all the Crystal Shards by the time they defeat the boss of the sixth world. If the player has not collected all seventy-four shards, the player is treated to a bad ending, which includes a creepy stare from the Fairy Queen, giving the player the hint that there is still traces of Dark Matter left. If all shards have been collected, the seventh, final world will open, where the player can fight the true final boss and view the good ending of the game upon its defeat. Outside the single-player platforming, a multiplayer game mode can be accessed from the main menu. Here, up to four players can compete in three minigames: 100-Yard Hop, a race to the finish line; Bumper Crop Bump, a competition to collect food; and Checkerboard Chase, a last man standing game. Players can adjust the difficulty level and control Kirby, King Dedede, Adeleine, or Waddle Dee.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He crossed the sounds of House with hip hop breaks to create a more energized and popular sound that was able to reach commercial success outside the underground House scene. His productions extensively used samples that blend the sounds of classic disco, the Chicago house sound, and elements of hip-hop. Terry began his career in the 1980s, DJing at parties in New York. At first, he played Italo disco and hip-hop. Later he concentrated on House music upon its mid'80s emergence. He debuted as Masters at Work with the 12-inch \"Alright Alright\" and an edit from this was then included on the Chicago house vanguard compilation Jackmaster 1 . Much of Terry's early work in the late 1980s is considered a milestone in the development of house and rave music. He was responsible for releasing two of the house era's most respected crossover remixes: \"I'll House You\" by the Jungle Brothers and \"Missing\" by Everything but the Girl as a re-release in October 1995. His music was a driving force within the \"acid house\" scene in the UK with many tracks such as \"Back to the Beat\", \"Can You Party\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Weekend\", \"Party People\", \"Yeah, Buddy\" and \"Dreams of Santa-Anna\", released under multiple aliases including The Todd Terry Project, Royal House, Black Riot, Swan Lake and Orange Lemon. In the summer of 1988 at the peak of the UK acid house movement, \"Can You Party\" under his Royal House moniker reached No. 14 in the UK. Terry's notable releases during the 1990s include \"Something Goin' On\" and \"Keep on Jumpin'\", which were UK top-ten hits, with the vocals on both provided by Jocelyn Brown and Martha Wash. Freestyle artist Shannon was the featured vocalist on the UK top 20 hit \"It's Over Love\" in 1997, which topped the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs chart in the US, as did \"Just Wanna Dance / Weekend\". An album, Ready for a New Day, was also released in 1997, featuring \"Something Goin' On\", \"Keep on Jumpin'\" and \"It's Over Love\". It reached No. 84 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1996, he remixed \"Stranger in Moscow\" for Michael Jackson. In 1999, inspired by the Drum & Bass genre, Terry released Resolutions on Astralwerks Records. He also worked on the albums One Half of a Whole Decade and Live & Remastered. Throughout his career, Terry has used several aliases including Hard House, Swan Lake, Orange Lemon, Royal House, and Black Riot. As Black Riot, \"Warlock/A Day in the Life\" was released as a single on the Champion label and entered the UK Singles Chart on 3 December 1988, reaching a high of number 68. He also recorded under the monikers CLS, Masters at Work , Dredd Stock, House of Gypsies, Limelife, Tyme Forse, and the Gypsymen . Terry co-produced the song \"Shake\" on P.M. Dawn's debut album Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience. The song ended with the repeated lyric \"Everyone thank Todd Terry\". He also produced \"The House of Isis\" from Isis' 1990 album Rebel Soul. In October 2004, \"Weekend\" by the Todd Terry Project appeared in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on house music radio station SF-UR.

{"id": "91_23", "question": "What genre is The Cross?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

They were horror movies yet they had comedy, or they were comedies and yet they had horror. They were not comedy-mysteries, they were not comedy-thrillers, they were comedy-chillers.\" Wilder says when he started writing the film \"I knew I wanted it to be a comedy-chiller\", but he struggled and the film wound up as an \"autobiographical psycho/sexual comedy with music.\" Wilder and Radner fell in love while making Hanky Panky and he decided to revisit the project as a vehicle for them both. \"I always thought that Gilda has been one of our most brilliant television comediennes, but now I think she's becoming more than very good as a comic movie actress, which is a very, very different thing\", said Wilder. Wilder rewrote the script with writing partner, Terry Marsh. \"I knew that I wanted it to be not a parody and not a satire, but to re-create a comedy-chiller\", said Wilder. \"I don't like naturalism. I like things that are fantastical \u2013 I'm not saying necessarily fantasies, but more than reality.\" Wilder says the film was partly inspired by a song Jeanette MacDonald and Jack Buchanan sang in the film Monte Carlo . Wilder says he heard it while watching the film in bed with Radner. \"I'm always looking for some emotional spine to what I'm doing. I look over at her [Radner] and tears are coming down from her eyes. It was so sweet and innocent. Like little children. And I thought that's what this is about.\" \"I couldn't imagine him singing it with any other girl\", said Radner. \"So, I just had a tantrum and said I had to be the fiancee \u2013 not a big tantrum, just a tiny tantrum.\" He says he was also inspired by seeing Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast in the early 1980s. \"The world opened up for me\", he said. \"I'm more comfortable when I don't have to be held down by authenticity. In this film, which is set in the \u201930s, I feel that I'm presenting authenticity of the heart. I'm not interested in everyday reality, but in the reality of the heart. I like fantasy, like a fairy tale. I'm interested in shadows and contrasts. It's like the opening scene in the movie, when a character says, `It's not what you think.'

Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on-the-set rewrites. According to the director, \"Seven is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera\u00a0\u2013 and about what movies are or can be\". The crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film, as Fincher wanted to show a city that was \"dirty, violent, polluted, often depressing. Visually and stylistically, that's how we wanted to portray this world. Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible.\" To this end, Fincher turned to production designer Arthur Max to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants. \"We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it\", says Max. \"Everything is falling apart, and nothing is working properly.\" The film's brooding, dark look was achieved through a chemical process called bleach bypass, wherein the silver in the film stock was not completely removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality. The 'head in a box' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed. After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio, they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills' wife's head with that of a dog, or by not having Mills fire on John Doe. However, both Fincher and Pitt continued to fight for the original ending. The final scenes of Mills being taken away and Somerset's quote from Ernest Hemingway were filmed by Fincher after initial filming was complete as a way to placate the studio .", "hasanswer": false}]}

Chrome SpecForce is a strike force unit of the Federal Expeditionary Corps . They are tasked with maintaining the Federation's stability and keeping order. They are used for missions such as high-profile assassination, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage of enemy territory. The protagonist of the game is Logan, a member of SpecForce. The main goal of the game is to fight a corporation engaged in criminal activity on a planet called Estrella. SpecForce's members are given the latest equipment, such as Power Armor. The game has elements of strategy, large maps, and multiplayer. The gameplay in Chrome SpecForce is largely identical to that of Chrome, although it has been streamlined, while the overall difficulty has also been lowered. The player can survive significantly more damage , healing and ammo items are more common-place, and the control scheme has been condensed so as to require fewer separate commands. The plot is also simpler; cutscenes are minimal, with most of the story told in the mission briefings. The game serves as a prequel to Chrome, featuring Bolt Logan and Ron \"Pointer\" Hertz in their days as members of the military special forces. The two are sent to the planet Estrella to perform sabotage on the LoreGen corporation, who have been producing an illegal performance-enhancing stimulant derived from the planet's native dinosaur-like predators, and selling it to the mafia. However, the mission goes awry and the two are stranded on the planet when LoreGen succeeds in destroying their ship and killing the rest of their squad, including their commanding officer. The two meet Cartwright, a member of a local resistance movement fighting against LoreGen, and ally with the resistance to battle LoreGen. Cartwright is killed in a later mission, but Logan succeeds in disabling LoreGen's computer network with a computer virus, allowing the rebels to storm LoreGen's headquarters. Logan assists Weber, the leader of the resistance, in assaulting the LoreGen HQ. In the process, Logan succeeds in destroying LoreGen's stockpile of the stimulant as well as eliminating their prototype SW4 super-soldiers, Power Armor units boosted to superhuman levels with the stimulant. Logan finally defeats LoreGen's head of security, \"General\" Stanton, allowing the rebels to take the planet. Logan and Pointer contact the authorities to clean up the situation.

Joan says that she just witnessed her uncle, Harper's husband, loading bloody children and other people into the back of a lorry. After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place. Act 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one. Scene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe. Scene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract. Joan changes the subject and asks why Todd doesn't do something . He says he spends days wondering what he should do. Scene 4: Joan and Todd compliment each other on their almost completed hats. Todd announces he is going to talk to \"him\" . He says he is going to talk about the brother-in-law and hint at the possibility of leaking information to a friend of his who is a journalist. He say that if he lost his job, he'd miss Joan. Scene 5 shows the completed hats of Todd and Joan on the heads of prisoners being marched to have the hats \"judged\" in the trials. Scene 6 returns to the factory. Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd. Joan reminds Todd about the journalist he knows. Joan hypothesizes that the whole industry is corrupt. She says that if Todd is fired, she will resign. Todd almost tells Joan that he loves her, but quickly changes to saying that he loves beads. Act 3, Scene 1 finds Harper and Todd at Harper's house waiting for Joan to return.

In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". \"Mothership\" essentially means \"Main series\", where as \"Escort\" essentially means \"Spinoff\". One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock. It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock. Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues. Ireland's best selling musical act is the rock band U2, who have sold 170\u00a0million copies of their albums worldwide since their formation in 1976. There are a number of classical music ensembles around the country, such as the RT\u00c9 Performing Groups. Ireland also has two opera organisations: Irish National Opera in Dublin, and the annual Wexford Opera Festival, which promotes lesser-known operas, takes place during October and November. Ireland has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1965. Its first win was in 1970, when Dana won with All Kinds of Everything. It has subsequently won the competition six more times, the highest number of wins by any competing country. The phenomenon Riverdance originated as an interval performance during the 1994 contest. Irish dance can broadly be divided into social dance and performance dance. Irish social dance can be divided into c\u00e9il\u00ed and set dancing. Irish set dances are quadrilles, danced by 4 couples arranged in a square, while c\u00e9il\u00ed dances are danced by varied formations of couples of 2 to 16 people. There are also many stylistic differences between these two forms. Irish social dance is a living tradition, and variations in particular dances are found across the country. In some places dances are deliberately modified and new dances are choreographed. Performance dance is traditionally referred to as stepdance. Irish stepdance, popularised by the show Riverdance, is notable for its rapid leg movements, with the body and arms being kept largely stationary. The solo stepdance is generally characterised by a controlled but not rigid upper body, straight arms, and quick, precise movements of the feet. The solo dances can either be in \"soft shoe\" or \"hard shoe\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

He crossed the sounds of House with hip hop breaks to create a more energized and popular sound that was able to reach commercial success outside the underground House scene. His productions extensively used samples that blend the sounds of classic disco, the Chicago house sound, and elements of hip-hop. Terry began his career in the 1980s, DJing at parties in New York. At first, he played Italo disco and hip-hop. Later he concentrated on House music upon its mid'80s emergence. He debuted as Masters at Work with the 12-inch \"Alright Alright\" and an edit from this was then included on the Chicago house vanguard compilation Jackmaster 1 . Much of Terry's early work in the late 1980s is considered a milestone in the development of house and rave music. He was responsible for releasing two of the house era's most respected crossover remixes: \"I'll House You\" by the Jungle Brothers and \"Missing\" by Everything but the Girl as a re-release in October 1995. His music was a driving force within the \"acid house\" scene in the UK with many tracks such as \"Back to the Beat\", \"Can You Party\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Weekend\", \"Party People\", \"Yeah, Buddy\" and \"Dreams of Santa-Anna\", released under multiple aliases including The Todd Terry Project, Royal House, Black Riot, Swan Lake and Orange Lemon. In the summer of 1988 at the peak of the UK acid house movement, \"Can You Party\" under his Royal House moniker reached No. 14 in the UK. Terry's notable releases during the 1990s include \"Something Goin' On\" and \"Keep on Jumpin'\", which were UK top-ten hits, with the vocals on both provided by Jocelyn Brown and Martha Wash. Freestyle artist Shannon was the featured vocalist on the UK top 20 hit \"It's Over Love\" in 1997, which topped the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs chart in the US, as did \"Just Wanna Dance / Weekend\". An album, Ready for a New Day, was also released in 1997, featuring \"Something Goin' On\", \"Keep on Jumpin'\" and \"It's Over Love\". It reached No. 84 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1996, he remixed \"Stranger in Moscow\" for Michael Jackson. In 1999, inspired by the Drum & Bass genre, Terry released Resolutions on Astralwerks Records. He also worked on the albums One Half of a Whole Decade and Live & Remastered. Throughout his career, Terry has used several aliases including Hard House, Swan Lake, Orange Lemon, Royal House, and Black Riot. As Black Riot, \"Warlock/A Day in the Life\" was released as a single on the Champion label and entered the UK Singles Chart on 3 December 1988, reaching a high of number 68. He also recorded under the monikers CLS, Masters at Work , Dredd Stock, House of Gypsies, Limelife, Tyme Forse, and the Gypsymen . Terry co-produced the song \"Shake\" on P.M. Dawn's debut album Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience. The song ended with the repeated lyric \"Everyone thank Todd Terry\". He also produced \"The House of Isis\" from Isis' 1990 album Rebel Soul. In October 2004, \"Weekend\" by the Todd Terry Project appeared in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on house music radio station SF-UR.

As they study it further, the zone expands and soon envelops the Enterprise, leaving them in a black void with sensors reporting complete nothingness outside. Picard orders the ship on a return course, but they find that they cannot escape; they leave a stationary beacon behind them, only to have it reappear ahead of them again. A Romulan Warbird suddenly decloaks in front of the ship and attacks, and Picard orders the crew to return fire; they destroy the Warbird, but Picard is suspicious of how easily this occurs. The crew then detect what appears to be their sister ship, the USS Yamato, approaching, but it does not respond to hails. Commander Riker and Lt. Worf beam over to search the ship, where they find it empty with various inconsistencies in its construction, including more seemingly impossible physical loops. The Enterprise then detects an exit from the darkness, but cannot lock onto the away team to retrieve them before the opening disappears. The Yamato begins to fade away, but the Enterprise is able to beam Riker and Worf back just in time. More openings appear in the blackness, each closing as soon as the Enterprise approaches them. Picard realizes that they are being manipulated, and orders a full stop. Suddenly, an entity with a distorted, almost childlike face as a result of it attempting to look humanoid, appears in the void, calling itself Nagilum. It announces its curiosity about humans and their \"limited existence\" and would like to test the limits of the human body. It causes Ensign Haskell to experience violent convulsions, and he then falls to the floor dead. Nagilum then states that it wants to know everything about death, asserting that it would take between a third and a half of the Enterprises crew to complete its experiments. Picard decides to activate the ship's self-destruct sequence rather than to submit to Nagilum's whims. As the crew prepares for their end, Picard is tested again by Nagilum through peculiar behavior displayed by doppelgangers of Counselor Troi and Lt. Commander Data, both of whom question the self-destruct order. After these facsimiles are gone and the countdown nears zero, the void suddenly vanishes, leaving the Enterprise in normal space.

{"id": "91_58", "question": "What genre is Enter?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting\u2014rhetorically\u2014that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\". A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\". Poe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work in Continental Europe. Poe's early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H.\u00a0G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell. Horror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft stated, \"When I write stories, Edgar Allan Poe is my model.\" Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films\". Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators. One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook. Even so, Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\", and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\". Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"\u2014the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger. It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He had clearly started work by 25 August, writing to a friend, \"If this don't fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my day. Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the Admiral Benbow public house on the [Devon] coast, that it's all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a derelict ship... It's quite silly and horrid fun \u2013 and what I want is the best book about Buccaneers that can be had\". Stevenson originally gave the book the title The Sea Cook. One month after conceiving of the book, chapters began to appear in the pages of the Young Folks magazine. After completing fifteen or nineteen chapters rapidly, Stevenson was interrupted by illness; he left Scotland and continued working on the first draft near London, where he and his father discussed points of the tale, and his father suggested elements that he included. The novel eventually ran in seventeen weekly instalments from October 1, 1881, to January 28, 1882. The book was later republished as the novel Treasure Island and proved to be Stevenson's first financial and critical success. The Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who served four terms as British Prime Minister between 1868 and 1894, was one of the book's biggest fans. Two general types of sea novels were popular during the 19th century: the navy yarn, which places a capable officer in adventurous situations amid realistic settings and historical events, and the desert island romance, which features shipwrecked or marooned characters confronted by treasure-seeking pirates or angry natives. Around 1815, the latter genre became one of the most popular fictional styles in Great Britain, perhaps because of the philosophical interest in Rousseau and Chateaubriand's \"noble savage\". Treasure Island was a climax of this development. The growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to 1719 when Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe was published. A century later, novels such as S. H. Burney's The Shipwreck , and Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate continued to expand upon Defoe's classic. Other authors, in the mid-19th century, continued this trend, with works including James Fenimore Cooper's The Pilot . During the same period, Edgar Allan Poe wrote, \"MS Found in a Bottle\" and \"The Gold-Bug\" . All of these works influenced Stevenson's end product. Stevenson also consciously borrowed material from previous authors. In a July 1884 letter to Sidney Colvin, he wrote that \"Treasure Island came out of Kingsley's At Last, where I got the Dead Man's Chest\u2014and that was the seed\u2014and out of the great Captain Johnson's History of the Notorious Pirates\". Stevenson also admits that he took the idea of Captain Flint's pointing skeleton from Poe's The Gold-Bug and he constructed Billy Bones' history from the \"Money-Diggers\" section of Tales of a Traveller by Washington Irving, one of his favorite writers. Half of Stevenson's manuscripts are lost, including those of Treasure Island, The Black Arrow, and The Master of Ballantrae. Stevenson's heirs sold his papers during World War I; many of his documents were auctioned off in 1918.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although overnight figures had shown a slight decrease from the previous episode, the final numbers showed that the ratings were the highest seen so far during season two and the third week of increased ratings for Enterprise in succession. This meant that 6.26 million viewers watched the episode, an increase of 860,000 viewers from the previous week's episode, making it the highest viewed episode since season one's \"Sleeping Dogs\". Alexander Chase at USA Today said the numbers \"confirm a ratings turnaround for the newest Trek series\". The episode placed Enterprise fourth in a list of the most highly rated science fiction or fantasy genre shows on television for that week, behind Alias, Smallville, and John Doe. Herc of Ain't It Cool News, rated the episode 3 out of 5, praised the story about how Porthos was named and the elements of sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol. He thought the Odd Couple type relationship between Archer and Phlox did not worked all the time, that there were too many misfires in the comedic elements, and the episode was repeating things that had already \"Been seen done.\" Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation, said she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. She criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by \"what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde\". Jamahl Epsicokhan of \"Jammer's Reviews\" called it \"easily the dumbest concept for an episode of Star Trek since Voyager holodeck was hijacked by the residents of Fair Haven\", and gave it a score of 1 out of 4. He felt that the episode made a mockery out of the characters and that some of the situations they were placed in were just ridiculous. TechRepublic included the episode on its list of the 5 worst episodes of Enterprise. In 2016, SyFy included this episode in a group of Star Trek franchise episodes they felt were commonly disliked but \"deserved a second chance\". In 2017, ScreenRant ranked \"A Night in Sickbay\" the 14th worst Star Trek episode highlighting what they felt were poor character development choices and a weak plot that revolved around a  sick dog that peed on a tree. IGN called it \"The hands-down worst show of the season\". WhatCulture ranked this episode the 17th worst episode of Star Trek. In 2021, The Digital Fix felt this was a \"bad episode\" but noted it for experimenting with format. Den of Geek defended the episode, saying it was flawed but nowhere near as bad as \"Spock's Brain\" or \" Threshold\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

In addition to vocalist Reese Roper, the band was formed by fellow Five Iron member Sonnie Johnston , Ethan Luck , John Warne , and Josh Abbott . The project yielded only a three-track EP, Ride, Rope and Destroy, released in 2004. It has been confirmed by both Ethan Luck and Reese Roper that there never was a fourth, unreleased song recorded for the EP. Reese Roper often compared the sound of the band to Letters to Cleo. Their name was a play on the Rage Against the Machine single \"Guerrilla Radio\". When the Guerilla Rodeo project came to an end, Reese reformed the band under his own name, Roper. Roper's full-length album, Brace Yourself for the Mediocre, was produced before the band was officially together and released on Five Minute Walk Records. All songs on the album with the exception of \"Day of Pigs\" and \"You're Still The One\" were written by Reese Roper, Masaki Liu, and Ethan Luck. Because of the incomplete state of the band at the time of the album's release, the only official member appearing on the CD is Reese Roper. As a result, the album features many additional musicians such as Frank Lenz , Elijah Thomson , Phil Bennett , Bob Schiveley , Masaki Liu , Jason White , Ethan Luck , and many additional vocalists. Some of the songs on the album were originally written for Guerilla Rodeo.  One of the online forums spawned by this group is the Roper Board in which many fans of both Roper and Reese's previous band Five Iron Frenzy congregate. Roper issued a statement regarding the status of the band in 2006: In 2009 Reese Roper told HM that the probability of making another album was \"somewhere around 3%.\" The Roper project sold close to 30,000 albums in total, about the same as Brave Saint Saturn and other Five Iron related side projects.

In 1990, Hill's wife, Hildy Gottlieb, had left her job as an agent to head up Alec Baldwin's production company, Meadowbrook Productions. Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence. But at the same time, how else are we going to make a film that faithfully mirrors the truth out there in our society? This is a story about misfits in a world of misfits.

R&H focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that \"This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where you were going to get a really long look at the water and what it was doing.\" The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007. Rhythm & Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots. R&H was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements. In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&H and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months. Andy Arnett, the animation supervisor, declared that \"The research was extensive. It took six or seven months to perfect the look and feel of the animals before we had the first shot out the door.\" For the scene in Congressman Long's office, CGI was used the entire time for the fish that follow Evan around from the fish tank. Cafe FX, the visual effects company hired for the scene, ordered ten different kinds of tropical fish from a local store and studied their movements to imitate them on screen using computer animation. Jeff Goldman, the visual effects supervisor, stated \"Early in the sequence, we mimicked the actual behavior of the fish in our animation, but as the scene plays out, the fish are a counterpoint to Steve Carell's comedic timing.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Originally released for the PlayStation in 1996 in Japan and North America, the title was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1999. A port to the PlayStation Portable retitled Shin Megami Tensei: Persona was released in North America and Japan in 2009, and the following year in Europe. This port featured new cutscenes and a reworked English localization that was more faithful to the original Japanese release. The PlayStation version was also released for the PlayStation Classic on December 3, 2018 worldwide, marking the PlayStation version being released in Europe for the first time. The story focuses on a group of high school students as they are confronted by a series of supernatural incidents. After playing a fortune-telling game, the group each gain the ability to summon Personas, the multiple selves within them. Using this power under the guidance of Philemon, a benevolent being representing humanity's subconscious, the group face off against multiple forces that threaten the world. Gameplay revolves around the characters navigating environments around their town and fighting enemies using their Personas. During the course of the game, the player can create new Personas for battle using spell cards gained in battle or by talking with enemies.

{"id": "91_80", "question": "What genre is Twelve?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_3638", "text": "During his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting\u2014rhetorically\u2014that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\". A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\". Poe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work in Continental Europe. Poe's early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H.\u00a0G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell. Horror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft stated, \"When I write stories, Edgar Allan Poe is my model.\" Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films\". Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators. One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook. Even so, Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\", and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\". Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"\u2014the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger. It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Priest's writing is gripping, and it's one of those rare books that reveal what writing is: manner and matter twinned and entwined.\" Elizabeth Hand described the book as \"exquisite ... an exceptionally frightening novel whose nightmare power derives from its chilling, almost clinical evocation of an historical reality with which we are all familiar, the London Blitz... a cliffhanger narrative of dual identities, betrayals, and shifting realities, as two versions of the twins' histories\u2014and England's, and the world's\u2014are woven together, like strands of DNA, to form a terrifying narrative. Priest has used doubles before to great effect, in his award-winning novel The Prestige; but The Separation trumps even that tale. Its chapters linger in the mind like scenes from a Hitchcock film, impossible to shake off; like Hitchcock's work, The Separation begs for repeated readings to appreciate the cold brilliance and execution of its intricate plot fully. A masterly novel that deserves to become a classic.\" Publishers Weekly called it a \"subtle, unsettling alternative WWII history\": \"Convincingly detailed diaries, scraps of published texts, declassified transcripts and more baffle a historian who tries to reconcile different realities. The brothers themselves recognize the uncertainty of motives and actions; Joe in particular struggles to believe that he's making a better future even though he realizes how much it costs him personally. Many alternative history novels are bloodless extrapolations from mountains of data, but this one quietly builds characters you care about\u2014then leaves their dilemmas unresolved as they try to believe that what they have done is 'right'.\" Pauline Morgan, reviewing the novel for SF Crowsnest.com, said, \"This is a glorious book to read\u2014not for nothing was Christopher Priest included in the line-up of Britain's best young novelists some years ago. The Separation does what so few books do these days, whatever genre they are written in; it encourages the reader to think.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream. She introduced the world to this community who, up until that point in time, had been a subculture.\" Vogueing has since become a prominent dance form practised worldwide, and many performers have followed Madonna's footsteps, with Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Azealia Banks all adopting the dance style and incorporating it into their music videos and performances. South Korean singer Luna's song \"Madonna\" referenced \"Vogue\" on its lyrics, \"When I grow up, I wanna be like Madonna / When I grow up, I wanna vogue how I wanna\". The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song \"was instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" \"Vogue\" has inspired flash mobs around the US.

S.H.E's other contributions include songs in the soundtracks of Magical Love, The Rose, Reaching for the Stars, Tokyo Juliet, The Little Fairy, Hanazakarino Kimitachihe, and Bull Fighting. In 2008, they sang the ending theme for the film CJ7. The group is also known for harmonizing between each other, but has no designated lead singer and has no leader. All three members have different vocal ranges to complement each other. Ella sings within the alto to mezzo-soprano range, while Hebe and Selina sing within the mezzo-soprano to soprano range, with Ella having the widest vocal range of the three. Most S.H.E songs fall into the category of pop music. Songs from this genre consist of light melodies, simple drum beats, and the occasional piano or synthesizer accompaniment. In Girls Dorm and Youth Society, acoustic guitar melody lines were used as well. While some slower songs, particularly those in Genesis, fall into the genre of R&B, high-tempo songs, such as \"Beauty Up My Life\", focus more on techno. S.H.E has also sung a few pop/rock songs, including \"Piquancy\" , \"Super Star\", and \"Star Light\" . As their career progressed, S.H.E began mixing light-hearted pop ballads with elements of hip hop and dance.

Their hits included \"Flat Foot Floogie \", \"Cement Mixer \" and the hipster anthem \"The Groove Juice Special \". The duo performs in the 1941 movie Hellzapoppin'. Gaillard's appeal was similar to Cab Calloway's and Louis Jordan's in that he presented a hip style with broad appeal . Unlike them, he was a master improviser whose stream of consciousness vocals ranged far from the original lyrics. He sang wild interpolations of nonsense syllables, such as \"MacVoutie O-reeney\". One such performance is celebrated in the 1957 novel On the Road by Jack Kerouac. Gaillard, with Dodo Marmarosa on piano, appeared as a guest several times on Command Performance, recorded at KNX radio studios in Hollywood in the 1940s and distributed on transcription discs to American troops in World War II. In 1943, Gaillard was drafted in the United States Army Air Forces and \"qualified as a pilot flying [...] B-26 bombers in the Pacific\" and resumed his music career on his release from the draft in 1944. Upon his return he released the song Atomic Cocktail, which featured seemingly lighthearted lyrics laced with symbolism about nuclear war. Gaillard later teamed with bassist Bam Brown. They can be seen in a 1947 motion picture featurette O'Voutie O'Rooney filmed live at one of their nightclub performances. Slim and Bam was featured at the first Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles that was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on September 23, 1945, along with Count Basie. Gaillard also played for the 2nd Cavalcade of Jazz held at Wrigley Field on October 12, 1946, and played for the 3rd Cavalcade of Jazz held also at Wrigley Field on September 7, 1947. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Gaillard frequently opened at Birdland for Charlie Parker, Flip Phillips, and Coleman Hawkins. His December 1945 session with Parker and Dizzy Gillespie is notable, both musically and for its relaxed convivial air. \"Slim's Jam\", from that session, is one of the earliest known recordings of Parker's speaking voice.  In 1949 he was playing in San Francisco.  Near the end of Part Two of Jack Kerouac's book On the Road is an account of meeting him at a performance there. Gaillard could play several instruments and managed to turn the performance from jazz to comedy. He would play the guitar with his left hand fretting with fingers pointing down over the fingerboard , or would play credible piano solos with his palms facing up. Gaillard wrote the theme song to the Peter Potter radio show. In addition, in 1950 he wrote and recorded the \"Don Pitts On the Air\" theme for San Francisco DJ Don Pitts. On March 27, 2008, the Pitts theme song entered the archives of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. In the early 1960s, Gaillard lived in San Diego, California. During that time he recorded several singles and performed with local bands. Under the name Slim Delgado, he recorded a rock and roll single for the Xavier label titled \"Frank Rhoads Round.\" Gaillard appeared in several shows in the 1960s and 1970s, such as Marcus Welby, M.D., Charlie's Angels, Mission: Impossible, Medical Center, The Flip Wilson Show, and Then Came Bronson. He also appeared in the 1970s TV series Roots: The Next Generations and reprised some of his old hits on the NBC prime-time variety program The Chuck Barris Rah Rah Show. By the early 1980s Gaillard was touring the European jazz festival circuit, playing with such musicians as Arnett Cobb. He also played with George Melly and John Chilton's Feetwarmers, appearing on their BBC television series and also occasionally deputising for Melly when he was unwell. Gaillard's behavior on stage was often erratic and nerve-wracking for the accompanying musicians. He made a guest appearance on Show 106 of the 1980s music program Night Music, an NBC late-night music series hosted by David Sanborn. Around Christmas 1985, Gaillard recorded the album Siboney at Gateway Studios in Battersea, London, produced by Joe Massot. As Massot recalled later: In 1986, Gaillard appeared in the musical film Absolute Beginners, singing \"Selling Out\". In the autumn of 1989, the BBC aired director Anthony Wall's four-part documentary on Gaillard entitled Slim Gaillard's Civilisation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\" Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

{"id": "91_98", "question": "What genre is Focus?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly: NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two\u00a0hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode.

{"id": "91_100", "question": "What genre is ALF?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_25463", "text": "Producer Bernie Brillstein was approached to see Fusco's audition with a puppet character but was initially uninterested, having managed Jim Henson for years and regarding Henson as the best puppeteer in showbiz. However, Fusco's brief performance as ALF won over Brillstein, who thought the character was hilarious and strong enough to be the focus of a series. Fusco co-produced the series with Tom Patchett. Patchett also co-created, wrote, and directed the series. The series was first syndicated by Warner Bros. Television and Lorimar-Telepictures. The US syndication rights are currently owned by Debmar-Mercury as its parent company, Lionsgate, now owns home video rights. Due to the inherent nature of producing a show featuring hand-operated puppets , ALF was technically difficult and extremely demanding on series creator Fusco as well as its four lead actors. All confirmed during a 2000 People magazine interview that there were constantly high levels of tension on the set. Max Wright stated that he despised supporting a technically demanding inanimate object that received most of the good lines of dialogue. He admitted to being \"hugely eager to have ALF over with.\" Artie Lange, who later worked with Wright on The Norm Show, told of a time when Wright had become \"crazed\" and physically attacked ALF, causing producers to have to pull Wright off the puppet. Anne Schedeen said that on the last night of taping the final episode, \"there was one take and Max walked off the set, went to his dressing room, got his bags, went to his car and disappeared... There were no goodbyes.\" Schedeen herself said \"there was no joy on the set...it was a technical nightmare\u00a0\u2013 extremely slow, hot and tedious... A 30-minute show took 20, 25 hours to shoot.\" While fond of her on-screen children, Schedeen said some adults had \"difficult personalities. The whole thing was a big dysfunctional family.\" Schedeen added, \"It's astonishing that ALF really was wonderful and that word never got out what a mess our set really was.\" Andrea Elson, who suffered from bulimia during the second season of shooting, stated, \"If ALF had gone one more year, everybody would have lost it.\" Wright later admitted that as the years passed he looked back at ALF with less animosity and conceded that \"It doesn't matter what I felt or what the days were like, ALF brought people a lot of joy.\" In reference to the tension, Fusco commented in 2012 that \"It was just the nature of the beast. There was no way we could have made it go any further or any faster,\" he insisted. \"I think it was frustrating that it would take so long, but people got paid for what they did. Despite what people thought, that there was a lot of tension on set, there really wasn't.\" Fusco was notoriously secretive about his character up until the series' premiere. During the show's production, Fusco refused to acknowledge that the puppet ALF was anything other than an alien. All involved with the production were cautioned not to reveal any of ALF's production secrets. The set was built on a platform raised four feet above the ground, with trap doors constructed at many points so that ALF could appear almost anywhere; Fusco operated him from underneath, so the unoccupied holes all over the floor were deep and treacherous. The trap doors had to be reset multiple times, sometimes during a single scene. Principal puppeteer Paul Fusco used his left hand to control ALF's mouth, while his right hand controlled ALF's right arm. Another puppeteer, Lisa Buckley, who would go on to perform on Sesame Street, assisted Fusco beneath the stage, operating ALF's left arm. At times when ALF's full body was shown in the sitting position, Lisa controlled ALF's left hand by cable allowing slight finger movements. There was additionally a third puppeteer, Bob Fappiano, who controlled ALF's facial and ear movements via a radio control offscreen. During tapings, Fusco would wear a head-mounted microphone to record ALF's voice. The process resulted in numerous mistakes and retakes, making it impossible to record ALF in front of a live audience. A laugh track was added during post-production. To avoid wear and tear on the principal ALF puppet, the performers rehearsed with a crude early version of ALF, nicknamed \"RALF\" For . Fusco did not like to rehearse, and would often substitute his hand or RALF for the real ALF puppet during rehearsals. In an interview on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Tina Fey said that her biggest frustration as producer of NBC's 75th-anniversary special was dealing with ALF's \"people\". Fey said Fusco would only allow ALF to appear on the show if the puppeteers were hidden from everyone else. After ALF's cameo alongside former Family Ties star Michael Gross, ALF disappeared through a hole in the riser, was stuffed into a case, and immediately removed from the building. While a puppet was usually used for ALF, there were some shots of the tiny alien running or walking around. This was accomplished by the 2' 9\" actor Michu Meszaros wearing an ALF costume. This can be seen in one of the series' intros, which concludes with the Tanner family getting their picture taken; ALF walks over to be part of the photo. However, Meszaros' services became too costly as well as time-consuming, and the full ALF costume was abandoned after the first season. ALF scored its highest ratings during Season 2 . Ratings remained at a steady fifteenth place during Season 3, but plummeted to 39th place during Season 4. NBC moved the show from its traditional Monday night slot to Saturday in March 1990 and eventually moved to Sunday, but ratings continued to fall. The season-ending cliffhanger \"Consider Me Gone\" became an unintentional series finale when NBC gave Alien Productions a verbal commitment for a fifth season, but ultimately withdrew its support. ABC resolved the cliffhanger on February 17, 1996, with the TV movie Project: ALF. NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff later told Fusco that the network regretted cancelling ALF prematurely, saying \"It was a big mistake that we cancelled your show, because you guys had at least one or two more seasons left.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on reviews from 257 critics, with a rating average of 7.40/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Wickedly funny and featuring plenty of gore, Zombieland is proof that the zombie subgenre is far from dead.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds a score of 73 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore during the opening weekend, gave Zombieland an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert was surprised by Zombielands ability to be significantly humorous while zombies remained the focus of the film, and felt that \"all of this could have been dreary, but not here. The filmmakers show invention and well-tuned comic timing\". He credited Bill Murray's cameo appearance as receiving the \"single biggest laugh\" of the year and gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Murray's cameo was called out for attention by other reviewers: Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle credited it as \"the single most outrageously entertaining unexpected celebrity cameo of any film\u2014genre or otherwise\u2014\" that he had seen in a \"long, long time\" and that while the film did little to advance the genre, its smart script and high action made it very enjoyable. Savlov categorized Zombieland as being \"dead set against being dead serious\" with its tonal pallor \"ha[ving] more in common with a foreshortened It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World than with 28 Days or Weeks Later\". The film's witty use of dialogue and popular culture was also praised by Ty Burr of The Boston Globe, who said the film \"makes no claims to greatness\", but that what it \"has instead\u2014in spades\u2014is deliciously weary end-of-the-world banter\". Michael Ordona of Los Angeles Times praised director Fleischer for \"bring[ing] impeccable timing and bloodthirsty wit to the proceedings\". Some reviewers saw deeper levels in the plot and cinematography; cinematographer Michael Bonvillain was praised for capturing \"some interesting images amid the postapocalyptic carnival of carnage, as when he transforms the destruction of a souvenir shop into a rough ballet\", while Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com said, \"the picture is beautifully paced\" and highlighted \"a halcyon middle section where, in what could be viewed as a sideways homage to Rebel Without a Cause, our rootless wanderers share a brief respite in an empty, lavish mansion\". Claudia Puig of USA Today said, \"underlying the carnage in Zombieland is a sweetly beating heart\", and, \"This road movie/horror flick/dark comedy/earnest romance/action film hybrid laces a gentle drollness through all the bloody mayhem\". Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum concluded, \"At the bone, Zombieland is a polished, very funny road picture shaped by wisenheimer cable-TV sensibilities and starring four likable actors, each with an influential following\". Josh Levin of Slate drew parallels with Adventureland: in both films, Jesse Eisenberg tries to win over his dream girl, a girl who has been hardened by life, and both feature a theme park. He goes so far as to call the film \"an undead Adventureland\u2014a Pride and Prejudice and Zombies for the Facebook generation\". Time's Richard Corliss described the film as \"an exhilarating ride, start to finish\" and reasoned \"Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg set a high bar for this subgenre with Shaun of the Dead, but Reese, Wernick, and Fleischer may have trumped them\". \"This isn't just a good zombie comedy. It's a damn fine movie, period. And that's high praise, coming from a vampire guy\", he stated. Not all comparisons with Shaun of the Dead were favorable: Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York characterized the \"extra injection of pop-culture neuroticism\" as \"the one innovation\" of the film, declaring that while Zombieland was funny, it was not particularly scary and stated that it \"simply isn't as witty as Shaun of the Dead, forever the yuks-meet-yucks standard\". Similarly, The Globe and Mails Rick Groen said \"it's far more charming than chilling and way more funny than frightening\", though he suggested that Rule No. 32 to 'enjoy the little things' was worth observing for a light comedy. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times classified the film as \"[a] minor diversion dripping in splatter and groaning with self-amusement\" and lamented the lack of a real plot more concrete than a series of comedy takes on zombie-slaying.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In recent times and to date Botswana has seen a remarkable appearance of distinguished writers whose genres range from historical, political and witty story writing. Prominent amongst these are the South African-born Bessie Head, who settled in Serowe; Andrew Sesinyi; Barolong Seboni ; Unity Dow, Galesiti Baruti; Caitlin Davies; Lauri Kubuetsile; Albert Malikongwa; Toro Mositi; and Moteane Melamu.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_117", "question": "What genre is Nine Inch Nails?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_17502", "text": "Formation In 1987 in Cleveland, Ohio, Trent Reznor played keyboards in the Exotic Birds, a synthpop band managed by John Malm Jr. Reznor became friends with Malm, who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios. Studio owner Bart Koster granted Reznor free access to the studio between bookings to record demos, commenting that it cost him nothing more than \"a little wear on [his] tape heads\". Unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired, but inspired by Prince, Reznor played all the instruments except drums himself. He has continued to play most parts on Nine Inch Nails recordings ever since. The first Nine Inch Nails performance took place at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio, on October 21, 1988, as part of the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. In 1988, after playing supporting Skinny Puppy, Reznor aimed to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine demos, recorded live in November 1988 and collectively known as Purest Feeling, were released in revised form on the first studio album, Pretty Hate Machine . The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar, as well as a heavier use of film samples. Reznor chose the name \"Nine Inch Nails\" because it \"abbreviated easily\" rather than for \"any literal meaning\". Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to reference Jesus' crucifixion with nine-inch spikes, or Freddy Krueger's nine-inch fingernails. The English letters \"NIN\" are also noted for their resemblance to the modern Hebrew characters of the Tetragrammaton.  The Nine Inch Nails logo first appeared on the music video for their debut single, \"Down in It\". Reznor and Gary Talpas designed the logo, inspired by Tibor Kalman's typography on the Talking Heads album Remain in Light. Talpas, a native of Cleveland, continued to design Nine Inch Nails packaging until 1997. Pretty Hate Machine Written, arranged, and performed by Reznor, Nine Inch Nails' first album Pretty Hate Machine debuted in 1989. It marked his first collaboration with Adrian Sherwood and Mark \"Flood\" Ellis. Reznor asked Sean Beavan to mix the demos of Pretty Hate Machine, which had received multiple offers for record deals. He mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails' live concerts for several years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band and singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console. Flood's production would appear on each major Nine Inch Nails release until 1994, and Sherwood has made remixes for the band as recently as 2000. Reznor and his co-producers expanded upon the Right Track Studio demos by adding singles \"Head Like a Hole\" and \"Sin\". Rolling Stone's Michael Azerrad described the album as \"industrial-strength noise over a pop framework\" and \"harrowing but catchy music\"; Reznor proclaimed this combination \"a sincere statement\" of \"what was in [his] head at the time\". In fact, the song \"Down in It\" spent over two months on Billboard club-play dance chart. After spending 113 weeks on the Billboard 200, Pretty Hate Machine became one of the first independently released records to attain platinum certification. Three music videos were created in promotion of the album. MTV aired the videos for \"Down in It\" and \"Head Like a Hole\", but an explicit video for \"Sin\" was only released in partial form for Closure. The original version of the \"Down in It\" video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the FBI. In 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band members were asked what shows they would like to appear on. They jokingly replied that they would like to appear on Dance Party USA, since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance. In 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series, in which it toured North America as an opening act for alternative rock artists such as Peter Murphy and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Reznor began smashing his equipment while on stage; Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band's early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude. Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first Lollapalooza festival in 1991. Broken After a poor European reception opening for Guns N' Roses, the band returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine. After finding out they were hindering control of his project, Reznor criticized the labeling of Nine Inch Nails as a commercially oriented band and demanded his label terminate his contract, but they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. Involved in a feud with TVT, he signed a record deal with Interscope Records and created Nothing Records: We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on. In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to 10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles , the site of the Tate murders, when Charles Manson's \"family\" murdered Sharon Tate, wife of noted film director Roman Polanski, and four of her friends. The band used it to record Broken, an extended play that was the first Nine Inch Nails release distributed by Interscope Records and reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200. In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 Nine Inch Nails touring band as an influence on the EP's sound. He characterized Broken as a guitar-based \"blast of destruction\", and as \"a lot harder\u00a0... than Pretty Hate Machine\". The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza. Songs from Broken earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP's first single \"Happiness in Slavery\" from Woodstock '94, and the second single \"Wish\". In reference to receiving the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for \"Wish\", Reznor joked that \"Wish\" became \"the only song to ever win a Grammy that says 'fist fuck' in the lyrics.\" Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label. Peter Christopherson of the bands Coil and Throbbing Gristle directed a performance video for \"Wish\", but the EP's most controversial video accompanied \"Happiness in Slavery\". The video was almost universally banned for its graphic depiction of performance artist Bob Flanagan disrobed and lying on a machine that pleasures, tortures, then kills him. A third video for \"Pinion\", partially incorporated into MTV's Alternative Nation opening sequence, showed a toilet that apparently flushes into the mouth of a person in bondage. Reznor and Christopherson compiled the three clips along with footage for \"Help Me I Am in Hell\" and \"Gave Up\" into a longform music video titled Broken.  It depicts the murder of a young man who is kidnapped and tortured while forced to watch the videos. This footage was never officially released, but instead appeared covertly among tape trading circles. A separate performance video for \"Gave Up\" featuring Richard Patrick and Marilyn Manson was filmed at Le Pig. A live recording of \"Wish\" was also filmed, and both videos appeared in Closure. Broken was followed by the companion remix EP Fixed in late 1992. The only track that was left off the final version of the release is the remix of \"Last\", produced by Butch Vig . The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11\u00a0kHz file, \"NIN_LAST.AIFF\", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks at remix.nin.com). Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying \"I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage.\" The Downward Spiral Early ideas for The Downward Spiral arose after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival's concerts ended in September. Reznor elaborated the album's themes into lyrics. Despite initially choosing to record the album in New Orleans, Reznor searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, in Los Angeles renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, the start of the making of both Broken and The Downward Spiral. Nine Inch Nails' second studio album, The Downward Spiral, entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and is the band's highest seller in the US, over four million copies, among five million worldwide. Influenced by Pink Floyd and by David Bowie of the 1970s, The Downward Spiral's diverse textures and moods depict a protagonist's mental progress. Flood co-produced several tracks, while Alan Moulder mixed most, and later found more extensive production duties on future albums. Reznor invited Sean Beavan to work on The Downward Spiral. After contributing to remixes of Nine Inch Nails songs, such as \"Closer\", Beavan mixed and co-produced Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar in 1996. The Downward Spiral, alike Broken, was recorded at Le Pig Studios. \"March of the Pigs\" and \"Closer\" were singles. Two other tracks, \"Hurt\" and \"Piggy\", though not singles, were issued to radio. Also in 1994, the band released the promotional single \"Burn\", which Reznor produced, on the soundtrack of Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. as well as a cover of the Joy Division song \"Dead Souls\" on the soundtrack to the film The Crow, which went to number 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The music video for \"Closer\", directed by Mark Romanek, was in MTV's frequent rotation, although the network, deeming it too graphic, heavily censored the original. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pig's head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S&M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag.  A radio edit that partially mutes the song's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime. Contemporary critics generally praised The Downward Spiral, now classed among the most important albums of the 1990s. In 2005, Spin ranked it 25th among the \"100 Greatest Albums, 1985\u20132005\". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it 200 among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Blender named it the 80th Greatest American Album. It was ranked No.\u00a0488 in the book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time by Martin Popoff. In 2001 Q named The Downward Spiral as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time; in 2010 the album was ranked No.\u00a0102 on their 250 Best Albums of Q's Lifetime list. After The Downward Spiral's release, Reznor produced an accompanying remix album entitled Further Down the Spiral, the only non-major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified gold in the United States and among the best-selling remix albums of all time. It contained contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde, electronic musician Aphex Twin, producer Rick Rubin, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, among others. After The Downward Spiral's 1994 release, the live band supported it by embarking on the Self Destruct Tour. The stage set-up featured dirty curtains, rising and lowering for visuals shown during songs such as \"Hurt\". The tour debuted the band's grungy, messy image as the members appeared in ragged attire slathered in corn starch. Performances were violent and chaotic, band members often injuring themselves by attacking each other, diving into the crowd, and destroying their instruments to close. The widest mainstream audience was a mud-soaked performance at Woodstock '94, and seen by Pay-Per-View in up to 24\u00a0million homes. Enjoying mainstream success thereafter, Nine Inch Nails then performed amid greater production values, adding theatrical visual elements. Supporting acts on tour included The Jim Rose Circus and Marilyn Manson. Released in 1997, the Closure video documented highlights from the tour, including full live videos of \"Eraser\", \"Hurt\" and a one-take \"March of the Pigs\" clip directed by Peter Christoperson. In 1997 Reznor also produced the soundtrack to the David Lynch film Lost Highway, which featured one new Nine Inch Nails song, \"The Perfect Drug\". Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of The Fragile. The Fragile Five years elapsed between The Downward Spiral and Nine Inch Nails' next studio album, The Fragile, which arrived as a double album in September 1999. The Fragile was conceived by making \"songwriting and arranging and production and sound design\u00a0... the same thing. A song would start with a drum loop or a visual and eventually a song would emerge out of it and that was the song.\" Canadian rock producer Bob Ezrin was consulted on the album's track listing; the liner notes state that he \"provided final continuity and flow.\" On the heels of the band's previous successes, media anticipation surrounded The Fragile more than a year before its release, when it was already described as \"oft-delayed\". The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 228,000 copies in its first week and receiving generally positive reviews. Spin hailed The Fragile as the \"album of the year\", whereas Pitchfork Media panned its \"melodramatic\" lyrics. Nine Inch Nails released three commercial singles from the album in different territories: \"The Day the World Went Away\" in North America; \"We're in This Together\" in the EU and Japan ; and \"Into the Void\" in Australia. Several songs from the album became regulars on alternative rock radio stations, however the album dropped to number 16 and slipped out of the Billboard Top 10 only a week after its release, resulting in the band setting a record for the biggest drop from number one, which has since been broken. Reznor funded the subsequent North American tour out of his own pocket. Before the album's release, the song \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" provoked media speculation about whom Reznor had intended its acerbic lyrics to satirize. Cinesexuality critic Patricia MacCormack interprets the song as a \"scathing attack on the alternative music scene,\" particularly Reznor's former friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Marilyn Manson. The two artists put aside their differences when Manson appeared in the song's music video, retitled \"Starsuckers, Inc.\" and performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at Madison Square Garden in 2000. Reznor followed The Fragile with another remix album, Things Falling Apart, released in November 2000 to poor reviews, a few months after the 2000 Fragility tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as And All That Could Have Been. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc Still, containing stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music. During the Fragility 2.0 tour, Reznor suffered a heroin overdose in London in June 2000, forcing a gig which was to be played that night to be cancelled. The incident pushed Reznor into entering rehab, putting Nine Inch Nails on hold while he attempted to become sober. In 2002, Johnny Cash covered the Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" for his album, American IV: The Man Comes Around, to critical acclaim. After seeing the music video, which later won a Grammy, Reznor himself became a fan of the rendition: I pop the video in, and wow\u00a0... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps\u00a0... Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore\u00a0... It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning\u2014different, but every bit as pure. With Teeth A further six years elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth full-length album. With Teeth was released in May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. With Teeth debuted on top of the Billboard 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number one with an album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band's official MySpace page in advance of its release date. Critical reception of the album was mostly positive: Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield described the album as \"vintage Nine Inch Nails\". PopMatters condemned the album, claiming Reznor \"ran out of ideas.\" A music video for the song \"The Hand That Feeds\" premiered on the Nine Inch Nails official website in March 2005. Reznor released the source files for it in GarageBand format a month later, allowing fans to remix the song. He similarly released files for the album's second single \"Only\" in a wider range of formats, including Pro Tools and ACID Pro. David Fincher directed a video for \"Only\" with primarily computer-generated imagery. The planned music video for its third single, \"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\", was directed by Francis Lawrence but reportedly scrapped in the post-production stage. All three singles topped the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. Nine Inch Nails launched a North American arena tour in Autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Autolux and Death from Above 1979. Another opening act on the tour, hip-hop artist Saul Williams, performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. The Nine Inch Nails live band completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The Beside You in Time tour documentary was released in February 2007 via three formats: DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The home video release debuted at number one on both the Billboard Top Music Videos and Billboard Comprehensive Music Videos charts in the United States. Year Zero Nine Inch Nails' fifth studio album, Year Zero, was released on April 17, 2007, only two years after With Teeth, a marked change in the slow pace from the release of previous albums. With lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Year Zero is a concept album criticizing the United States government's policies and their impact on the world 15 years in the future. Critical response to the album was generally favorable, with an average rating of 76% on Metacritic. The story takes place in the United States in 2022, which has been termed \"Year 0\", by the government, being the year America was reborn. It had suffered several major terrorist attacks, apparently by Islamic fundamentalists, including attacks on Los Angeles and Seattle, and in response, the government seized absolute control of the country. The government is a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano. The government corporation Cedocore distributes the drug Parepin through the water supply, making Americans who drink water apathetic and carefree. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably Art is Resistance and Solutions Backwards Initiative.  In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authorities.  The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place. An alternate reality game emerged parallel to the Year Zero concept, expanding upon its storyline. Clues hidden on tour merchandise initially led fans to discover a network of fictitious, in-game websites that describe an \"Orwellian picture of the United States circa the year 2022\". Before Year Zero's release, unreleased songs from the album were found on USB drives hidden at Nine Inch Nails concert venues in Lisbon and Barcelona, as part of the alternate reality game. Fan participation in the alternate reality game caught the attention of media outlets such as USA Today and Billboard, who have cited fan-site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries. The album's first single, \"Survivalism\", and other tracks from Year Zero were released as multitrack audio files for fans to remix. A remix album titled Year Zero Remixed was later released, containing remixes from Year Zero by other artists.  The remix album was Nine Inch Nails' final release on a major record label for over five years, as the act had completed its contractual obligation to Interscope Records and did not renew its contract. The remix album was accompanied by an interactive remix site with multitrack downloads and the ability to post remixes. Reznor planned a film adaption of the album and noted Year Zero as \"part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist.\" The project moved into the television medium because of high costs for Year Zero as a film, then Reznor found American film producer Lawrence Bender and met with writers. On August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal: \"We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens.\" Since first announcing his plans for a television series, progress slowed, reportedly due to the 2007\u20132008 Writer's Guild strike, but it nevertheless continued.  the resultant miniseries, also named Year Zero, was in development with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions, with the screenplay and script written by Reznor and Carniv\u00e0le writer Daniel Knauf. Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip In February 2008, Reznor posted a news update on the Nine Inch Nails website entitled \"2 weeks\". On March 2, Ghosts I\u2013IV , a 36-track instrumental album, became available via the band's official website. Ghosts I\u2013IV was made available in a number of different formats and forms, ranging from a free download of the first volume, to a $300 Ultra-Deluxe limited edition package. All 2,500 copies of the $300 package sold out in three days.  The album is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike licence.  The album was created improvisationally over a 10-week period and contributors included Atticus Ross, Alan Moulder, Alessandro Cortini, Adrian Belew, and Brian Viglione. Similar to the announcement that ultimately led to the release of Ghosts I\u2013IV, a post on the band's website in April 2008 read \"2 weeks!\" On May 5, Nine Inch Nails released The Slip via its website without any advertisement or promotion. The album was made available for download free of charge with a message from Reznor, \"this one's on me,\" protected under the same Creative Commons licence as Ghosts, and has seen individual downloads surpassing 1.4\u00a0million.  The Slip has since been released on CD as a limited edition set of 250,000. Since the release of Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip, a 25-date tour titled Lights in the Sky, was announced in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, but it became a quartet with the addition of Ilan Rubin on drums. On January 7, 2009, Reznor uploaded unedited HD-quality footage from three shows as a download of over 400 GB via BitTorrent. In an immediate response, a fan organization known as This One Is On Us quickly downloaded the data and had begun to assemble the footage alongside its own video recordings to create a professional 3-part digital film, followed by a physical release created \"by fans for fans\". This tour documentary became collectively known as Another Version of the Truth and was released throughout late December 2009 to February 2010 via three formats: DVD, Blu-ray Disc and BitTorrent. To date, the group and the project has received significant attention from media outlets such as USA Today, Rolling Stone, Techdirt and Pitchfork TV, and holds the support of both Reznor and the fan community with theatrical screenings being held all over the world. Nine Inch Nails art director and webmaster Rob Sheridan noted on the band's official website: This is yet another example of a devoted fanbase and a policy of openness combining to fill in blanks left by old media barriers. The entire NIN camp is absolutely thrilled that treating our fans with respect and nurturing their creativity has led to such an overwhelming outpour of incredible content, and that we now have such a high quality souvenir from our most ambitious tour ever. Nine Inch Nails Revenge, an iPhone/iPod touch-exclusive rhythm game developed by Tapulous, was released on March 8, 2009 . This installment in the Tap Tap video game franchise was themed after Nine Inch Nails, and included tracks from Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip. Portions of the album Ghosts I-IV were also used in making of the soundtrack for the documentary Citizenfour. In February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on his official website, stating that \"I've been thinking for some time now it's time to make NIN disappear for a while.\" Reznor since clarified that he \"isn't done creating music under the moniker, but that Nine Inch Nails is done touring for the foreseeable future.\" The \"Wave Goodbye\" tour concluded on September 10, 2009, at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Reznor subsequently released two tracks under the Nine Inch Nails moniker: the theme song for the film Tetsuo: The Bullet Man, and a cover of U2's \"Zoo Station\", included in the Achtung Baby tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. In 2009 Reznor married Mariqueen Maandig, and formed a project with Maandig and Atticus Ross dubbed How to Destroy Angels. Its first release, a six-track self-titled EP, was made available for free download in June 2010. Reznor's next collaboration with Ross was co-writing and producing the official score for David Fincher's 2010 film, The Social Network. Reznor and Ross received two awards for the score, a 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture, and a 2010 Oscar for Best Original Score. Reznor and Ross again collaborated with Fincher for the official score the American adaptation of the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, released in December 2011, and then again on Fincher's 2014 film Gone Girl In July 2012 Reznor teamed up with video game developer Treyarch to compose the theme music for Call of Duty: Black Ops II. Later that year Reznor again worked with Atticus Ross along with Alessandro Cortini on a remix of the song \"Destroyer\" by Telepathe. Reznor also appeared in a documentary called \"Sound City\" directed by Dave Grohl, in addition to co-writing and performing the song \"Mantra\" with Grohl and Josh Homme. This led to further collaboration with Reznor and Homme on the 2013 album from Queens of the Stone Age titled ...Like Clockwork. Reznor contributed vocals and drum programing to the song \"Kalopsia\" and vocals on \"Fairweather Friends\" along with Elton John on piano and vocals. In October a project with Dr. Dre and Beats Electronics was announced that Reznor wrote was \"probably not what you're expecting [from me]\". The project was named \"Daisy\"; a digital music service was announced in January 2013. It was until January 2014 that the service was fully launched, with Reznor serving as chief creative officer. Hesitation Marks In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Reznor indicated that he would be writing for the majority of 2012 with Nine Inch Nails \"in mind\". Reznor eventually confirmed that he was working on new Nine Inch Nails material and might be performing live again. In February 2013, Reznor announced the return of Nine Inch Nails and revealed the Twenty Thirteen Tour. He also revealed that the new lineup of the band would include Eric Avery of Jane's Addiction, Adrian Belew of King Crimson, and Josh Eustis of Telefon Tel Aviv, as well as returning members Alessandro Cortini and Ilan Rubin. However, both Avery and Belew would quit the touring band before performances commenced, with former member Robin Finck returning in their place. By May 28 a new Nine Inch Nails album was complete. Released September 3, Hesitation Marks incorporated rhythms reminiscent of earlier releases, but was more expansive and theatrical. In addition to the recently departed Adrian Belew, Reznor employed bassist Pino Palladino along with  Todd Rundgren and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham to achieve various art-rock elements. The album produced three singles, all released prior to that of the album itself. \"Came Back Haunted\" was released on June 6, with an accompanying music video bearing an epileptic seizure warning. The second single, \"Copy of A\", was released on August 12 free of charge to US and UK Amazon.com account holders. \"Everything\" was the third and final single, recorded during sessions for the Nine Inch Nails greatest hits album. The sessions gave way to more songs that ended up yielding the entire album. In July the Twenty Thirteen Tour was underway, beginning with a slew of festival appearances that included the Fuji Rock Festival, and the Pukkelpop, Hockenheim, Germany's Rock'n'Heim and the Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The Tension 2013 North American leg of the tour ran from September to November and added Palladino, Lisa Fischer and Sharlotte Gibson to the lineup with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Explosions in the Sky as opening acts. This leg of the tour was documented and released in the spring as Nine Inch Nails Tension 2013. In 2014 the band extended its tour worldwide as a four-piece. The new lineup included previous collaborators, Ilan Rubin, Alessandro Cortini, and Robin Finck. The band was joined by Queens of the Stone Age for the Australia and New Zealand tour, during which a nightly coin toss determined who opened. The tour closed in Europe with supporting synth-pop act Cold Cave. After a month-long break, Nine Inch Nails again hit the road on a joint tour with Soundgarden. The 23-day journey extended throughout the continental US, with experimental hip-hop group Death Grips scheduled to open most of the shows. Two weeks into the tour, Death Grips announced its breakup and cancelled all subsequent live shows. Oneohtrix Point Never, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Cold Cave each replaced Death Grips separately for the remainder of the tour. In 2014, its first year of eligibility, Nine Inch Nails was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with 14 other candidates. While they were not inducted that year, the band placed second in the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees Fan Vote. In 2015, Nine Inch Nails was once again nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, they once again did not get inducted. In June 2015, Nine Inch Nails released instrumental versions of The Fragile and With Teeth to stream exclusively on Apple Music, a service of which Reznor is chief creative director. In an interview promoting the service, Reznor mentioned he has started \"messing around with some things\" in regards to a new Nine Inch Nails album, stating \"It's not a record I'm trying to finish in a month. It's more just feeling around in the dark and seeing what sounds interesting\". In December 2015, Reznor reported that \"Nine Inch Nails will return in 2016\". The Trilogy In October 2016, in response to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with \"2016 is not over yet\". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return by the end of the year: \"Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? ... Just wait and see what happens.\" Three days later, Reznor announced an EP titled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip to be released later in 2017, these plans however fell through. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band. In early 2017, the band announced three headlining festival dates in North America. In January 2017, the band announced that it would be performing at the Panorama Music Festival in New York on July 30. On March 21, the band announced on their official Facebook page that it would be headlining Day 3 of FYF Fest in Los Angeles on July 23. In the same post, the band also announced their 2017 touring lineup, which included Reznor and Ross joined by the band's 2014 touring lineup, Robin Finck, Alessandro Cortini, and Ilan Rubin. The band appeared in Part 8 of the third season of Twin Peaks, performing their song, \"She's Gone Away\". In June 2017, in an email that was issued out to customers waiting on delayed vinyl orders, Reznor confirmed that Not the Actual Events would actually make up the first part of a trilogy of EPs, with the second installment Add Violence being released on July 21 and the third and final EP of the trilogy to follow in 2018. The single \"Less Than\" was released a week prior to the second EP's release. Also in 2017, the pair were tasked to score the upcoming Ken Burns series The Vietnam War, and provide both original music and a compilation soundtrack of popular songs. Their score, which was released on September 15, 2017, included original compositions, and it also includes reworked pieces from other Nine Inch Nails songs and their award-winning scores for\u00a0The Social Network\u00a0and\u00a0The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The band released their ninth studio album, Bad Witch,<ref name=\"PF2\">{{cite tweet |author=Pitchfork |user=pitchfork |number=994589241354092544 |date=May 10, 2018 |title=Update: A representative for NIN has confirmed that Bad Witch is an album, not an EP http://p4k.in/zDVHilU  |link=https://twitter.com/pitchfork/status/994589241354092544 |access-date=May 10, 2018}}</ref> on June 22, 2018. The band also announced the \"Cold and Black and Infinite 2018 North America Tour\", where it toured with The Jesus and Mary Chain. To prevent ticket scalping, the band took the unusual step of only selling physical tickets that had to be purchased at the venue prior to the shows. Reznor stated of the decision \"The promise of a world made better by computers and online connectivity has failed us in many ways, particularly when it comes to ticketing. Everything about the process sucks and everyone loses except the reseller. We've decided to try something different that will also likely suck, but in a different way.\" Nine Inch Nails was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. In October 2019, Nine Inch Nails was again nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Ghosts V\u2013VI On January 15, 2020, Nine Inch Nails were officially named as members of the Class of 2020 for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the induction ceremony was postponed indefinitely.   Originally, only Trent Reznor was to be inducted as the sole full-time member of the group for most of its history.  After holding discussions with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Reznor announced that former live band members Chris Vrenna and Danny Lohner, as well as current members Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin , longtime guitarist Robin Finck, and the only other full time member of the band, Atticus Ross, would all be inducted as members of Nine Inch Nails. On March 26, 2020, Nine Inch Nails released Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts, their tenth and eleventh studio albums and the sequels to their 2008 instrumental album Ghosts I\u2013IV. The albums were released for free as a show of solidarity with the band's fans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the live induction ceremony for the 2020 Hall of Fame Induction was cancelled on July 15, 2020, and simultaneously, an induction special was announced to be broadcast and available for streaming through HBO and HBO Max, respectively, on November 7, 2020.  In the interim, a special display was created to represent Nine Inch Nails' presence in the Hall of Fame that celebrated their popular, muddy performance at Woodstock '94; opened on the 26th anniversary of the concert.  On November 6, 2020, Trent Reznor and the other to-be-inducted members of Nine Inch Nails were interviewed by journalist David Farrier about the history of the band and their feelings on being inducted.  Then on November 7, Nine Inch Nails was formally inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 2020, by punk icon Iggy Pop.  Reznor thanked the fans, his family, and all of his many Nine Inch Nails collaborators in his acceptance speech, recorded from his home in Beverly Hills, CA. On May 6, 2021, Nine Inch Nails released a new track, \"Isn't Everyone\" in collaboration with noise rock group HEALTH, who had previously been an opening act on their Lights In The Sky and Wave Goodbye tours. On May 7, they announced they would be playing two shows in Cleveland with the Pixies to commemorate their inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which, according to the band, would be \"the only NIN headline shows in 2021\". Those shows were cancelled on August 19, 2021, due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. Also in 2021, Reznor and Ross produced Halsey's album If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power. It was later nominated for the Best Alternative Music Album award at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. In February 2022, Nine Inch Nails announced a short tour of the United States for 2022, the group's first performances in nearly four years.", "hasanswer": false}]}

An eclipse forms part of the series' logo, and also occurs in the season one finale, \"How to Stop an Exploding Man\". As well, an image of the Earth eclipsing the Sun as viewed from an observation point away from the Earth, is used in the series' title sequence. When the total solar eclipse occurs in \"Genesis\", it is witnessed directly by Peter, Claire, Hiro, and Niki, as well as indirectly by Isaac. It is implied that the event is seen simultaneously in New York, Texas, Nevada, Japan, and California, although this is impossible in the real world, as the umbra is at most a few hundred miles wide. In fact, the Solar Eclipse that occurred on September 22, 2006 , was annular in Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana and partial in South America, West Africa, southern Africa, the Antarctic Peninsula, and East Antarctica. It was not total anywhere. Early in the episode, Micah is making a pinhole camera through which to witness the eclipse. The scenes involving Claire's excursion into the train wreck and Mr. Bennet getting into Mohinder's cab as Peter leaves were used again in Season 3's namesake Chapter Eight, \"Villains,\" showing the events that happened before or during the two scenes, explaining what caused the train to crash. Similarly, one of the last episodes of season 3 and volume 4, \"1961\", explains why Angela steals socks, something she did in this episode. The mural of the nuclear blast in New York becomes one of the show's major plotlines for the first season and volume. Throughout the first season, much of the plot revolves around the events the heroes face in trying to prevent the nuclear explosion from happening and ultimately succeed in How to Stop an Exploding Man.

{"id": "91_121", "question": "What genre is The Off Season?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_68157", "text": "The series has been praised by both television critics and historians for what was perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that copying and distributing copies or any portion of the program must also make the human-readable source code available under the same licensing terms. The second problem was that distributors might add restrictions, either to the license or by combining the software with other software that had other restrictions on distribution. The union of two sets of restrictions would apply to the combined work, thus adding unacceptable restrictions. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that modified versions, as a whole, had to be distributed under the terms in GPLv1. Therefore, software distributed under the terms of GPLv1 could be combined with software under more permissive terms, as this would not change the terms under which the whole could be distributed.

[...] Pulse is his strongest elucidation of this theme, treating the world wide web as a literal snare forging sinewy connections between strangers where the ultimate destination is chaos.\" The Guardian called it \"an incredibly creepy horror film\" that, in the same way as Ring, \"finds chills in the most dingy and mundane of locales; skillful deployment of grisly little moments and disturbing, cryptic imagery produce the requisite mood of dread and gloom.\" Film Threat wrote, \"What's worse than a horror film that frightens you sleepless is one that disturbs you to depression.\" The Washington Post commented, \"Pulse is best enjoyed if it's not questioned too closely. It lives visually in a way it cannot live intellectually\". Entertainment Weekly was critical of the film, writing \"Watching Pulse [...] you could almost die of anticipation\", commenting that \"nothing in the two snail-paced hours [...] makes close to a shred of sense\". The Seattle Times criticized the film's storyline and length, writing \"While it's rattling your nerves, Pulse leaves your brain wanting more\", and The Village Voice called the film \"at least half an hour too long\".

At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was \"unlawfully expelled from the partnership\" for what he called a \"personality clash\" with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: \"I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs\". McCarroll was replaced by Alan White, formerly of Starclub and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist Steve White and recommended to Noel by Paul Weller. White made his debut for the band at a Top of the Pops performance of \"Some Might Say\". Oasis began recording material for their second album in May of that year in Rockfield Studios near Monmouth. The band, by this point, had recorded the concert that would see release in August as Live by the Sea. During this period, the British press seized upon a supposed rivalry between Oasis and Britpop band Blur. Previously, Oasis did not associate themselves with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the BBC's Britpop Now programme introduced by Blur singer Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the \"Battle of Britpop\" that dominated the national news. Blur's \"Country House\" outsold Oasis' \"Roll with It\" 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week. Oasis' management came up with several reasons for this, claiming \"Country House\" sold more because it was less expensive and because there were two versions of \"Country House\" with different B-sides, forcing serious fans to buy two copies. An alternative explanation given at the time by Creation was that there were problems associated with the barcode on the \"Roll with It\" single case, which did not record all sales. Noel Gallagher told The Observer in September that he hoped members of Blur would \"catch AIDS and die\", which caused a media furore. He apologised in a formal letter to various publications. McGuigan briefly left the band in September 1995, citing nervous exhaustion. He was replaced by Scott McLeod, formerly of the Ya Ya's, who was featured on some of the tour dates as well as in the \"Wonderwall\" video before leaving abruptly while on tour in the US. McLeod contacted Noel Gallagher claiming he felt he had made the wrong decision. Gallagher replied: \"I think you have too. Good luck signing on\". To complete the tour, McGuigan was persuaded to return to the band. Although a softer sound initially led to mixed reviews, Oasis' second album, Morning Glory?, was a worldwide commercial success, selling over four million copies and becoming the fifth-best-selling album in UK chart history. By 2008, it had sold up to 22 million units in the world, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album spawned two further hit singles, \"Wonderwall\" and \"Don't Look Back in Anger\", which reached numbers two and one respectively. It also contained the non-UK single \"Champagne Supernova\", which featured guitar and backing vocals by Paul Weller and received critical acclaim. The song reached number one on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. In November 1995, Oasis played on back-to-back nights at Earls Court in London, the biggest ever indoor gigs in Europe at the time. On 27 and 28 April 1996, the group played their first headline outdoor concerts, at Maine Road football stadium, home of Manchester City F.C., of whom the Gallagher brothers have been fans since childhood. Highlights from the second night featured on the video ...There and Then, released later the same year . As their career reached its zenith, Oasis performed to 80,000 people over two nights at Balloch Country Park at Loch Lomond in Scotland on 3 and 4 August, before back-to-back concerts at Knebworth House on 10 and 11 August. The band sold out both shows within minutes. The audience of 125,000 people each night was a record-breaking number for an outdoor concert held in the UK and remains the largest demand for a show in British history. Oasis were due to record an episode of MTV Unplugged at the Royal Festival Hall but Liam pulled out, citing a sore throat. He watched the performance from a balcony with beer and cigarettes, heckling Noel's singing between songs.  Four days later the group left for a tour of American arenas but Liam refused to go; the band decided to continue the tour with Noel on vocals. Liam rejoined the tour on 30 August and on 4 September 1996, Oasis performed \"Champagne Supernova\" at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Liam made gestures at Noel during his guitar solo, then spat beer all over the stage before storming off. A few weeks later Noel flew home without the band, who followed on another flight.

Anderson initially resisted this approach as he wished to distance himself from the more commercial music that had largely defined Yes across the previous decade. Matters were complicated further as recording went on. Elias recalled a lack of solid material and the tension between Anderson and Howe especially, including the refusal of the two to stay in the studio while the other was present. Elias tried to help stimulate creativity and brought in a Hammond organ for Wakeman to play, but recalled Rick refusing as he thought the instrument was outdated. Elias concluded that ABWH \"didn't care about a note of music\", and was relieved to have finished some of the material at all, considering the difficulties and his personal dislike for some of the songs. In addition, Wakeman and Howe had both agreed to solo commitments prior to recording, so their respective keyboard and guitar tracks were stored onto a computer, but not finalised and mastered. In their absence, Elias and Anderson brought in session musicians to play new arrangements from the initial takes as they were dissatisfied with what Wakeman and Howe had played. Elias said, \"We weren't looking for only the early-'70s 'pyro technique'. We wanted something more modern\". Among the eleven additional keyboard and synthesiser players featured on Union is Jim Crichton of Saga. Crichton and his assistant Brian Foraker were given songs that needed work and the pair \"tried to fill in the gaps\" at Crichton's own studio by playing parts that they thought Wakeman might play under those circumstances. Crichton felt \"Dangerous \" was a particularly strong track in demo form, but that the final version on the album was substandard. Producer and record company dissatisfaction with some of Howe's guitar parts led to attempts to have them re-recorded by other musicians. Trevor Rabin was invited to do this, but turned down the opportunity. Recordings were made with session guitarist Scott van Zen, but ultimately the parts in question were replaced by Jimmy Haun who had worked in Squire's band The Chris Squire Experiment. Wakeman criticised Elias for allowing the edits and overdubs,  and the two addressed each other's issues in different publications of Keyboard magazine. Elias \"never questioned Rick's technical ability\" and stressed that Union was not an album of \"major opuses\" and felt Wakeman had \"lost his edge\". Elias ranked his time with Haun as his best experience during the making of the album. Howe called Haun an \"average guitarist\" and compared his changes to \"having an abortion\". Elias maintained the view that he and Anderson agreed that outside musicians were needed and described Howe's reaction as merely \"bruised ego from someone who is a very good guitar player in his own right.\" Howe included the original backing tracks of \"Dangerous \" and \"Without Hope You Cannot Start The Day\" on his 2017 compilation Anthology 2: Groups & Collaborations.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_129", "question": "What genre is Southern Rock Opera?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_36365", "text": "The idea for Southern Rock Opera pre-dates the band's formation in 1996. Southern Rock Opera began in a long discussion between Drive-By Truckers' frontman Patterson Hood and former Truckers bassist and producer Earl Hicks, during a road trip. The pair discussed writing a semi-autobiographical screenplay about growing up in the South and about the plane crash that almost ended the career of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, taking singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, and Gaines' back-up-singer sister Cassie Gaines. Soon after this discussion, Hood formed Drive-By Truckers. The Truckers recorded two studio albums and one live album during the four years between their formation and the actual recording of Southern Rock Opera. During these years, Drive-By's principal songwriters Hood, Mike Cooley, and Rob Malone continued to contribute songs to \"The Rock Opera\", as they had come to call it. After the release of their live album Alabama Ass Whuppin', Drive-By Truckers began recording what they hoped would be their magnum opus: Southern Rock Opera. According to Patterson Hood, \"was recorded in Birmingham, upstairs in a uniform shop during an early September heat wave, with no air-conditioning. We had to turn the fans off when we were recording, and we worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. So Southern Rock Opera was fun to write, but we had a miserable time making it.\" After the album was finished, however, the troubles continued for The Truckers when they ran out of funding for the immense project. To resolve the problem, and to avoid \"any fine print crap\", as Hood put it, the band took a non-traditional approach. The Truckers made a prospectus and solicited investors, with a promise of 15% interest, to pay for the manufacturing and distribution of Southern Rock Opera. The approach worked. Through their fan-based online news group and by sheer word of mouth, The Truckers were able to raise $23,000. This allowed them to print about 5,000 copies of the album, and buy a \"new\" used van for touring. Notably included in the group, dubbed \"The DBT Investors\", was Widespread Panic bassist and fellow Athenian Dave Schools. Southern Rock Opera was finally released on September 12, 2001 on Soul Dump Records.", "hasanswer": false}]}

From there they intend to drive to Vienna. A sick man in the back seat, who claims to be an Englishman called Flemyng, seems known to an aristocratic Englishwoman, Lady Ashmore, sitting in the front seat. The journey is difficult with diversions and roadblocks, some operated by Soviet troops and others by Hungarian insurgents. At a small lakeside town close to the Austrian border, the passengers are removed from the bus by Major Surov, the local Russian commander. After questioning them and impounding their passports, Surov orders they remain in the town's only hotel. He suspects the ailing Flemyng's passport is not genuine and develops a love interest in the attractive Lady Ashmore. It emerges that Flemyng is a Hungarian insurgent whom Lady Ashmore, his lover, is smuggling to safety. Surov deduces both facts but does not act, hoping that Lady Ashmore will offer herself to him in exchange for safe passage into Austria. Speaking good English, which Surov claims to have learned in Canada, he uses the trapped passengers as a sounding board for his views, arguing that Russians are human too and questioning the imposition of Marxism by military force. However, with Flemyng getting weaker from what is revealed as an untreated gunshot wound, Lady Ashmore bribes a fisherman to take the two of them to Austria, across the lake under cover of darkness. Surov deduces what is happening and captures them both. After getting Flemyng treatment by an army doctor, Surov sends Lady Ashmore back to the hotel. The other passengers are furious that Lady Ashmore jeopardised their release with her selfish behaviour. A pregnant American woman warns Lady Ashmore very frankly what she should do to save them all. Sniping by Hungarians has kept the Russian garrison on edge and a shot wounds Surov's beloved black horse. Unable to euthanise the horse himself, revealing a compassionate side to his nature, Surov orders a sergeant to kill the stricken animal. Lady Ashmore returns, dutifully, prompting Surov, in deep sorrow, to question if she returned willingly. When she truthfully says no, Surov releases Lady Ashmore. In the morning Surov orders the passengers to leave, minus the arrested Flemyng, driving to a quiet spot where they can walk into Austria. As the party crosses the border, Surov turns up with the weakened Flemyng, who he releases to Lady Ashmore. As Surov watches the two disappear, Hungarian bullets kill him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the mid-1970s he formed an avant-garde folk-rock group called Conventum with Ren\u00e9 Lussier, Jean Derome, Jean-Pierre Bouchard, Jacques Laurin, Bernard Cormier and poet Alain-Arthur Painchaud. Conventum was described by AllMusic as a mixture of  \"Quebec's folk roots with absurd poetry and progressive arrangements\". They released two albums, \u00c0 l'Aff\u00fbt d'un Complot in 1977 and Le Bureau Central des Utopies in 1979. In 1983 Duchesne, Lussier, Derome and Robert M.

Duchesne released his first solo album, Le Temps des Bombes on the new label in 1984. Then he began writing contrapuntal compositions for a guitar quartet, and formed Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar with Lussier, Bouchard and Roger Boudreault to perform the pieces. Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar was a concept band that Duchesne said was from post-apocalypse Canada \"inspired by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix\". They premiered at the 4th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville at Victoriaville, Quebec in October 1986, and continued until 1989, touring Canada, the United States and Europe. They also released two albums in 1987 and 1989. After the success of Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar, Duchesne returned to FIMAV in 1989 to premier \"his most ambitious work ever\", L' Ou 'L, a composition that explored different styles of chamber music. In 1991, he formed Locomotive with Claude Fradette and R\u00e9mi Leclerc, which also performed at FIMAV in 1991.

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature.

{"id": "91_144", "question": "What genre is SimTower?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_33652", "text": "SimTower was successful in Japan, earning the developers a profit. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun awarded Saito the \"Best Young Manager/Venture of the Year\" for his work on the game. After the initial Japanese release, Maxis president Jeff Braun contacted Saito regarding a worldwide release; SimCity creator Will Wright had informed Braun of the game. The company localized the game for sale in the United States, and changed the name to capitalize on the popularity of the Sim franchise and increase sales figures. Maxis published SimTower for the Windows and Macintosh System 7 operating systems in November 1994 in the United States. In 1996, it was ported to the Sega Saturn and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in Japan. The South China Morning Post praised the game's formula, noting that it followed in the footsteps of previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing SimTower to SimCity 2000, the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the \"homely\" feeling of SimTower, in contrast with other Sim games such as SimEarth and SimLife, which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly praised the game and commented that it is \"more fun than [the concept] sounds\". However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series. A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: \"There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, SimTower sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all.\" Australia's The Age found SimTower a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing SimFarm. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that SimTower had good replay value due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game four stars out of five. The game was criticized by the South China Morning Post for lacking documentation, making it more difficult to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time plays an important role in earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given. The Age was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of The Towering Infernos plot could have been included. Game Informer referred to SimTower as a \"lesser-known\" simulation game, and described it as \"fun and addictive\". Writing for the San Diego Union-Tribune, Matt Miller felt that, when compared to SimCity 2000 , gameplay in SimTower moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building. Dragon magazine's reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games. In 1995, the Software and Information Industry Association listed SimTower as the \"Best Simulation Program\" in the Consumer software category of their annual Codie awards.

{"id": "91_146", "question": "What genre is Dogs?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_15741", "text": "Roger Avary wrote the first element of what would become the Pulp Fiction screenplay in the fall of 1990: The initial inspiration was the three-part horror anthology film Black Sabbath , by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava. The Tarantino\u2013Avary project was provisionally titled \"Black Mask\", after the seminal hardboiled crime fiction magazine. Tarantino's script was produced as Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut; Avary's, titled \"Pandemonium Reigns\", formed the basis for the \"Gold Watch\" storyline of Pulp Fiction. With work on Reservoir Dogs completed, Tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film: \"I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story.\" Tarantino explains that the idea \"was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories\u00a0\u2013 the oldest stories in the book\u00a0... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'\u00a0\u2013 the oldest story about\u00a0... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times.\" \"I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry\", he says. \"Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel.\" In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: \"I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly [1955]. I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk\". Tarantino went to work on the script for Pulp Fiction in Amsterdam in March 1992, possibly at the Winston Hotel in the Red Light District. He was joined there by Avary, who contributed \"Pandemonium Reigns\" to the project and participated in its rewriting as well as the development of the new storylines that would link up with it. Two scenes originally written by Avary for the True Romance screenplay, exclusively credited to Tarantino, were incorporated into the opening of \"The Bonnie Situation\": the \"miraculous\" missed shots by the hidden gunman and the rear seat automobile killing. The notion of the crimeworld \"cleaner\" that became the heart of the episode was inspired by a short, Curdled, that Tarantino saw at a film festival. He cast the lead actress, Angela Jones, in Pulp Fiction and later backed the filmmakers' production of a feature-length version of Curdled. The script included a couple of made-up commercial brands that often featured in later Tarantino films: Big Kahuna burgers and Red Apple cigarettes. As he worked on the script, Tarantino also accompanied Reservoir Dogs around the European film festivals. Released in the United States in October 1992, the picture was a critical and commercial success. In January 1993, the Pulp Fiction script was complete.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Devis was the younger brother of the painter Thomas Anthony Devis and of the schoolmistress and grammarian Ellin Devis , teacher, among others, of author of Maria Edgeworth and Frances Burney . He followed his elder brother  Thomas Anthony in becoming a pupil at the Royal Academy Schools in 1774 and like his brother exhibited at the Free Society of Artists, of which in 1768 their father had become president, and at the Royal Academy. Early on he came to the notice of Sir Joshua Reynolds. He was appointed draughtsman on the British East India Company's packet Antelope in a voyage in 1783, under Captain Henry Wilson. In her he was injured in an encounter with Papuans near the Schouten Islands and was then wrecked on the Pelew Islands before proceeding to Canton and thence to Bengal. During his voyages, the artist received arrow wounds, one of which inflicted permanent injury on his lower jaw. During his time in Bengal, he painted a portrait of Sir William Jones, at the time a judge in Fort William. The painting now hangs at the British Library. He was back in London by 1795 and is recorded on 21 July 1797 as living at 27 George Street, Hanover Square, where he was insured by the Sun Assurance Office. He is noted for his involvement in the creation of the posthumous cult of Horatio Nelson. As she returned from Trafalgar, Devis went out to meet HMS Victory and was present on board the ship during the autopsy of Nelson's body conducted by Dr Beatty, the ship's surgeon. With the help of sketches he took at that time, he painted a heroic Death of Nelson, which proved a sensation. Devis also painted Dr Beatty, and was commissioned by him to produce a half-length painting of Nelson as vice-admiral, which he lent to Emma Hamilton . Either the original or a copy of this portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy two years after the Battle and many copies were made of it. Lord Howe owned one, and another ended up in the collection of the National Maritime Museum. It also appeared as an engraving in Beatty's published account of Nelson's death. Other work includes a portrait of King George III on horseback, and a range of portraits of admirals and generals, along with historical subjects, such as the Babington Plot and the signing of the Magna Carta. Better known is perhaps his Master Simpson , a portrait of a small boy, James Alexander Simpson, carrying a dog which has often been copied, imitated and exploited commercially. Despite some success in life, Devis seems often to have had financial difficulties, including imprisonment for debt. By the will of his brother Thomas Anthony Devis, who died in London in 1810, he inherited all Anthony's printed books and prints. Devis himself died in London, at Caroline Street, Bedford Square, of apoplexy in 1822 and was buried in St Giles' churchyard.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_148", "question": "What genre is A Milli?", "ctxs": [{"id": "422_3226", "text": "Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the world popular musical style and genre called merengue, a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the tambora and g\u00fcira. Its syncopated beats use Latin percussion, brass instruments, bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are Wilfrido Vargas, Johnny Ventura, singer-songwriter Los Hermanos Rosario, Juan Luis Guerra, Fernando Villalona, Eddy Herrera, Sergio Vargas, To\u00f1o Rosario, Milly Quezada, and Chich\u00ed Peralta. Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the East Coast, during the 1980s and 1990s, when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of bachata, along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other Latino groups in New York, New Jersey, and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity. Bachata, a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was amargue , until the rather ambiguous term bachata became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the pan-Latin American romantic style called bolero. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles. Palo is an Afro-Dominican sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the Congo region of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies. Salsa music has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like Johnny Pacheco, creator of the Fania All Stars, played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre. Dominican rock and Reggaeton are also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A moment later, Glory is there and captures a Lei-Ach demon, who tells her that Buffy is the Slayer. Glory sends it and its friends to kill her. Buffy decides to leave on-campus accommodation and move back to the Summers house to be closer to her ailing mother. The gang assists with packing boxes, and Willow reminds everyone about Tara's upcoming 20th birthday. Later at The Magic Box, Buffy and Xander struggle to come up with ideas for presents for Tara, coming to the realization that they do not really know her very well. They similarly struggle to find information on Glory, since Buffy's best description that she resembles Cordelia proves too vague to be of use. A young man comes into The Magic Box and disparages magic. He reveals himself as Tara's big brother, Donny, who has come to town with their father and cousin Beth for Tara's birthday. While Tara is clearly not thrilled at their presence, she agrees to have dinner with her family that evening. Tara returns to her room to find her father there. He expresses disappointment that she has not quit magic and berates her for being out of reach for months. He reminds her that all women in the family show their demon selves after their 20th birthday, which is why her family has come for her. After he leaves, Willow returns and wants to repeat the demon location spell that Tara had secretly sabotaged previously. Tara fakes fatigue, so Willow returns to the magic shop.

Fincher approached making Seven like a \"tiny genre movie, the kind of movie Friedkin might have made after The Exorcist.\" He worked with cinematographer Darius Khondji and adopted a simple approach to the camerawork, which was influenced by the television show COPS, \"how the camera is in the backseat peering over people's shoulder\". Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on-the-set rewrites. According to the director, \"Seven is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera\u00a0\u2013 and about what movies are or can be\". The crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film, as Fincher wanted to show a city that was \"dirty, violent, polluted, often depressing. Visually and stylistically, that's how we wanted to portray this world. Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible.\" To this end, Fincher turned to production designer Arthur Max to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants. \"We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it\", says Max. \"Everything is falling apart, and nothing is working properly.\" The film's brooding, dark look was achieved through a chemical process called bleach bypass, wherein the silver in the film stock was not completely removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality. The 'head in a box' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed. After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio, they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills' wife's head with that of a dog, or by not having Mills fire on John Doe.

However, Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work. Some interpreters of The Matrix mention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim \"that the [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries\". \"The influence of [Baudrillard] was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel\". In addition to Baudrillard, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans\u2019s ideas on evolutionary psychology. The film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series The Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as \"seemed to me my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen\". Comparisons have also been made between The Matrix and the books of Carlos Castaneda. The Matrix belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel Neuromancer by William Gibson. For example, the film's use of the term \"Matrix\" is adopted from Gibson's novel, though L. P. Davies had already used the term \"Matrix\" fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his 1969 novel The White Room . After watching The Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was \"exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis\" he had relied upon in his own writing; however, he noted that the film's Gnostic themes distinguished it from Neuromancer, and believed that The Matrix was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick, particularly Dick's speculative Exegesis. Other writers have also commented on the similarities between The Matrix and Dick's work; one example of such influence is a Philip K. Dick's 1977 conference, in which he stated: \"We are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Previously, the region as a whole was known as District of Augusta. The town was initially known as \"Potter's Town,\" as the  area had been purchased by Scott Walker and Dave Walkow on July 15, 1789. In December 1856, and additional  were taken from Middlesex . Early settlers of the time included Rowes Perry, Benjamin Brown, Jesse Brown and Joshua Brown, Elias Gilbert, Jabez French, Abraham Lane, Isaac Lane and Jacob Lane, Francis Briggs and Peleg Briggs, Jr., Edward Craft, Charles VanWormer born 1789 the oldest son of Orende & Jan VanWormer, David Southerland and John Griffin. Around 1805, Griffin and Riggs operated an ashery store and a distillery north of Nettle Valley, on what would eventually become the Erwin Wells farm in 1929. Riggs left, and in 1812, Griffin sold the operation to his brother-in-law, Richard M. Williams. Williams became an associate judge of Yates County; he largely concentrated on the manufacture of potash and whisky, and died on June 4, 1837. Williams' son, Richard H. Williams, was elected to the state senate in 1845, and served for two years before his term was cut short by the adoption of the 1846 constitution. Luke Conley also built a distillery in Nettle Valley some time after his arrival in Potter in 1805. Around 1810, he sold this building to Arnold Potter, and it was moved to Potter's Hollow, or Yatesville. For five years, he worked for Judge Potter in payment for  on lot four of the second range. Mr. Conley was also associated with William B. Rochester and aided in laying the foundation for the first mill in Rochester, New York. In Potter Center around 1790, there was at first a double log tavern, operated by one Bingham, believed to be Col. Luther Bingham, which was located just north of the hamlet on what is now Middle Rd. The tavern sat on the knoll on the east side of the road and just north of the Potter Center Schoolhouse #11. Mr. Bingham operated the tavern even before wagon roads were open. He was succeeded by Alben Darby who remained many years and died there. Many older documents refer to \"Darby's Corners,\" which was the intersection of what we now call Simmons, Mothersell and Middle Rd. to the north of Potter Center. In 1798, Lindsey Warfield established the \"Warfield Neighborhood\" which included, in part, land that would later become the township of Middlesex. Mr. Warfield's residence was on a farm previously owned by Benjamin Watkins.  His house was at the southeast corner of Ward Simmons and NY Route 247. The foundation of a house still remains there. His son, Lindsey D. Warfield, is listed in the 1876 Yates County Atlas at that site. The house burned some time in the middle 19th century. It was most likely to be the second house that burned. Other early settlers in the Warfield Neighborhood were a Mr. Wesson, William Foster, and Abraham Florence. Others were James Southerland, Jacob Voorhees, Peter Lamoreaux, Hendrick VanWormer & wife Saartje who in 1796 settled on the Darwin B. Holbrook farm, which is now owned by the Pendleton family. Hendricks younger brother Jan VanWormer settled in abt 1801. Dr. Frederic Dutch was a native of Germany. He came to Potter around 1800 and settled on  that eventually became the hamlet of Voak or The Dutch Settlement Dr. Dutch was a German Lutheran and helped to organize the German Lutheran Church at Voak. It is important to distinguish that it was not a \"Dutch settlement.\" It was a settlement of German Lutherans.  At that location there is mention of the \"German Meeting House\" in 1816, where a Christopher Bergstresser settled near. Other smaller settlements were Moontown and Hoardtown, which were basically the same location. These were not established villages. They were settlements highly populated by the Moon and Hoard family. It was basically the area of the intersections of Voorhees, West Swamp and Reynolds roads. There was a church on the north side of the intersection of Voorhees and West Swamp as early as 1810. The 1876 Yates County Atlas has it located on what now is the Artlip property. The school was originally located on the southeast corner. Later it was on the southwest corner. In 1802 Dr. Jareb Dyer purchased  that extended from the Willis Dyer Corners, west of the road, north beyond what would later become Potter Center. At that time there were no houses nearer than Warfield's Corners to the north and Aberham Lane to the south. Samuel Wyman settled in Nettle Valley in 1809 where Enoch Bordwell and George Green built a sawmill and a log house. Sanford Strobridge came to Potter in 1826 and at first settled one mile north of Potter Center. He was a wheelwright and a chair maker. In 1838 he resided in Potter Center and owned a gristmill known as the \"Gully Mill\" located at the southeast corner of Hagerty Rd. and Rt. 364. His son George would later operate the gristmill. The foundation of that mill can still be found. Arnold Potter, a son of Judge William Potter built the first sawmill in 1794 at Potter Center. Sanford had eleven children. Sanford D. Strobridge; Lyman H. Strobridge, who planted the first vineyard in Potter; Samuel G. Strobridge, who lived where the old Olsen Farm is; George W. Strobridge, who was a wagon maker; and William M. Strobridge, who was a soldier killed in the American Civil War. The carriage or wagon shop owned by George W. Strobridge was located at the point where West Swamp Rd. and Rt. 364 meet. The carriage shop was a three-story building that was later opened in 1928 as the Blodgett Bean House. Still later that same building was used as a feed mill outlet for a milling company based in Rushville. It was torn down in 1968. Directly behind his wagon shop was a blacksmith shop belonging to Eben and Thomas Finch in 1825 and later. It was also a three-story building with a planked incline on the north side. The Strobridge sawmill site at Hagerty Rd and the grist mill further down stream were driven by water from Mill Brook. When the mills were in operation, they made use of a dike west of Hagerty Rd. that must have also served as a bridge for that same road. The dike held the water back to the marsh in the gully towards Middlesex. Another early mill was the sawmill that was upstream from the current Tony Hiler residence. This saw mill, based on location, was likely converted from the early grist mill shown in early maps. It was said to have wooden gears and no metal. Some of the beams and siding of the mill were used by Tony Hiler to repair his house, and make the lean-to additions. According to a conversation between Carl Simmons and Tony Hiler, the Simmons, Hiler and George Clark house were built from the wood cut at this mill. The Hiler house was built in 1850. The old or main part of the Simmons home was built in 1831. This is believed to be the sawmill referred to in a 1913 newspaper as being operated by Culver, Barber and Barrett. As early as 1868 the assessment records show the mill belonging to Barber and Burnett. By 1874 it was registered as belonging to Oscar Burnett. At some point it was also used as a feed mill. In 1825, Milton Finch bought a lot from Henry Husted and established a public house, or tavern, and a blacksmith shop in Potter Center which he and his father, Ebenezer Finch ran. The tavern was located where the McDonald Hotel stood. It was first known as Finch's Tavern. Cleveland\u2019s book states that he was succeeded by Mark Weare, and Weare by Peleg Thomas. In 1879, the tavern burned and was later replaced by the McDonald Hotel. On the same night the store of John W. Durham and the George Fitzwater building also burned. About 1836, Cyrus Daines, James Stout and one Silvernail purchased land in Potter Center off Henry Husted and each established a business and a residence. These were the first buildings in Potter Center. Daines opened a blacksmith shop, Stout, a shoe shop and Silvernail, a tailor shop. The first store was kept by James Turner who was succeeded by Cyrus Daines who continued until his death in 1870. Richard H. Williams built a house and store, which was long occupied by Daines. The 1876 Atlas shows that Daines's store was on the east side of the road across from the hotel. The garage owned by Henry Eckert was in Cyrus Dains\u2019s old store, which burned in 1931. Peleg Thomas built a store on the west side of the road, which was later used as a Union Store. In 1836 in Potter Center there was a Methodist church, a Baptist church, two blacksmith shops, two wagon shops, one harness shop, other mechanics and one store. In 1928 James Blodgett opened a bean plant at the location of the old Aaron Gleason and Hobart carriage shop. The Aaron Gleason and Hobart carriage shop was the same building as the previous George Strobridge carriage shop. A Post Office was established in Potter Center around 1835. It was located in several places, usually at the store of whomever was appointed Postmaster. Richard M. Williams was the first postmaster. It was his work that established a route from Canandaigua through Rushville, Potter, Naples, Blood's Corners, Liberty, and Prattsburg.

{"id": "91_157", "question": "What genre is Point of View?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In December 1981 the group recorded five songs at New York's Radio City Music Hall. The material was released as the EP Sonic Youth which, while largely ignored, was sent to a few key members of the American music press, who gave it uniformly favorable reviews. The album featured a relatively conventional post-punk style, in contrast to their later releases. Edson then quit the group for an acting career and was replaced by Bob Bert. During their early days as part of the New York music scene, Sonic Youth formed a friendship with fellow New York noise rock band Swans. The bands shared a rehearsal space, and Sonic Youth embarked on its first tour in November 1982 supporting Swans. During a second tour with Swans the following month, tensions ran high and Moore constantly criticized Bert's drumming, which he felt was not \"in the pocket\". Bert was fired afterwards and replaced by Jim Sclavunos, who played drums on the band's first studio album, 1983's Confusion Is Sex, which featured a louder and more dissonant sound than their debut EP. Sonic Youth set up a tour of Europe for the summer of 1983. Sclavunos, however, quit the band after only a few months. The group asked Bert to rejoin, and he agreed on the condition that he would not be fired again after the tour's conclusion. Bert went on to play on the band's Kill Yr Idols EP later in 1983. Sonic Youth were well received in Europe, but the New York press largely ignored the local noise rock scene. Eventually, as the press began to take notice of the genre, Sonic Youth was grouped with bands like Big Black, the Butthole Surfers, and Pussy Galore under the \"pigfucker\" label by Village Voice editor Robert Christgau. Another critic from The Village Voice panned a substandard September concert in New York. Gordon wrote a scornful letter to the newspaper, criticizing it for not supporting its local music scene, to which Christgau responded that the paper was not obligated to support them. Moore retaliated by renaming the song \"Kill Yr Idols\" to \"I Killed Christgau with My Big Fucking Dick\", before the two eventually sorted out their differences amicably. During another tour of Europe in 1984, Sonic Youth's disastrous London debut actually resulted in rave reviews in Sounds and the NME. When they returned to New York they were so popular that they were able to book local gigs regularly. That same year, Moore and Gordon were married, and Sonic Youth released Bad Moon Rising, a self-described \"Americana\" album that served as a reaction to the state of the nation at the time. The album, recorded by Martin Bisi, was built around transitional pieces that Moore and Ranaldo had come up with in order to take up time onstage during tuning breaks; as a result, there are almost no gaps between the songs on the records. Bad Moon Rising featured an appearance by Lydia Lunch in \"Death Valley '69\", which was inspired by the Charles Manson Family murders. Due to a falling-out with Branca over disputed royalty payments from their Neutral releases, Sonic Youth signed with Homestead Records in the US and Blast First in the UK . While the New York press ignored Bad Moon Rising upon its release, now viewing the band as too arty and pretentious, Sonic Youth gained critical acclaim in the United Kingdom, where the new album sold 5,000 copies. Claiming he was bored with playing Bad Moon Rising live in its entirety for over a year, Bert quit the group and was replaced by Steve Shelley, formerly of the punk group The Crucifucks. Sonic Youth was so impressed with Shelley's drumming after seeing him play live that they hired him without an audition.

Although it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement, there is every reason to believe that Lully was in a hurry when writing this opera.  In effect, the opera reuses the interm\u00e8des from Moli\u00e8re's play.  Since these interm\u00e8des had met with such spectacular success seven years earlier, Lully must have felt that given his lack of time, he could at the very least attract a crowd with the promise of reviving the plainte italienne and the final divertissement.  All that was required was a synthesis of Moli\u00e8re's play that could coherently string together the already-existing interm\u00e8des.  Such a text would have to be one third the length of Moli\u00e8re's, that is to say 600 rather than 1800 lines long, and would have to be composed in varied rimes and rhythms rather than the alexandrines in riming couplets used in spoken declamation.  Unfortunately, Lully's usual librettist, Philippe Quinault, was in disgrace at court over his previous opera Isis and the task fell to Thomas Corneille, very likely at the bidding of the same cabal that had sought to disgrace Quinault.  Whether by choice or out of necessity, Corneille's text is not a synthesis of Moli\u00e8re's, but rather a profoundly different plot for a profoundly different genre.

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided to be happy with the results.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In recent times and to date Botswana has seen a remarkable appearance of distinguished writers whose genres range from historical, political and witty story writing. Prominent amongst these are the South African-born Bessie Head, who settled in Serowe; Andrew Sesinyi; Barolong Seboni ; Unity Dow, Galesiti Baruti; Caitlin Davies; Lauri Kubuetsile; Albert Malikongwa; Toro Mositi; and Moteane Melamu. Most of Bessie Head's important works are set in Serowe. When Rain Clouds Gather , Maru , and A Question of Power all have this setting. The three are also autobiographical; When Rain Clouds Gather is based on her experience living on a development farm, Maru incorporates her experience of being considered racially inferior, and A Question of Power draws on her understanding of what it was like to experience acute psychological distress. Head also published a number of short stories, including the collection The Collector of Treasures . She published a book on the history of Serowe, Serowe: Village of the Rainwind. Her last novel, A Bewitched Crossroad , is historical, set in 19th-century Botswana. She had also written a story of two prophets, one wealthy and one who lived poorly, called Jacob: The Faith-Healing Priest.

Nolan has denied that the film criticizes the Occupy movement, and insists that none of his Batman films are intended to be political: \"I've had as many conversations with people who have seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' \u2013 well, obviously, that's not true.\" Alternatively, politically-conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh alleged that the film was biased against 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney due to Bane's name being a homophone for Bain Capital, the financial service company Romney used to head, despite the fact that the character has existed as a major Batman foe since 1993. In response, Nolan said that the comments were \"bizarre\", while Dixon and Freeman said that the comments were \"ridiculous\". Democratic adviser Christopher Lehane has noted the similarities between the narratives of the film and the presidential campaign.

While PATH still connects to train stations in Hoboken and Newark, the Erie's Pavonia Terminal at what is now Newport and the PRR terminal at Exchange Place station have been closed and demolished. There were early negotiations for New York Penn Station to also be shared by the two railroads. In 1908, McAdoo proposed to build a branch of the H&M southward to the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal at Communipaw. When the rapid transit commissioners approved construction of the H&M's Sixth Avenue line in 1904, they left open the option of digging an east-west crosstown line. The New York and New Jersey Railroad Company received perpetual rights to dig under Christopher and Ninth Streets eastward to either Second Avenue or Astor Place. The project was started but soon abandoned; about  of the tube that was dug still exists. In February 1909 the H&M announced plans to extend its Uptown Tubes northeast to Grand Central Terminal, located at Park Avenue and 42nd Street. The openings of the 28th and 33rd Street stations were delayed because of planning for the Grand Central extension. The New York Times speculated that the downtown tunnels would see more passenger use than the uptown tunnels because they better served the city's financial district. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company , a competitor to the H&M, proposed to connect its Lexington Avenue line to the H&M at Grand Central, Astor Place, and Fulton Street\u2013Hudson Terminal once the planned system was complete. Its terminus at Grand Central was supposed to be located directly below the IRT's 42nd Street line but above the IRT's Steinway Tunnel to Queens. However, the IRT constructed an unauthorized ventilation shaft between its two levels in an effort to force the H&M to build its station very deeply, making it less accessible. As an alternative, it was proposed to connect the Uptown Tubes to the Steinway Tunnel. A franchise to extend the Uptown Tubes to Grand Central was awarded in June 1909. By 1914, the H&M had not yet started construction of the Grand Central extension, and requested a delay. Six years later, the H&M had submitted 17 applications for delays; in all of them, the railroad said it was not the best time for construction. The Rapid Transit Commissioners declined the last one, effectively ending the H&M's rights to a Grand Central extension. In September 1910, McAdoo proposed another expansion, consisting of a second north-south line through midtown. It would run  from Hudson Terminal to 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue, underneath Herald Square and near the H&M's existing 33rd Street station. The new line would run mainly under Broadway, with a small section of the line in the south under Church Street. Under McAdoo's plan, the city could take ownership of this line within 25 years of completion. That November, McAdoo also proposed that the two-track Broadway line be tied into the IRT's original subway line in Lower Manhattan. The Broadway line, going southbound, would merge with the local tracks of the IRT's Lexington Avenue line in the southbound direction at 10th Street. A spur off the Lexington Avenue line in Lower Manhattan, in the back of Trinity Church, would split eastward under Wall Street, cross the East River to Brooklyn, then head down Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, with another spur underneath Lafayette Avenue. McAdoo wanted not only to operate what was then called the \"Triborough System\", but also the chance to bid on the Fourth Avenue line in the future. The franchise for the Broadway line was ultimately awarded to the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company in 1913, as part of the Dual Contracts. In 1909, McAdoo considered extending the H&M in New Jersey, building a branch north to Montclair, in Essex County. A route extending north from Newark would continue straight to East Orange. From there, branches would split to South Orange in the south and Montclair in the north.", "hasanswer": false}]}

John becomes convinced that his family has a significant role in these incidents: his wife died in one of the earlier events, while Caleb was the one to receive Lucinda's message. Meanwhile, Caleb begins hearing the same whispering voices as Lucinda. To prevent the last event, John tracks down Lucinda's daughter Diana and her granddaughter Abby. After some initial disbelief, Diana goes with John to Lucinda's childhood home, where they find a copy of Matth\u00e4us Merian's engraving of Ezekiel's \"chariot vision\", in which a great sun is represented. They also discover that the final two digits of Lucinda's message are not numbers, but two reversed letter E's, matching the message left by Lucinda under her bed: \"Everyone Else\". During this search, Caleb and Abby, who were left asleep in the car, have an encounter with the beings who are the source of the whispers. Diana tells John that her mother had always told her the date she would die. He also visits Lucinda's teacher who tells him of the scratching on the door left by Lucinda. The next day, Abby colors in the sun on the engraving, which gives John a revelation. He rushes to the MIT observatory and learns that a massive solar flare with the potential to destroy all life will hit the Earth on the last date indicated by the message. As Diana and Abby prepare to take refuge in some nearby caves, John goes to the school and finds the door on which Lucinda engraved the final numbers, and identifies them as coordinates of a place where he believes that salvation from the solar flare may be found. The disbelieving and hysterical Diana loads both Caleb and Abby into her car and flees for the caves. At a gas station, the whispering beings steal her car with Caleb and Abby inside. Diana pursues them at speed but is killed in a traffic accident involving a semi-truck, on the date her mother predicted. The beings take Caleb and Abby to Lucinda's mobile home, where John encounters them shortly thereafter. The beings, who act as extraterrestrial angels, are leading children to safety on interstellar arks. John is told he cannot go with them because he never heard the whispering, so he convinces Caleb to leave with Abby, and two pet rabbits they found, and both are transported away by the beings. The following morning, John decides to be with his family when the flare strikes, and drives through a chaotic Boston to his parents' house, where he reconciles with his estranged father. The solar flare then strikes, destroying the Earth's atmosphere and all life on the planet. Meanwhile, the ark, along with others, deposits Caleb and Abby on another world resembling an earthly paradise, and departs. The two run through a field towards a large white mysterious tree .", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_195", "question": "What genre is MUD?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_7290", "text": "A MUD is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based or storyboarded.  MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language. Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by fictional races and monsters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers.  The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a fantasy world, complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by roleplaying, and advance the created character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling rules of the Dungeons & Dragons series of games. Such fantasy settings for MUDs are common, while many others have science fiction settings or are based on popular books, movies, animations, periods of history, worlds populated by anthropomorphic animals, and so on.  Not all MUDs are games; some are designed for educational purposes, while others are purely chat environments, and the flexible nature of many MUD servers leads to their occasional use in areas ranging from computer science research to geoinformatics to medical informatics to analytical chemistry.  MUDs have attracted the interest of academic scholars from many fields, including communications, sociology, law, and economics.  At one time, there was interest from the United States military in using them for teleconferencing. Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to play; some may accept donations or allow players to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed via standard telnet clients, or specialized MUD clients, which are designed to improve the user experience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector. The history of modern massively multiplayer online role-playing games like EverQuest and Ultima Online, and related virtual world genres such as the social virtual worlds exemplified by Second Life, can be traced directly back to the MUD genre.  Indeed, before the invention of the term MMORPG, games of this style were simply called graphical MUDs.  A number of influential MMORPG designers began as MUD developers and/or players or were involved with early MUDs .", "hasanswer": true}]}

This evolved into the John Entwistle Band, with Godfrey Townsend replacing Mark Hitt on guitar and joining harmony vocals. In 1996, the band went on the \"Left for Dead\" tour with Alan St. Jon joining on keyboards. After Entwistle toured with the Who for Quadrophenia in 1996\u201397, the John Entwistle Band set off on the \"Left for Dead \u2013 the Sequel\" tour in late 1998, now with Gordon Cotten on keyboards.

The album featured lost demos of Who drummer Keith Moon together with newly recorded parts by the band. In 1995, Entwistle also toured and recorded with Ringo Starr in one of the incarnations of Starr's All-Starr Band. This one also featured Billy Preston, Randy Bachman, and Mark Farner. In this ensemble, he played and sang \"Boris the Spider\" as his Who showpiece, along with \"My Wife\". Toward the end of his career he used a Status Graphite Buzzard Bass, which he had designed.

Entwistle also played at Woodstock '99, along with Mickey Hart, being the only performers there to have taken the stage at the original Woodstock. As a side project, he played the bass guitar in a country rock album project of original songs called the Pioneers, with Mickey Wynne on lead guitar, Ron Magness on rhythm guitar and keyboards, Roy Michaels, Andre Beeka on vocals, and John Delgado playing drums. The album was released on Voiceprint. Shortly before his death, Entwistle had agreed to play some US dates with the band including Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, following his final upcoming tour with the Who.

It was taken from the group's album Greatest Hits from the Beginning, but originally appeared on their abortive 1964 album, I Like It Like That. Written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson, Bobby Rogers, and Pete Moore, this song was a Billboard Top 40 Pop hit, peaking at number 35, and a Top 10 Billboard R&B hit, peaking at number nine. A showcase for poetic wordplay, the Miracles utilized several famous nursery rhymes in this song; in fact, the song's title itself is a variation of the rhyme \"What Are Little Girls/Little Boys Made Of?\" and parts of this famous rhyme were incorporated into the lyrics of this song, which, like many Miracles songs, starts with the guitar licks of Miracles member Marv Tarplin. Robinson, as the lead singer, serves as the song's narrator: While Tarplin plays and Robinson sings the lyrics, the other Miracles (Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, Pete Moore and Claudette Robinson, answer in classic call-and-response style. Billboard stated that the song has a \"good lyric line, great hand clappin' beat and mighty good on-frantic performance by the group.\"  Cash Box described it as \"an inviting shuffle thumper...that the artists serve up with a rhythmic delight.\" The Miracles performed this song before a live audience at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on the 1964 American International Pictures film, The T.A.M.I. Show. Present on stage were Robinson, Tarplin, Rogers, White and Moore. Although present on the original recording, Claudette Robinson, who was married to Smokey Robinson, was not present at the concert.  She had retired from onstage and TV performances earlier that year for family reasons, after touring caused her to have miscarriages, but she continued singing on their records as a non-touring member of the Miracles. The Miracles' \"That's What Love Is Made Of\" has inspired cover versions by Michael Jackson, Bobby Vee, Choker Campbell, and the Magicians, and has appeared on many Miracles \"Greatest Hits\" albums and CD Anthologies.  This Miracles song also inspired a cover version by Len Barry. The song's flip side was the popular regional Miracles hit tune, \"Would I Love You\", which was included on Greatest Hits from the Beginning, but did not appear on CD until 1996's Early Classics.

Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey. Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near G\u00e4vle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland. Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Ume\u00e5, Lule\u00e5 and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over  expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book . However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system. In  Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora. The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with  as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described  as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus's works. It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\" In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna.

One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

After the successes of the romantic Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and the historical epic Devdas \u2014one of the most expensive Hindi films ever made at the time\u2014he had made a plan to make another film in the romantic genre. Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\".

To find a gripping plot, Hitchcock turned towards the spy thriller genre, which was greatly in fashion since the early 1960s  with the success of the James Bond series starting in 1962 with Dr. No. Hitchcock had already found success in that genre many times, most recently in 1959 with North by Northwest. The idea behind Torn Curtain came from the defection of British diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean to the Soviet Union in 1951. Hitchcock was particularly intrigued about Maclean's life in the Soviet Union and about Melinda Marling, Maclean's wife, who followed her husband behind the Iron Curtain a year later with the couple's three children. With these facts as a starting point Hitchcock created a plot line involving an American nuclear physicist, Professor Michael Armstrong, defecting to East Germany. Against his will, the physicist is followed to East Berlin by his fianc\u00e9e and assistant, who decides to remain loyal to him regardless of his intentions.

It has been compared to similar sitcoms such as Lead Balloon and Curb Your Enthusiasm. David Belcher in The Herald commented on the show positively writing about the lack of a laughter track and the show's making fun of controversial subjects such as Christianity. However, people criticised Never Better for being too similar to other sitcoms and it received poor reviews overall. Paul Hoggart wrote in The Times that, \"It is amiably amusing, but may suffer from comparison with last year's Outnumbered, which covered similar ground with superb dexterity.\" One critic from the Daily Mirror said, \"Stephen Mangan's latest incarnation as recovering alcoholic Keith doesn't land with the same weight as Steve Coogan's Tommy Saxondale [from Saxondale] or Jack Dee's Rick Spleen [from Lead Balloon].\" A. A. Gill disliked the show, writing in The Sunday Times that, \"Never Better is so poor, so comically bereft, so rigorously scoured of charm, traction, humour or insight, that seeing that whichever sad sap wrote it couldn't be bothered to include an original syllable, neither can I. In America, the aspirational sitcom has, as is its nature, successfully progressed to become Friends and Sex and the City, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Frasier, The Larry Sanders Show. The recipe for success is simple: more of everything \u2013 more care, more commitment, more writers working harder to higher standards, with more discipline, for more money, with a collective understanding of what the genre stands for and, crucially, a belief that it has merit.\" Gerard O'Donovan in the Daily Telegraph also attacked the programme. After the second episode had been broadcast, he wrote that, \"Sadly, what modest potential the show evinced last week had evaporated in the interim. Recovering alcoholic Keith was again suffering from acute vagueness. Which was fine. But he also seemed to have lost his few remaining booze-free brain cells because he kept getting into scrapes as a result of not being able to use a mobile phone properly. If he'd been Victor Meldrew [from One Foot in the Grave], or a man of that generation, this might have been just about credible. But for an educated man in his thirties it was risible and came across as contrived beyond belief. A paper-thin character to begin with, with no job, no friends and no real personality to speak of, Keith was now entirely transparent, revealed as a mere vehicle for lazy situation comedy. Not even Mangan could rescue that.\" The series attracted poor ratings. The third episode, broadcast on 24 January 2008, received 900,000 viewers, the lowest of the five main terrestrial channels that day. The following two episodes broadcast on 31 January and 7 February received 800,000 viewers . The final episode had 823,000 viewers.

Robert Zemeckis had been involved with a film adaptation in the 1980s, while Sam Raimi's pitch was ignored. Universal allowed Raimi to develop an original treatment inspired by The Shadow in 1987 with the development of Darkman. David Koepp had listened to the radio serial of The Shadow as a child, when CBS re-ran it on Sunday nights. Koepp was hired in 1990 to write a new draft, and was able to find the right tone that the studio liked. Bregman remembers, 'Some of them were light, some of them were darker, and others were supposedly funnier \u2013 which they weren't. It just didn\u2019t work.' Koepp's script relied predominantly on the pulp novels while taking the overall tone from the radio show, with the actual plot originated by Koepp himself in consultation with Bregman. In an attempt to differentiate The Shadow from other superhero films of the time, Koepp 'focused on the copy line, 'Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?' and wondered how [the Shadow] knew what evil lurks in the hearts of men. And I decided that perhaps it was because he was uncomfortably familiar with the evil in his own heart.' For Koepp, the film then became 'a story of guilt and atonement'. He picked Shiwan Khan as the film\u2019s villain because 'he was bold and he knew what he was doing \u2013 he wanted to conquer the world. That was very simple, maybe a little ambitious, but he knew exactly what he wanted.' He had always been a fan of Alec Baldwin and wrote the script with him in mind: 'He has the eyes and the voice; he had so much of what I pictured Cranston being.' Koepp also sat in on rehearsals, and incorporated a lot of the actor\u2019s humor into the script. Stephen H. Burum served as cinematographer. The Shadow was shot on the Universal backlot in Hollywood on five sound-stages over sixty days with a five-day mini-unit tour of location shooting, and a week lost when an earthquake destroyed the Hall of Mirrors set. Mulcahy said, 'There are a lot of FX in this film, but it's not a FX film. It's a character/story-driven film. The FX are part of the story.'

They have been widely praised by critics for creating artistic statements with their music instead of aiming for mainstream success like many of their contemporaries did.

Soon after the band recorded an EP that was heralded by the Village Voice as one of the best records of the year. Early traces of Julian's prowess grace two sides of this historical platter. Later that year they were signed to Sire/Warner Brothers, and with the band and Richard Gottehrer producing came the Blank Generation LP. This album set a new standard for a whole generation of guitar players. Two of Julian's songs , \"Liars Beware\" and \"Betrayal Takes Two\" appear on side one. The reviewers gave the album high accolades and singled out the guitar work praising its merit. The album stands the test of time and today is still considered among the quintessential records of that period. The Outsets Julian formed The Outsets just after the breakup of Richard Hell and the Voidoids in 1980. He remembered seeing Vinny DeNunzio, of The Feelies, playing with Richard Lloyd's band and being impressed. As it turned out Vinny was ready for a change so they started holding auditions for bass and the other guitar. When the word got out, Fred Smith , Ted Niceley , and Tommy Keene were among those that came to play. Niceley and Keene had both played in Razz, a D.C. band whose members were friends with Julian. Eventually the positions were filled by Bob Albertson on bass and Simon Chardiet on guitar. Soon after the band went into rehearsals and prepared for live dates at CBGB's and Max's Kansas City. At this point there were more venues opening up such as the Mudd Club, Danceteria catering to a new minimal, percussive style of music and Ivan wanted to be part of it. The plan as always was to venture out with fresh ideas and to new places, so the first gig was booked at Tier 3, a performance space in Soho. After several months the band was signed to Contender Records and released their first single, \"I'm Searchin' For You\" b/w \"Fever\". Much has been made of the misprint on the label that incorrectly list the publishing rights for the B side. As a result, the record company corrected the mistake after the first pressing which has made it somewhat of a collectors item. The songs on The Punk/Funk Voodoo Collection were recorded in the basement studio of Giorgio Gomelsky, Yardbirds producer and early manager of the Rolling Stones. He persuaded Ivan Julian and the band to explore sounds outside of the boundaries of American pop music, most notably Fela Kuti. The music and the lyrics resound with the rough and tumble immediacy of East Village New York in the early 1980s. Included as Bonus Tracks are remastered versions of The Outsets first single originally released as a 45 on Contender records. Garland Jeffreys approached Ivan and offered to produce The Outsets forthcoming EP \"The Ice Man\", which also involved Bob Clearmountain as engineer. During this time he also recorded with Tomas Donker from Defunkt, Afrika Bambaataa and Bernie Worrell of Parliament/Funkadelic fame.

I admired the Francesco passages rather than feeling engrossed by them and occasionally it felt as if Smith's ideas were so clever they were in danger of getting in the way of the story. But there is no doubt that Smith is dazzling in her daring. The sheer inventive power of her new novel pulls you through, gasping, to the final page.\" Laura Miller, in The Guardian comments on duality of the novel: \"While I do not doubt the two halves of How to Be Both may be read in either order with satisfying results, once read, it's impossible to know what it would be like to first encounter it in the alternate order... How to Be Both is unforgettable. I can never know what it would be like to meet George before knowing Del Cossa, so that version of the novel is forever lost to me. It's a bit sad.

How to be Both shows us that the arrangement of a story, even when it's the same story, can change our understanding of it and define our emotional attachments. We may have known this, but to see it enacted with such imagination is dazzling indeed. Those writers making doomy predictions about the death of the novel should read Smith's re-imagined novel/s, and take note of the life it contains.\" Patrick Flanery of The Telegraph finds that \"The pain of mourning and loss is seared into the lives of Smith\u2019s two motherless heroines, but despite the novel\u2019s refusal of consolation and the profound seriousness of the questions it explores, How to be Both brims with palpable joy, not only at language, literature, and art\u2019s transformative power, but at the messy business of being human, of wanting to be more than one kind of person at once. The possibilities unleashed by the desire to be neither one thing nor the other means that one may ever and always strive to be both. With great subtlety and inventiveness, Smith continues to expand the boundaries of the novel\". Ron Charles of The Washington Post writes that \"This gender-blending, genre-blurring story, bounces across centuries, tossing off profound reflections on art and grief, without getting tangled in its own postmodern wires.

{"id": "91_217", "question": "What genre is Operator?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_47215", "text": "Glas is described as experimental and obscure. Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Despite finding Joanna unsympathetic, The Japan Times praised Knightley's ability to convey pain on screen. Filmmaker singled out Canet and Mendes for creating \"original beats in their roles as possible paramours\"; The Hollywood Reporter preferred their characters over Joanna and Michael. Mendes was praised as \"particularly appealing\" by Variety, and for \"resisting the urge to overdo her role the way a lesser actress would\" by DVD Talk. Some critics attributed Mendes' character and performance as her way of avoiding typecasting related to her appearance. On the other hand, Politico criticized Canet for appearing more \"creepy and presumptuous rather than romantic and sad\". Worthington received criticism for his performance. DVD Talk cited his \"dull and lifeless\" acting as the film's main problem, and Slant Magazine noted his \"idea of underplaying is to go blank\". Politico criticized both Worthington and Knightley for being too \"tepid\" and not realizing their roles' potential. Michael's storyline with Laura was poorly received, particularly in comparison to the scenes between Joanna and Alex. IndieWire did not believe Tadjedin established enough why Michael and Laura have sex beyond a shared physical attraction. Criticizing Worthington and Mendes as lacking chemistry, The Globe and Mail wrote that the pool scene was \"ridiculously prim\" and Laura was too \"tired and remote\" with Michael. Other critics said the film was too unbalanced, preferring Joanna over Michael. Den of Geek! wanted the story to be \"a little more even-handed towards Michael's character\", and The Boston Globe wished Tadjedin was more \"generous with the rest of the cast as she is with Knightley\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mack became friends while all three were working on individual small press projects. Bendis says that he also began to \"analyz[e] why it was that I [had] never attempted to write a superhero comic\" at the time, while he was writing crime books such as Jinx and Goldfish, despite his love of the genre. Concluding that Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen had sufficiently explored the genre, Bendis decided to work in other genres. The series' concept was derived from his love of crime fiction and police procedurals in general, as well as specific works such as Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, Janis Joplin's biography, Taxi Driver, T-Men, Traffic and Visions Of Light: The Art of Cinematography, and would take the form of a Behind the Music-type look at superheroes. Powers, Oeming says, is \"a superhero universe seen through the eyes of the police... [as] observed by the media\" and everyday individuals. Bendis' intention was to view the \"cliches of the superhero genre through the harder eyes of the cops\", but with the added layer that \"every arc has some footing in a famous rock star story\". Bendis' scripts are often compiled from \"a list of scenes\", eschewing \"the big exploding ending\" in favor of a \"character-driven or psychological ending\". Indeed, in experimenting with plots, the duo swiftly moved beyond 'mere' police procedurals , constantly pushing each other creatively in new ways. In conceiving plots for the series, Bendis emphasizes the purpose and themes in the narrative over \"just being cool\", and allowing the theme to dictate the direction of the story. Bendis would collaborate with Oeming, who had already expressed interest in producing a crime/noir comic with Bendis, inspired by his attempts to get work on Batman Adventures to do a book in a style reminiscent of Bruce Timm and Alex Toth. Bendis cites two images produced by Oeming as originating the then-experimental \"Powers' style\" and \"inspir[ing] everything in [Powers]\". Indeed, Bendis and Oeming's first collaboration was \"Mall Outing\" in Jinx: True Crime Confessions. It is included in Little Deaths \"for Powers completists and curiosity's sake\". Oeming has noted that, although seen as an overtly \"cartoony\" style, the artwork does not appeal to children, which helps sidestep the potential problem of the book, which contains mature content, being purchased by customers younger than its intended audience. Despite both creators only having produced work in black and white before Powers, Bendis envisioned Powers in color, and convinced Oeming that it could work, despite the dramatically higher number of sales required to sustain a color comic. Bendis also convinced Oeming that the book should juxtapose both the superhero and crime noir genres, as Oeming initially shied away from the former. Bendis writes in the 'Sketchbook' section of the Powers: Who Killed Retro Girl? TPB that \"one of the rules of film noir is that the city itself should be considered a lead character\". To this end, he made Oeming watch Visions of Light, a documentary by the American Cinematographers Institute about the art of lighting in film, which he saw as important to the feel of comics also. According to Oeming, both he and Bendis do copious research for their projects, and that before he began the series, he would do ride-alongs with police, meet police officials, and take extensive photo reference of their equipment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 100% based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Neon Genesis Evangelion, both a cultural touchstone for Japan and an uncompromising auteurist vision by creator Hideaki Anno, doubles as an enthralling apex for the mecha anime genre and as a harrowing exploration of depression \u2013 making for a wholly singular epic about angels and inner demons.\" The \"richness\" of the characters and \"complex and layered\" narrative has received praise by critics. In 1998, Max Autohead of Hyper rated it 10 out of 10, praising the \"brilliant and fantastic storyline, with amazing characters who pull you not only into their world, but into their psyche as well. The same year, Shidoshi of GameFan magazine gave it an A rating, calling it an \"awesome\" series. Mike Hale of The New York Times described it in 2009 as \"a superior anime, a giant-robot tale of unusual depth, feeling and detail.\" Following the conclusion of the series' original television broadcast, the public and critical reception to Neon Genesis Evangelion was polarized, particularly with regard to the final two episodes. The experimental style of the finale confused or alienated many fans and spawned debate and controversy; the criticism was largely directed toward the lack of storyline resolution in the final two episodes. Opinion on the finale was mixed, with the audience broadly divided between those who considered the episodes \"deep\", and those who felt their meaning was \"more apparent than real\". The English voice actors admitted that they also had trouble understanding the series' conclusion. The Mainichi Times wrote that after episode 25, \"nearly all viewers felt betrayed\u00a0... When commentator Eiji \u014ctsuka sent a letter to the Yomiuri Shimbun, complaining about the end of the Evangelion series, the debate went nationwide.\" Despite the criticism, Anno stood by his artistic choices for the series' conclusion. Critic Zac Bertschy remarked in 2003 that \"Most of the backlash against Evangelion existed because people don't like to think\". The initial controversy surrounding the end of Evangelion has had no lasting negative influence on the popularity of the series. Evangelion has developed into a social phenomenon beyond its primary fan base, generating national discussion in Japan. The series has also been the subject of numerous media reports, debates, and research studies worldwide. Evangelion has received review by critics, academics and sociologists alike, including by Susan J. Napier, William Rout, Mick Broderick, Mari Kotani, Shinji Miyadai, Hiroki Azuma, Yuriko Furuhata, and Marc Steinberg. The series has been described as both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre. Theron Martin described the character design as \"distinctive, designed to be sexy rather than cutesy\", and the mecha designs as \"among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series, with sleek, lithe appearances that look monstrous, fearsome, and nimble rather than boxy and knight-like\". Mike Crandol stated \"It no longer seems contrite to say that Evangelion is surely one of the all-time great works of animation\".

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

After the successes of the romantic Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and the historical epic Devdas \u2014one of the most expensive Hindi films ever made at the time\u2014he had made a plan to make another film in the romantic genre. Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\".

The members of the band consisted of Janice-Marie Johnson , Carlita Dorhan , Perry Kibble and Donald Ray Johnson . Longtime friends Kibble and Janice-Marie Johnson were the original members of the band. Each had left a band to join forces, and after employing several drummers, they settled on Donald Johnson . Gregory Walker also replaced the lead singer , who had left the band just prior to the successful release of \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\". Carlita Dorhan left the group in early 1976, and Hazel Payne was added. The group began to improve its sound over a period of six years prior to being discovered by Capitol Records.  Hitting major cities outside of Los Angeles, they also began doing USO tours, with spots in Spain, Morocco, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, and Japan. Upon returning to Los Angeles, while playing in a nightclub, they were spotted by record producers, Fonce and Larry Mizell, who convinced Capitol Records' then vice-executive-producer, Larkin Arnold, to give them an audition. They signed a five-album contract, and billed themselves after Herb Alpert's song, \"A Taste of Honey\". The first single, \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\", from their debut album A Taste of Honey, spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978, and sold two million copies. The group was awarded two platinum records for the single and album, and won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 20th Grammys on February 15, 1979. Janice\u2013Marie Johnson calls the single her \"lifeline\" and credits Capitol Records executive, Larkin Arnold, with ensuring they owned their own publishing. Their subsequent disco releases, such as \"Do It Good\" from Another Taste, and \"Rescue Me\" failed to attract attention, and by 1980 the group had become a duo consisting of Johnson and Payne. When recording their cover version of the Kyu Sakamoto song \"Sukiyaki\", from their third album, Twice as Sweet , they resisted suggestions to turn it into a dance tune. As a ballad it brought them their second and final major hit of their careers in 1981, when it reached number one on the Billboard R&B and Adult Contemporary charts and number 3 on the Hot 100. A Taste of Honey released their fourth and final album, Ladies of the Eighties in 1982. It featured their final Billboard Hot 100 single, \"I'll Try Something New\" . This cover of the Smokey Robinson and the Miracles hit from 1962 also went to number 9 on the R&B charts and number 29 on the Adult Contemporary. While preparing to record their fifth album in 1983, Payne left the group and Janice-Marie Johnson went on to record as a solo artist to fulfill contractual obligations, releasing One Taste of Honey, which produced the single \"Love Me Tonight\", a minor hit on the R&B chart. Payne went on to become an international stage actress, appearing in a number of theatre plays around the world including Oh! What A Night. Upon moving to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in the early 1990s to play in local night clubs and to write music for a television production, Kibble married a local music teacher, Anne-Marie LaMonde, in 1993, and become stepfather to her three children, Natalie, Marci and Gregory Pilkington. Kibble died in February 1999 of heart failure, at the age of 49. Donald Ray Johnson continues to live and play blues in Calgary, where he also married a local. Johnson released several blues albums under his own name. The following year, Janice-Marie Johnson released her second solo album, Hiatus of the Heart.  In 2004, Payne and Janice-Marie Johnson reunited for the first time in over twenty years to perform on the PBS specials Get Down Tonight: The Disco Explosion and My Music: Funky Soul Superstars.

The main topic of these novels is the deep friendship of a fictional Mescalero Apache chief and his German companion and blood-brother, , who are both exemplary virtuous and stand together to keep the peace between Indians and immigrating White settlers. Der Schuh des Manitu spoofs the friendship motif in the Winnetou novels and in their 1960s film adaptations which has largely led to high, but sometimes idealised and clich\u00e9 ridden admiration of Native Americans in Germany.  Many shots of the original Winnetou movies feature Old Shatterhand and Winnetou riding side by side, accompanied by romantic orchestral music . Winnetou's main objection against European settlers is their \"greed\".  He dislikes that they want to take all the land for themselves and cannot share with the natives.  A recurring opponent is the bandit Santer who kills Winnetou's father and sister, probably the namesake of Santa Maria in the parody. There is also a movie called Winnetou und das Halbblut Apanatschi based not on a May novel but using his characters - the name of the movie's main character Abahachi is probably based on this. So is the name of Uschi, Abahachis's old love, hinting to the name of actress Uschi Glas who used to play Apanatschi.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_236", "question": "What genre is Project A?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_75566", "text": "The novel Drive by James Sallis was published in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was \"the kind of character you rarely see anymore  he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it\". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \"a very tricky structure\" for a feature film. A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as \"an L.A.-set action mystery\", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board. By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project. Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: \"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me  writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \"very strong character\" at its core, and a \"powerful\" romance. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said: I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft  maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. The actor chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, whose work he admired. He said, \"It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.\" When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The variety offered by the champion roster was described by Steven Strom of PC Gamer as \"fascinating\"; Jackson pointed to \"memorable\" characters and abilities.

Two years before Strom's review, a champion designer responded to criticism by players that a young, female champion was not conventionally attractive. He argued that limiting female champions to one body type was constraining, and said progress had been made in Riot's recent releases. Comparisons persisted between the game and others in the genre.

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream.

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Anime News Network's Theron Martin noted that \"the content follows through well enough that this is looking like a largely satisfying follow-up to the original\" for a final score of 3 out of 5.

After graduating high school, Bell headed to college where he met drummer Jody Abbott. Bell and Abbott formed a college campus band, Wanted , in Henderson, Tennessee. The band Wanted transitioned into Phoenix, which was a touring band for the college primarily used to recruit prospective students. After college, Bell and Abercrombie, who at the time was attending college at the University of Tennessee at Martin, reunited with Abbott and formed the band Reel Too Real, playing cover songs at local clubs in Tennessee and eventually becoming a national touring club circuit band. Bassist Jeff Abercrombie saw vocalist-guitarist Brett Scallions performing in a bar in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1992 and later recruited him to join in early 1993. Keyboardist Erik Avakian joined the group in 1995. During this time, Carl played guitar and provided backing vocals, Jeff played bass, Jody was on drums, Brett played guitar and sang lead vocals, and Erik played keyboards and shared singing duties on various songs. That same year, the band moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they performed at local Pennsylvania bars & nightclubs under the name Reel Too Real, playing cover songs. The band made a choice to perform under a different name when showcasing its own original material. That name, for the time being, would be Small the Joy, which produced one self-released EP, a self-titled cassette tape, in 1994. The band then once again decided to change its name, this time settling on the name Fuel, before self-releasing their second EP, Porcelain, in 1996 as well as repackaging their first EP, Small the Joy, with the \"Fuel\" name on it. There were several names on a shortlist, but in the end, Fuel was the name everyone agreed on. Erik played keyboards and sang backing vocals on both EPs before leaving the band in 1996. Porcelain sold well locally, spawning a small local radio hit with \"Shimmer\" even before being signed to a major label. The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their third EP, Hazleton, the following year, 1998. Mainstream success Upon signing to Epic, the band entered Longview Farm recording studios in Massachusetts, along with producer Steven Haigler and session drummer Jonathan Mover due to problems with Abbott. The band's full-length debut, Sunburn, came out in 1998. \"Shimmer\" was again included and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts, No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, No. 37 on the Adult Top 40 chart and at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the other singles received some airplay. The songs \"Shimmer\" and \"Sunburn\" are also featured on the charitable album Live in the X Lounge. \"Sunburn\" was also featured in the movie Scream 3, and the band contributed the non-LP track \"Walk the Sky\" to the 1998 American Godzilla film. The band hit the road in support of the release. Once again due to problems with Abbott, Mover was enlisted, this time to play drums on tour while the band sought out a full-time drummer to join. Kevin Miller joined the band as the drummer, coming from the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania-based bar band The Armadillos. Liner notes for the cassette and CD issues of \"Sunburn\" list the band members as Carl Bell , Brett Scallions , Jeff Abercrombie , and Kevin Miller , although Jonathan Mover is credited with playing all the drums and percussion on the record. The band picture includes Miller, though he did not play on the record. The album Sunburn was the band's first Gold and Platinum selling record. In 2000, Fuel returned with their second album, Something Like Human, featuring the single \"Hemorrhage \" which was No. 1 for 12 weeks on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single was also named Billboards No. 5 Rock Song of the Decade according to their Best of the 2000s Rock Songs chart. In 2013 \"Hemorrhage \" became the No. 6 Alternative Rock song of the past 25 years according to Billboards Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs. Something Like Human peaked at No.\u00a017 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA on September 25, 2001. The group's third album, Natural Selection, named after Darwinian theory, was released in September 2003 and debuted at No. 15 on the U.S. Billboard charts. The extended lag time between Something Like Human and Natural Selection was due to legal problems and lead singer Scallions having to recover from surgery to repair a deviated septum he suffered from an on-stage collision with Bell. The album spawned the hit \"Falls on Me\", which hit No. 9 and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and the Modern Rock Tracks charts, and reaching No. 13 and No. 17 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, peaking at No.\u00a052 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004 for best engineered album, and the band contributed the song \"Won't Back Down\" to the Daredevil soundtrack earlier in the year. They released their greatest hits album The Best of Fuel on December 13, 2005. Their song \"Quarter\" was featured in the games Need for Speed: Underground, NFL Street, and NASCAR Thunder 2004. Line-up changes and Angels & Devils After disagreements , drummer Kevin Miller was dismissed from the band in 2004. On February 7, 2006, Fuel announced through their website singer Brett Scallions had left the band. Fuel had already laid the instrumental tracks for their fourth album and soon began auditioning singers so the band could move forward. Abercrombie and Bell took notice of American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry, after he performed \"Hemorrhage \" on the show. The single achieved the iTunes Top 10 download list, remaining a number of days and sparking interest in other Fuel songs, which began to appear in the iTunes Top 100 download chart. On March 3, 2006, American Idol judge, Randy Jackson, stated in an interview Daughtry had been offered the opportunity to become Fuel's new lead singer. Fuel confirmed their interest on their official website as well as interviews appearing on CNN Entertainment Tonight. On May 11, 2006, Abercrombie and Bell appeared on the TV show Extra to officially offer Daughtry the job. However, though flattered, Daughtry turned down this offer. By this time also, Tommy Stewart, formerly of Godsmack, was named on Fuel's Myspace page as Fuel's drummer. On June 8, 2006, Bell announced the band had found a new lead singer but was awaiting confirmation from the record label to announce it. Still, they officially entered the studio in mid-August with producer Scott Humphrey to start recording their fourth album. Due to other commitments Stewart was not available to play drums on the album, so Tommy Lee and Josh Freese performed drums in his place. The band posted photos from the studio fairly often on the band's website and MySpace. On March 9, 2007, Carl Bell officially announced Fuel's next album, complete with new band members, was fully mixed and going to mastering, and on April 19, 2007, he posted on Fuel's official website their new lead singer was Toryn Green.

Angels & Devils debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 42, selling roughly 15,000 copies in its first week. On October 20, 2008, Sony's catalog division Legacy Recordings released the album Playlist: The Very Best of Fuel on their Playlist series. The return of Brett Scallions and Puppet Strings On April 8, 2010, the reformation of Fuel was confirmed in an official press release. The band consisted of Scallions with an entirely new lineup. \"There is only one original of anything,\" says Scallions, \"and that includes Fuel. The original lineup with Carl, Jeff, Jody, and myself will always be something special to all of us, and our first Fuelies but it has been thirteen years since the original lineup was intact, and since then many great musicians have come and gone. The lineup I put together for Fuel is not meant to replace or diminish what any of the original members created. Just the opposite, it is to give our fans a live destination and to keep the Fuel name alive for a new generation to discover. Maybe someday we'll all get on the same page and play together again, but life happens, and the next thing you know you just can't jump on a bus and take off for a month, let alone a year.\" It was later announced on June 25, 2010, former Shinedown guitarist Jasin Todd had joined the band to replace Yogi Lonich on lead guitar. Lonich returned to the band in January 2011. Todd left the band on good terms. In March 2011, Brett Scallions started a new band called World Fire Brigade. The group was a writing team of Brett Scallions, Eddie Wohl, and Smile Empty Soul's Sean Danielsen. Scallions and Danielsen shared vocal duties, Danielsen played guitar parts, Scallions played bass, and Ken Schalk performed all drum tracks. Guest guitar solos were contributed by Rob Caggiano of Volbeat, Andy Andersson who played with Scallions in Fuel during the Puppet Strings era, and Mike McCready of Pearl Jam. The re-formed Fuel performed at The Bamboozle in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on May 1, 2011. The band played Bethlehem Musikfest alongside Buckcherry, however, Yogi Lonich was not on stage. A friend of Scallions, Martin Estrada, filled in for the show. Brett Scallions announced on his official Facebook page that Yogi Lonich and Scallions were parting ways amicably and it was best for Fuel to search for a replacement. Scallions also hinted there to be new music in the works and also introduced the band's new lead guitarist, Andy Andersson. The band continued its tour and played new material during their shows. Fuel entered the studio on March 8, 2012, to record their fifth full-length studio album, Puppet Strings. Eddie Wohl, co-producer of the World Fire Brigade album alongside Scallions and Danielsen, co-produced the new Fuel album with Scallions. In late September, the band re-entered the studio to complete the guitar and bass tracks for the record. As of February 2013, the band was still in the studio finishing vocal & guitar tracks. Originally planned for a 2012 release, the album had been pushed back to a possible mid-2013 release. This marked six years since the band released their previous album Angels & Devils. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the Billboard Rock charts, marking the band's first number one since Something Like Human. On April 30, 2013, drummer Ken Schalk announced his departure from the band to spend more time with his family. On that same day, Scallions announced new drummer Bryan \"Keelgood\" Keeling. The band, however, kept Schalk's drum tracks, as referenced by Keeling in his first interview since joining the band. On April 30, 2013, Brett Scallions announced a new Fuel single was targeted for a mid-summer release via download once the \"details have been worked out and handshakes have been made\". On June 26, 2013, Scallions announced that Bryan Keeling was going out on tour with Eric Sardinas in Europe and that Shannon Boone had joined the band. Scallions also commented on the new album; \"The record has been recorded and is so close to being released for all of you I can taste it. There will be big announcements very soon regarding release dates, singles, videos, and much much more. Take care and we will see you all soon at a venue near you!\" Scallions confirmed the new album was mixed by Ben Grosse who also collaborated with Fuel on Something Like Human. According to Scallions, the new album was currently in the mastering stage of production. It was announced through Guitar World on December 5, 2013, the album indeed titled, Puppet Strings, would be released on March 4, 2014. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the rock charts, the band's first number one since Something Like Human. The song, \"Yeah!\", was released for free download on the website as well, although it was believed to be the first single, Scallions stated it is not the first single but rather a \"teaser\". The first single, \"Soul to Preach To\" was released in late January 2014. In May 2015, as Fuel geared up to join Everclear on their Summerland Tour, ex-Filter bass player Phil Buckman temporarily replaced Brad Stewart, with Stewart himself filling in for the band Saliva. Although Brad stated he was scheduled to re-join Fuel on June 9, the temporary switch proved to be permanent with Stewart continuing his new role in Saliva, as did Buckman with Fuel. Scallions made many posts on Facebook and Instagram of him working in the studio on new material. It was later announced it was to be released as solo material. The band toured the US in August and September 2017 and toured Australia and New Zealand in December 2017. Fuel toured throughout 2018, playing Sunburn in its entirety to commemorate its 20th anniversary. On October 21, 2020, Scallions officially announced his departure from Fuel in a Facebook post : Bell's return and new record Anomaly Sometime in 2020, founding member and primary songwriter Carl Bell decided to return to the band, forming a new version of group. According to Bell, this was more or less a rebirth of Fuel and a new era for the band. Bell reunited with former drummer Kevin Miller to reform the group. Together they recruited a new singer, John Corsale, who at the time was the frontman for Miller's band Smashed. They began rehearsing in summer of 2020, and later began working on what would become Fuel's 6th full-length album. During that time, the band also released Something Like Human on vinyl for the first time. Fuel's newest album, Anomaly, was released on October 22, 2021.  Basically due to travel restrictions from Covid and the inability for the band to get together, Bell wrote all the songs on Anomaly, performed all the instruments on the album, recorded, arranged, produced and mixed the album.  The first single, \"Hard\", was released on July 9. The album's second single, \"Don't Say I\", was released on August 20, 2021. The album's 11 songs were written and performed by Bell with vocals by Corsale. Miller, along with new members Mark Klotz and Tommy Nat do not perform on the album but are featured in the videos and live performances. The cover art and track listing was revealed on August 28. Since the album's release, the band has been performing various shows live in the US, and has more shows and some major festival dates scheduled for 2022.  Scheduled 2022 festivals include dates with KISS, Five Finger Death Punch, Papa Roach, Seether, Bush, Puddle of Mud, Mammoth WVH, Bad Wolves and many others.  The band is also scheduled to release new material in addition to the Anomaly release.", "hasanswer": false}]}

There are also numerous smaller reliquaries throughout the world. Andrew's remains were preserved at Patras. According to one legend, Saint Regulus , a monk at Patras, was advised in a dream to hide some of the bones. Shortly thereafter, most of the relics were transferred from Patras to Constantinople by order of the Roman emperor Constantius II around 357 and deposited in the Church of the Holy Apostles. Regulus was said to have had a second dream in which an angel advised him to take the hidden relics \"to the ends of the earth\" for protection. Wherever he was shipwrecked, he was to build a shrine for them. St. Rule set sail, taking with him a kneecap, an upper arm bone, three fingers and a tooth. He sailed west, towards the edge of the known world, and was shipwrecked on the coast of Fife, Scotland. However, the relics were probably brought to Britain in 597 as part of the Augustine Mission, and then in 732 to Fife, by Bishop Acca of Hexham, a well-known collector of religious relics. The skull of Saint Andrew, which had been taken to Constantinople, was returned to Patras by Emperor Basil I, who ruled from 867 to 886. In 1208, following the sack of Constantinople, those relics of Saint Andrew and Saint Peter which remained in the imperial city were taken to Amalfi, Italy, by Cardinal Peter of Capua, a native of Amalfi. A cathedral , was built, dedicated to Saint Andrew , to house a tomb in its crypt where it is maintained that most of the relics of the apostle, including an occipital bone, remain. Thomas Palaeologus was the youngest surviving son of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. Thomas ruled the province of Morea, the medieval name for the Peloponnese. In 1461, when the Ottomans crossed the Strait of Corinth, Palaeologus fled Patras for exile in Italy, bringing with him what was purported to be the skull of Saint Andrew. He gave the head to Pope Pius II, who had it enshrined in one of the four central piers of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and then in Pienza, Italy. In September 1964, Pope Paul VI, as a gesture of goodwill toward the Greek Orthodox Church, ordered that all of the relics of Saint Andrew that were in Vatican City be sent back to Patras. Cardinal Augustin Bea along with many other cardinals presented the skull to Bishop Constantine of Patras on 24 September 1964. The cross of Saint Andrew was taken from Greece during the Crusades by the Duke of Burgundy. It was kept in the church of St. Victor in Marseilles until it returned to Patras on 19 January 1980. The cross of the apostle was presented to the Bishop of Patras Nicodemus by a Catholic delegation led by Cardinal Roger Etchegaray. All the relics, which consist of the small finger, the skull , and the cross on which he was martyred, have been kept in the Church of St. Andrew at Patras in a special shrine and are revered in a special ceremony every 30 November, his feast day. In 2006, the Catholic Church, again through Cardinal Etchegaray, gave the Greek Orthodox Church another relic of Saint Andrew.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

The reason he greeted people with, \"I hate you,\" he explained, is because saying \"I love you\" is too often used as a form of manipulation.  He created his own following. The group has a practice, initiated by Hawthorne, of pushing one another for what they want. Hawthorne indicated that this is about feeling out the other person's energy and communicating something to the other person about \"where they are coming from\".  The idea is to avoid negative conflict by bringing such differences out in the open, rather than creating situations where people rob or con one another for what they want. For a couple of years, he initiated a nightly \"hate camp\" drum circle at Sproul Plaza, where local people released their animosity. \"Hate camp\" was known as the camp that formed around him.

In 1959, the Cleftones' manager, George Goldner, convinced the group that their future resided in re-recording existing songs with an established popularity. By this time, Charles James had grown more proficient on the guitar, and the group and Goldner used that to develop a new arrangement of the piece. At that time, a local prominent disc jockey set up a recording session in Rochester, New York,  to record \"Heart and Soul\" and, arranged for singer Pat Spann's boyfriend Panama Francis to play drums and 15-year-old/future Grammy Award winner Duane Hitchings to play keyboards.

After Bush is jailed in New Jersey for rowdiness following a football game, his father, George H. W. Bush states that he will help him, but for the last time. Following his graduation from Yale, Bush takes a job at an oil patch back in Texas, but he quits after a few weeks. In 1971, \"Junior\" reveals his real aspirations in a father-son talk: working in professional baseball. Bush is accepted into Harvard Business School with the help of his father.  After a night of heavy drinking, Bush crashes his car into his family estate and challenges his father to a fistfight. His younger brother, Jeb, stops the fight. In 1977, Bush announces he will run for Congress to represent Texas's 19th district. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, who says that Bush is not a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with the highest number of votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history. In 1986, Bush becomes a born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his relationship with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself, but that he has not yet done anything with his life. Bush becomes a front office executive of the Texas Rangers baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the Gulf War. Although Allied forces win the war within 100 hours, the elder Bush decides not to invade Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein.

Despite his parents' objection to him entering the race, he wins, becoming the 46th governor of Texas on January 17, 1995. In 2000, he makes a successful bid to become President. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Bush labels Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as the \"axis of evil\". In 2002, Bush searches for evidence that Saddam was creating nuclear weapons, and has the army prepared. All of Bush's White House staff supports him except Secretary of State Colin Powell, who states that invading Iraq would destabilize the country.

Bush discovers that Saddam gambled his regime and his life on the assumption that Bush was bluffing.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.

In 1985, Too Short started his solo career and released his debut album, Don't Stop Rappin' on Oakland record label 75 Girls Records And Tapes which, along with four 12\" releases, featured raw, simple drum beats from a LinnDrum drum machine.  This was also one of the first hip hop records to use the word \"bitch\" \u2013 a word which became one of the rapper's trademarks and was the focus of subsequent raps such as \"Ain't Nothin' but a Word to Me\". In the early 1990s, his self-produced beats came from mostly a TR-808 and from mid-to-late 2000s, a TR-909 was used. In 1985, Too Short and Freddie B. formed the label Dangerous Music to regionally distribute his music, and with others formed rap group the Dangerous Crew. Dangerous Music became Short Records, and then Up All Nite Records. With his 1988 release, Life Is...Too Short, he began using replayed established funk riffs with his beats. Subsequent work was primarily collaborative, including work with Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Scarface, and Pimp C. One of his notable collaborations during this period was on the track \"The World Is Filled...\" on the Notorious B.I.G. album Life After Death; he comes in on the third verse after Diddy and Biggie. Being featured on the album introduced him to a wider audience as well, due to his typical style contrasting greatly with the Mafioso theme of the album. He also appeared on TWDY's hit single \"Player's Holiday\" from their 1999 debut album Derty Werk as well as the Priority Records compilation Nuthin but a Gangsta Party. After these appearances, he began working on his eleventh album, Can't Stay Away.  The album included guest appearances by 8Ball & MJG, Jay-Z, Jermaine Dupri, Sean Combs, E-40, Daz Dillinger, Lil Jon, Soopafly, Scarface and B-Legit. Too Short relocated to Atlanta in 1994, but he did not begin working with a more diverse variety of Southern artists until 2000, when he collaborated with Lil Jon. With the 1999 release of Can't Stay Away, Too Short came out of retirement, continuing his sexually explicit, relaxed style of rap. New albums released 2000\u20132003 were You Nasty , Chase the Cat , What's My Favorite Word? , and Married to the Game .  These albums all charted fairly well, as they all were in the top 71 of the Billboard 200, but they did not do as well as Too Short's earlier 1990s releases, as none of them reached the top 10. For his next album, Blow the Whistle , Too Short now took advantage of the new hyphy rap music that was emerging out of his original home base in Oakland. This saw somewhat of a resurgence for Too Short as it peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard 200, much better than each of his previous three releases.  However, his subsequent releases, such as 2007's Get Off the Stage, have not been as successful. On October 7, 2008, Too Short was honored by VH1 at the fifth annual \"Hip-Hop Honors\" along with Cypress Hill, De La Soul, Slick Rick and Naughty By Nature. In 2009, Too Short recorded for Daz Dillinger, Lil Jon, Soopafly, Scarface and B-Legit. In 2011, the rapper was featured on Wiz Khalifa's song \"On My Level\".

Frustrated, he asks the priest what he should do with his mundane life, and the priest tells him that he should repent, sacrifice all his palatial pleasures, and live the life of a simple and ordinary man, and hence learn the true meaning of life, for at least six months.

He goes to a nearby village, and a blind woman there mistakes him for her long-lost son and starts calling him Sajjan Singh. Shamsher decides to play along as Sajjan. Two corrupt palace officials spot Sajjan, and notice his similarity to Shamsher, and conspire with him to pose as Shamsher for a hefty sum of money, to which Sajjan agrees. When he accompanies the officials back to the palace, he is shocked to find that his father has remarried a much younger woman, Ratna, and shortly after marrying her, has died, leaving the palace and its management to her and her greedy brother.

There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\". Stephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could \"remember hating\". However, in his 1981 nonfiction book Danse Macabre, King noted that Kubrick was among those \"filmmakers whose particular visions are so clear and fierce that...fear of failure never becomes a factor in the equation,\" commenting that \"even when a director such as Stanley Kubrick makes such a maddening, perverse, and disappointing film as The Shining, it somehow retains a brilliance that is inarguable; it is simply there,\" and listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have \"contributed something of value to the [horror] genre.\" Before the 1980 film, King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work. The novel, written while King was suffering from alcoholism, contains an autobiographical element. King expressed disappointment that some themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less present in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would go insane, due to Nicholson's famous role as Randle McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . King had suggested that a more \"everyman\" actor such as Jon Voight, Christopher Reeve, or Michael Moriarty play the role, so that Jack's descent into madness would be more unnerving. In the novel, the story takes the child's point of view, while in the film the father is the main character; in fact, one of the most notable differences lies in Jack Torrance's psychological profile. According to the novel, the character represented an ordinary and balanced man who little by little loses control; Furthermore, the written narration reflected personal traits of the author himself at that time , in addition to abuse. There is some allusion to these episodes in the American version of the film. In an interview with the BBC, King criticized Duvall's performance, stating the character is \"basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that's not the woman that I wrote about.\" King's Wendy is a strong and independent woman on a professional and emotional level; to Kubrick, on the other hand, it did not seem consistent that such a woman had long endured the personality of Jack Torrance. King once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make\u00a0\u2013 whether it's to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety\u00a0\u2013 are what matter to him. But in Kubrick's The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It's a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King's novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like \"insects\" because the director doesn't really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick's highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King's The Shining, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick's, the monster is Kubrick.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He referred to this phenomenon as Le pouvoir de la vie or la force qui tend sans cesse \u00e0 composer l'organisation . Lamarck believed in the ongoing spontaneous generation of simple living organisms through action on physical matter by a material life force. Lamarck ran against the modern chemistry promoted by Lavoisier , preferring to embrace a more traditional alchemical view of the elements as influenced primarily by earth, air, fire, and water. He asserted that once living organisms form, the movements of fluids in living organisms naturally drove them to evolve toward ever greater levels of complexity: He argued that organisms thus moved from simple to complex in a steady, predictable way based on the fundamental physical principles of alchemy. In this view, simple organisms never disappeared because they were constantly being created by spontaneous generation in what has been described as a \"steady-state biology\". Lamarck saw spontaneous generation as being ongoing, with the simple organisms thus created being transmuted over time becoming more complex. He is sometimes regarded as believing in a teleological process where organisms became more perfect as they evolved, though as a materialist, he emphasized that these forces must originate necessarily from underlying physical principles. According to the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, \"Lamarck denied, absolutely, the existence of any 'perfecting tendency' in nature, and regarded evolution as the final necessary effect of surrounding conditions on life.\" Charles Coulston Gillispie, a historian of science, has written \"life is a purely physical phenomenon in Lamarck\", and argued that Lamarck's views should not be confused with the vitalist school of thought.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

It has been reprinted in several anthologies, including the revised edition of Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos, indicating that it is part of the Cthulhu Mythos genre. While on a fishing trip in the Adirondack Mountains, horror illustrator Colin Leverett encounters an old abandoned house surrounded by bizarre stick formations. Enthusiastically sketching the strange constructions, he enters the house and is attacked by a lich in the basement, from whom he narrowly escapes. Many years later, Leverett is contacted by a descendant of a famous horror author, H. Kenneth Allard , who hires him to illustrate a volume of Allard's previously unpublished stories. When Leverett decides to base the illustrations on his old sketches of the stick lattices, he is unwittingly drawn into a supernatural conspiracy of potentially apocalyptic magnitude. The mysterious lattices of twigs were inspired by the work of Weird Tales artist Lee Brown Coye, who illustrated two Carcosa Press volumes which Wagner edited: Manly Wade Wellman's Worse Things Waiting and Hugh B.

More problems built up with the boll weevil infestation, when thousands of agricultural jobs were lost. Jimmie Rodgers, a native of Meridian and guitarist/singer/songwriter known as the \"Father of Country Music\", played a significant role in the development of the blues. He and Chester Arthur Burnett were friends and admirers of each other's music. Their friendship and respect is an important example of Mississippi's musical legacy. While the state has had a reputation for being racist, Mississippi musicians created new forms by combining and creating variations on musical traditions from African American traditions, and the musical traditions of white Southerners strongly shaped by Scots-Irish and other styles. The state is creating a Mississippi Blues Trail, with dedicated markers explaining historic sites significant to the history of blues music, such as Clarksdale's Riverside Hotel, where Bessie Smith died after her auto accident on Highway 61. The Riverside Hotel is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale. The Delta Blues Museum there is visited by tourists from all over the world.

Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do.

Hansen grew up amid Andy Warhol's The Factory art scene of the 1960s in New York City and was a Warhol superstar. She moved to California at age 17 and met Campbell there. Beck's maternal grandmother was Jewish, while his maternal grandfather, artist Al Hansen, was of Norwegian descent and was a pioneer in the avant-garde Fluxus movement. Beck has said that he was \"raised celebrating Jewish holidays\" and that he considers himself Jewish. Beck was born in a rooming house near downtown Los Angeles. As a child, he lived in a declining neighborhood near Hollywood Boulevard. He later recalled, \"By the time we left there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks.\" The lower-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees. He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in Kansas, later remarking that he thought \"they were kind of concerned\" about his \"weird\" home life. Since his paternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns. He also spent time in Europe with his maternal grandfather. After his parents separated when he was 10, Beck stayed with his mother and brother Channing in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city's diverse musical offerings\u2014everything from hip hop to Latin music and his mother's art scene\u2014all of which would later reappear in his work. Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park. During his teens, Beck discovered the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, and X, but remained uninterested in most music outside the folk genre until many years into his career. The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the early 1980s. Growing up in a predominantly Latin district, he found himself the only white child at his school, and quickly learned how to breakdance. When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a friend's house, and spent hours in his room trying to emulate Hurt's finger-picking techniques. Shortly thereafter, Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson. Feeling like \"a total outcast\", Beck dropped out of school after junior high. He later said that although he felt school was important, he felt unsafe there. When he applied to the new performing arts high school downtown, he was rejected. His brother took him to post-Beat jazz places in Echo Park and Silver Lake. He hung out at the Los Angeles City College, perusing records, books and old sheet music in its library. He used a fake ID to sit in on classes there, and he also befriended a literature instructor and his poet wife.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin , which explains in part why Passage seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\" The SF Site review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long.

Time called it \"the most famous fashion song of all time\", although the song was not specifically about the [Vogue] magazine. Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream. She introduced the world to this community who, up until that point in time, had been a subculture.\" Vogueing has since become a prominent dance form practised worldwide, and many performers have followed Madonna's footsteps, with Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Azealia Banks all adopting the dance style and incorporating it into their music videos and performances. South Korean singer Luna's song \"Madonna\" referenced \"Vogue\" on its lyrics, \"When I grow up, I wanna be like Madonna / When I grow up, I wanna vogue how I wanna\". The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song \"was instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" \"Vogue\" has inspired flash mobs around the US. In 2015, the rhythmic gymnastics group from Ukraine used the track for their 6 clubs and 2 hoops routine, which was intended to be shown at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.

Carpenter is uncannily skilled, for example, at the use of foregrounds in his compositions, and everyone who likes thrillers knows that foregrounds are crucial . ... \" The opening title, featuring a jack-o'-lantern placed against a black backdrop, sets the mood for the entire film. The camera slowly moves toward the jack-o'-lantern's left eye as the main title theme plays. After the camera fully closes in, the jack-o'-lantern's light dims and goes out. Film historian J.P. Telotte says that this scene \"clearly announces that [the film's] primary concern will be with the way in which we see ourselves and others and the consequences that often attend our usual manner of perception.\" Carpenter's first-person point-of-view compositions were employed with steadicam; Telotte argues, \"As a result of this shift in perspective from a disembodied, narrative camera to an actual character's eye ... we are forced into a deeper sense of participation in the ensuing action.\" Along with the 1974 Canadian horror film Black Christmas, Halloween made use of seeing events through the killer's eyes. The first scene of the young Michael's voyeurism is followed by the murder of Judith seen through the eye holes of Michael's clown costume mask. According to scholar Nicholas Rogers, Carpenter's \"frequent use of the unmounted first-person camera to represent the killer's point of view ... invited [viewers] to adopt the murderer's assaultive gaze and to hear his heavy breathing and plodding footsteps as he stalked his prey.\" Film analysts have noted its delayed or withheld representations of violence, characterized as the \"false startle\" or \"the old tap-on-the-shoulder routine\" in which the stalkers, murderers, or monsters \"lunge into our field of vision or creep up on a person.\" Critic Susan Stark described the film's opening sequence in her 1978 review: LegacyHalloween is a widely influential film within the horror genre; it was largely responsible for the popularization of slasher films in the 1980s and helped develop the slasher genre. Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream satirized. The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer. There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night ,  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Black Christmas which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting. Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, he has two shortcomings that he needs to self-examine: his overindulgence in hunting and music.  Both of these have harm for the state. Murong Wei, who was also present and was told by Murong Jun to review himself, bore grudges from Li from this point on. In early 360, Murong Jun grew ill, and because Murong Wei was still just a child, he offered the throne to his able brother Murong Ke the Prince of Taiyuan.  However, Murong Ke declined and persuaded Murong Jun that he would be able to also ably assist the young emperor.  Murong Jun therefore entrusted Murong Wei to Murong Ke, his uncle Murong Ping, Yang Wu, and Muyu Gen, but with Murong Ke in the role of regent.  He died soon after, and Murong Wei succeeded him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Roger Ebert reiterated Gene Siskel's earlier opinion, stating that the film was \"basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship.\" He described it as one of several science fiction pictures that were \"real disappointments\" compared to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, in both episodes Ebert singled out the early scene of the Nostromo crew exploring the alien planet for praise,  calling the scene \"inspired,\" said that it showed \"real imagination\" and claimed that it transcended the rest of the film. Over two decades later, Ebert had revised his opinion of the film, including it on his Great Movies list, where he gave it four stars and said \"Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original.\" In 1980, the film was included in Cinefantastiques list of the top films of the 1970s while failing to make the magazine's top ten. Frederick S. Clarke, the magazine's editor, wrote that Alien was \"an exercise in style, refreshingly adult in approach, wickedly grim and perverse, that manages to compensate for a lack of depth in both story and characters.\" In 1982, John Simon of the National Review praised the cast of Alien, particularly Sigourney Weaver, and the film's visual values. Simon also wrote, \"For fanciers of horror, among whose numbers I do not count myself, Alien is recommendable, provided they are free from hypocrisy and finicky stomachs\". Despite initial mixed reviews, Alien has received critical acclaim over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment, and is cited one of the best films of 1979. It is seen as one of the most influential science-fiction films. It holds a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 125 reviews and an average rating of 9.11/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A modern classic, Alien blends science fiction, horror and bleak poetry into a seamless whole.\" Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Halliwell's Film Guide awarded it a full four stars, describing it as \"a classic of suspense and art direction\". Alan Jones of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five, describing it as a \"revolutionary 'haunted house in space' thrill-ride [...] stunning you with shock after shock\", praising the \"top-notch acting [...] and imaginative bio-mechanical production design\", as well as \"Ridley Scott's eye for detail and brilliant way of alternating false scares with genuine jolts, which help to create a seamless blend of gothic horror and harrowing science fiction\". Critical interest in the film was re-ignited with the theatrical release of the \"Director's Cut\" in 2003. Roger Ebert ranked it among \"the most influential of modern action pictures\" and praised its pacing, atmosphere, and settings: David McIntee praises Alien as \"possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings.\" He notes that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: \"It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal.\" Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th , he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: \"The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.\" He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: \"Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim.\" David Edelstein wrote, \"Alien remains the key text in the 'body horror' subgenre that flowered in the seventies, and Giger's designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety. Men traveled through vulva-like openings, got forcibly impregnated, and died giving birth to rampaging gooey vaginas dentate \u2014 how's that for future shock? This was truly what David Cronenberg would call 'the new flesh,' a dissolution of the boundaries between man and machine, machine and alien, and man and alien, with a psychosexual invasiveness that has never, thank God, been equaled.\" In 2008, the American Film Institute ranked Alien as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre as part of AFI's 10 Top 10, a CBS television special ranking the ten greatest movies in ten classic American film genres. The ranks were based on a poll of over 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians, with Alien ranking just above Terminator 2: Judgment Day and just below Scott's other science fiction film Blade Runner . The same year, Empire magazine ranked it thirty-third on its list of the five hundred greatest movies of all time, based on a poll of 10,200 readers, critics, and members of the film industry. In 2021, Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number two in the \"25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made\".

A moment later, Glory is there and captures a Lei-Ach demon, who tells her that Buffy is the Slayer. Glory sends it and its friends to kill her. Buffy decides to leave on-campus accommodation and move back to the Summers house to be closer to her ailing mother. The gang assists with packing boxes, and Willow reminds everyone about Tara's upcoming 20th birthday. Later at The Magic Box, Buffy and Xander struggle to come up with ideas for presents for Tara, coming to the realization that they do not really know her very well. They similarly struggle to find information on Glory, since Buffy's best description that she resembles Cordelia proves too vague to be of use. A young man comes into The Magic Box and disparages magic. He reveals himself as Tara's big brother, Donny, who has come to town with their father and cousin Beth for Tara's birthday. While Tara is clearly not thrilled at their presence, she agrees to have dinner with her family that evening. Tara returns to her room to find her father there. He expresses disappointment that she has not quit magic and berates her for being out of reach for months. He reminds her that all women in the family show their demon selves after their 20th birthday, which is why her family has come for her. After he leaves, Willow returns and wants to repeat the demon location spell that Tara had secretly sabotaged previously. Tara fakes fatigue, so Willow returns to the magic shop. Tara secretly follows her and, from hiding, casts a spell to prevent her friends from seeing demonic manifestations of evil. Meanwhile, Riley is drinking alone in Willy's old demon bar after another argument with Buffy about her isolationism. Sandy hits on him, but he recognizes her as a vampire. In his crypt, Harmony tells Spike that the Lei-Ach demons have been summoned to kill Buffy. Spike, who had earlier been fantasizing about fighting Buffy while having sex with Harmony, leaves to help, although he tells Harmony that he is going to watch and enjoy her death. Beth finds Tara, and derides her for being \"selfish\", leaving her father and brother to fend for themselves. Beth realizes that Tara has cast a spell on her friends, then leaves to find Tara's father to inform him what his daughter has done. Three Lei-Ach demons arrive to attack Buffy, but because of Tara's spell they are invisible to the gang. They search for the Slayer and attack everyone in their path. Giles hides Dawn under a desk. Only Buffy manages to put up a decent fight. Spike arrives and fights one of the Lei-Achs, although, being demon himself, his entire scuffle is unseen by Buffy. Tara arrives, realizes her spell has gone awry, and breaks it. The demons can again be seen and are quickly beaten. Tara's family arrives and her father explains Tara's demonic heritage to her friends. Willow is visibly hurt that Tara has hidden this from her, and Tara tries to re-affirm her love for Willow. When Tara's family insists on taking her away against her wishes, all her friends make it clear they will fight to defend her, declaring that, while the Maclays may be her blood kin, her friends are her real family. Anya then asks Tara's father and Beth what kind of demon Tara is. Their refusal to give a straight answer and Mr. Maclay's puzzled look arouse Spike's suspicion, so he punches Tara in the nose, activating Spike's chip and proving that Tara is, in fact, human. Spike concludes that the legend of the Maclay women assuming their demonic heritages upon adulthood is just an old family myth maintained by the Maclay males to keep their women frightened and subordinate to them. Bolstered by the knowledge that she is fully human, Tara declares she will stay with her new family, and confidently tells her relatives to leave, which they do after a slight hesitation.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

For two years, it also faced CBS' The Price Is Right, already a major hit. After continued mediocrity in the Nielsen ratings, ABC was prepared to cancel General Hospital, but decided to give it a second chance in 1978 when it expanded the show from an experimental 45 minutes to a full hour. However, the expansion came with an ultimatum to the producers that they had six months to improve the show's ratings. Gloria Monty was hired as the new executive producer, and on her first day, she spent an extra $100,000 re-taping four episodes. A miracle occurred thanks to Monty and head writer Douglas Marland; the show became the most-watched daytime drama by 1979, marking a rare instance of a daytime serial's comeback from near-extinction. During the wedding of Luke and Laura on November 17, 1981, about 30 million people tuned in to watch them exchange vows and be cursed by Elizabeth Taylor's Helena Cassadine . From 1979 to 1988, General Hospital remained number one in the ratings, competing against two game shows and two low-rated soaps on NBC\u2014Texas and Santa Barbara\u2014and Guiding Light on CBS . For the most part, however, General Hospital continued to triumph, even after the departure of popular actors Anthony Geary and Genie Francis in the mid-1980s. Although The Young and the Restless took General Hospital's place as the highest-rated serial in 1989, General Hospital continued to maintain excellent ratings. Even at its peak in the 1980s, General Hospital had been pre-empted in at least two markets in the United States. With the show still number one in the Nielsens, WDTN in Dayton, Ohio preempted the series upon joining ABC in January 1980 in favor of Woody Woodpecker and Super Friends cartoons. Later, the station would air such shows as Hour Magazine, Geraldo and Maury in the show's timeslot until September 2000, when the station's new owners, Sunrise Broadcasting , pulled Maury from the station's schedule, due to what it called \"community standards\", and brought General Hospital back to Dayton. In Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York, WVNY dropped General Hospital from the schedule in the 1980s and would only bring it back in 1995. During that hiatus, General Hospital still aired on Montreal's CFCF-DT, whose signal was decently available in Vermont and Plattsburgh. Ever since the 1991\u20131992 season of General Hospital, the show has had a steady decline in ratings. On and off, it would rank between third and fifth place in the Nielsen ratings, with CBS's The Young And The Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful coming in first and second place, respectively. General Hospital remained in between third and fifth place in the ratings during that time, and from late 1991 to 1996 All My Children held the title of ABC's highest-rated soap. After months of speculation and cancellation rumors, Deadline Hollywood reported on April 11, 2012, that ABC quietly made the decision to keep General Hospital on the air and to cancel instead the lower-rated talk show The Revolution. On June 26, 2012, ABC officially announced that General Hospital would move to the 2 p.m. ET/PT timeslot starting on September 10, 2012, and that the network would give the 3:00\u00a0p.m. hour back to its affiliates, as it was the recommended time slot for Katie Couric's new, ABC-syndicated talk show, Katie. Encore episodes were shown every weeknight on the former cable channel Soapnet, with a marathon on Saturday and classic episodes at 4 a.m. EST and 5 a.m. . Production of General Hospital was suspended in March 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The show had banked roughly two months' worth of episodes at that time.  By airing repeats on \"Flashback Fridays\", General Hospital was able to air original episodes through the end of May 21, 2020. This will be followed by several weeks of vintage episode repeats. Production resumed on July 22, 2020, and new episodes began airing on August 3, 2020.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Nolan has denied that the film criticizes the Occupy movement, and insists that none of his Batman films are intended to be political: \"I've had as many conversations with people who have seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' \u2013 well, obviously, that's not true.\" Alternatively, politically-conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh alleged that the film was biased against 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney due to Bane's name being a homophone for Bain Capital, the financial service company Romney used to head, despite the fact that the character has existed as a major Batman foe since 1993. In response, Nolan said that the comments were \"bizarre\", while Dixon and Freeman said that the comments were \"ridiculous\". Democratic adviser Christopher Lehane has noted the similarities between the narratives of the film and the presidential campaign. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek argued that film was inspired by the French Revolution as portrayed by novelist Charles Dickens. On January 20, 2017, multiple media outlets noted that a small but key part of U.S. president Donald Trump's inaugural address \"had an uncanny echo\" of Bane's speech after he takes control of Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises. Trump had given the film a positive review in 2012. In 2019, Warner Bros. threatened legal action after Trump used the film's score for a 2020 campaign video without permission. According to Matthew Rozsa of Salon, \"The Christopher Nolan-directed film \u2014 and, more specifically, its fascistic revolutionary villain, Bane \u2014 has been referenced in racist hate speech directed against Black Lives Matter protesters by the popular alt-right site Virginia Dare and throughout the far right corners of the Internet.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others.

Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence.

In the late 1960s he was widely known as a protest singer. He recorded over 300 songs, most of which were his own compositions, with lyrics written by Vexi Salmi. Irwin Goodman started as a protest song singer in the folk boom of the mid-1960s; his humorous songs, often mocking the authorities, became favorites of the Finnish people, to the extent that small Irwin singalike contests are still held by some pubs for entertainment. Goodman had continuing troubles with Finnish tax authorities and had ever-worsening problems with alcohol. His escapades were eagerly followed by sensationalist magazines such as Hymy. Goodman died of a heart attack while on the way from Vyborg to Hamina, Finland. The story of his life was turned into a feature film, Rentun Ruusu, in 2001. Irwin's most famous songs include \"Poing Poing Poing\" , \"Haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta\" , \"Rentun ruusu\" , \"Ei tippa tapa\" , \"Ty\u00f6miehen lauantai\" , \"En kerro kuinka jouduin naimisiin\" and \"Tytt\u00f6 tuli\" .

An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000. Shubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis. The actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.

His wife Gwen suggests that it would make him feel better if he wrote down what was bothering him. Many years prior, Thomas is taken in by a kindly community of field mice after being caught in a snowstorm. There he meets Woodget, a little field mouse who becomes his close friend, and a beautiful maiden named Bess Sandibrook. Thomas falls deeply in love with Bess, but is unaware that Woodget has similar feelings for her. Stating that she loves Woodget, Bess gently rejects Thomas, only for them both to realise that Woodget has run away after mistakenly thinking he's getting in the way of their romance. Thomas vows to find Woodget, and catches up with him at a dock as a ship called the Calliope is getting ready to set sail. Thomas and Woodget meet a tough Irish mouse named Mulligan, who invites them to have a drink with him on the ship before he leaves. But they stay too long and to their dismay are stuck on the ship. The two become suspicious of Mulligan, who is evasive and will not let anyone see the contents of a satchel he always carries with him. The Calliope eventually crashes in a violent storm, killing most of its passengers. Mulligan washes ashore in Crete with Dimlon, a simple-minded young mouse Thomas and Woodget befriended during the voyage. Dimlon drops his facade of innocence and reveals himself to Mulligan as Dahrem Ruhar, an adept of the Scale, an evil cult that worships a banished reptile god called Suruth Scarophion. Mulligan has been carrying a piece of a jade egg sacred to the Scale, trying to prevent them from obtaining it and joining it with the other pieces, which would create a vessel into which Scarophion can be reborn. Thomas and Woodget survived the storm as well, and come onto the island in time to see a dying Mulligan, poisoned by the blades of Dahrem. He has carried the egg fragment with him and pushes it into the horrified Woodget's paws, telling him to take it to a place called Hara. Thomas and Woodget are discovered by an army of Indian mongooses who demand to know where they got the egg fragment from. After they explain the situation, the mongooses offer to take the two mice to Hara, their home city in India so they can speak to the sadhu and ask his advice. Dahrem, once again in the guise of Dimlon, comes along with them. Upon their arrival in Hara, Thomas, Woodget and mongoose Captain Chattan go to see the sadhu, who also possesses a piece of the jade egg of Scarophion. In the night, the Scale arrive and launch a vicious attack on the city of Hara to steal the fragment. To everyone's shock, it is the sadhu himself who opens the gates for the Scale to enter. Dahrem attacks Woodget in the sadhu's chamber, demanding that he hand over the egg fragment Mulligan gave him. Thomas and Chattan hear the field mouse's screams and come to his rescue. Chattan engages in battle with Dahrem, who demonstrates his ability as an adept to tear his mammalian flesh off and assume the form of a lizard. Ultimately Dahrem is killed, but not before poisoning Chattan with his blades. Faced with nowhere else to go, Thomas and Woodget decide to head to Singapore, where it is said that the jerboa prophet Simoon has journeyed. In a seedy bar called the Lotus Parlour, Thomas accidentally lets it slip to the bar's owner, Ma Skillet, that he and Woodget have the final egg fragment. Simoon is present and scolds the two mice for having walked directly into Scale territory. The bar is full of members of the cult who capture Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon and take them to their temple. The high priest joins the egg fragments together, and it appears Suruth Scarophion will be reborn. But as the reptilian form writhes within the newly created egg, it suddenly shrivels and dies. Simoon reveals that it was the plan all along to let the Scale obtain every piece of the egg, as he and other members of the Green Council like the sadhu knew it would ultimately be useless. The fragment held by Mulligan was periodically moved to different shrines to the benevolent Green Mouse deity, and thus gradually became a holy object. Cast from the ruined egg, Scarophion's spirit enters a nearby statue in his image. Riding on its back, the enraged high priest chases Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon. The statue is destroyed when it crashes on a crag of rock, and Woodget kills the high priest to save Thomas's life. At the end of the journey, Thomas and Woodget are at a dock in Singapore waiting for a ship to take them back to England. An old beggar approaches them, but soon they discover that it is Ma Skillet, former high priestess of the Scale. She puts Thomas into a trance, during which he picks up Woodget and casts him into the water. Despite the field mouse's pleas, Thomas lets him presumably drown. Hours later, Thomas emerges from the trance and to his horror, remembers what he has done. He screams in anguish. In present day Hara, Chattan's sister Sobhan is taking her grandson to see the sadhu. She tries to help the latter remember his former identity, but he responds that Zenna, the siren who rescued him from the sea, wiped his memory completely and he is content that way.

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream.

Giving a 1 out of 5, film critic Rajeev Masand panned the film, terming it an exercise in indulgence, and wrote, \"Spiffily shot and stylishly packaged, the new Don may wear a new look, but what it's clearly lacking is the raw energy, the unpredictability of Chandra Barot's original thriller.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_359", "question": "What genre is Grease?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_21387", "text": "Grease is a 1971 musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. Named after the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers, the musical is set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School and follows ten working-class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure, politics, personal core values, and love. The score borrows heavily from the sounds of early rock and roll. In its original production in Chicago, Grease was a raunchy, raw, aggressive, vulgar show. Subsequent productions sanitized it and toned it down.  The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy, peer pressure and gang violence; its themes include love, friendship, teenage rebellion, sexual exploration during adolescence, and, to some extent, class consciousness and class conflict. Jacobs described the show's basic plot as a subversion of common tropes of 1950s cinema, since the female lead, who in many 1950s films transformed the alpha male into a more sensitive and sympathetic character, is instead drawn into the man's influence and transforms into his wild, roguish fantasy. Grease was first performed in 1971 in the original Kingston Mines nightclub in Chicago . From there, it has been successful on both stage and screen, but the content has been diluted and its teenage characters have become less Chicago habitu\u00e9s and more generic. At the time that it closed in 1980, Greases 3,388-performance run was the longest yet in Broadway history, although it was surpassed by A Chorus Line on September 29, 1983. It went on to become a West End hit, a successful feature film, two popular Broadway revivals in 1994 and 2007, and a staple of regional theatre, summer stock, community theatre, and high school and middle school drama groups. It remains Broadway's 16th longest-running show. Grease was adapted in 1978 as a feature film also named Grease, which removed some plot elements, characters, and songs while adding new songs and elaborating on some plot elements only alluded to in the musical. Some of these revisions have been incorporated into revivals of the musical . A 2016 live TV musical used elements from both the original stage version and the film. A 1982 film sequel, Grease 2, included only a few supporting characters from the film and musical and had no involvement from Jacobs or Casey. Jacobs has gone on record to voice his disapproval of Grease 2.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_360", "question": "What genre is Halloween?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_67640", "text": "Scholar Carol J. Clover has argued that the film, and its genre at large, links sexuality with danger, saying that killers in slasher films are fueled by a \"psychosexual fury\" and that all the killings are sexual in nature. She reinforces this idea by saying that \"guns have no place in slasher films\" and when examining the film I Spit on Your Grave she notes that \"a hands-on killing answers a hands-on rape in a way that a shooting, even a shooting preceded by a humiliation, does not.\" Equating sex with violence is important in Halloween and the slasher genre according to film scholar Pat Gill, who made a note of this in her essay \"The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, and the Family\". She remarks that Laurie's friends \"think of their babysitting jobs as opportunities to share drinks and beds with their boyfriends. One by one they are killed ... by Michael Myers an asylum escapee who years ago at the age of six murdered his sister for preferring sex to taking care of him.\" Carpenter has distanced himself from these interpretations, saying \"It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.\" In another interview, Carpenter said that readings of the film as a morality play \"completely missed the point,\" adding, \"The one girl who is the most sexually uptight just keeps stabbing this guy with a long knife. She's the most sexually frustrated. She's the one that's killed him. Not because she's a virgin but because all that sexually repressed energy starts coming out. She uses all those phallic symbols on the guy.\" Some feminist critics, according to historian Nicholas Rogers, \"have seen the slasher movies since Halloween as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hard-core pornography.\" Critics such as John Kenneth Muir state that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of \"any good planning\" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in Halloween and Halloween II only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers. However, Clover has argued that despite the violence against women, Halloween and other slasher films turned women into heroines. In many pre-Halloween horror films, women are depicted as helpless victims and are not safe until they are rescued by a strong masculine hero. Despite the fact that Loomis saves Strode, Clover asserts that Halloween initiates the role of the \"final girl\" who ultimately triumphs in the end. Strode fights back against Myers and severely wounds him. Had Myers been a normal man, Strode's attacks would have killed him; even Loomis, the male hero of the story, who shoots Michael repeatedly with a revolver, cannot kill him. Aviva Briefel argued that moments such as when Michael's face was temporarily revealed are meant to give pleasure to the male viewer. Briefel further argues that these moments are masochistic in nature and give pleasure to men because they are willingly submitting themselves to the women of the film; they submit themselves temporarily because it will make their return to authority even more powerful. Critics, such as Gill, see Halloween as a critique of American social values. She remarks that parental figures are almost entirely absent throughout the film, noting that when Laurie is attacked by Michael while babysitting, \"No parents, either of the teenagers or of the children left in their charge, call to check on their children or arrive to keen over them.\" According to Gill, the dangers of suburbia is another major theme that runs throughout the film and the slasher genre at large: Gill states that slasher films \"seem to mock white flight to gated communities, in particular the attempts of parents to shield their children from the dangerous influences represented by the city.\" Halloween and slasher films, generally, represent the underside of suburbia to Gill. Myers was raised in a suburban household and after he escapes the mental hospital he returns to his hometown to kill again; Myers is a product of the suburban environment, writes Gill. Michael is thought by some to represent evil in the film. This is based on the common belief that evil never dies, nor does evil show any remorse. This idea is demonstrated in the film when Dr. Loomis discusses Michael's history with the sheriff. Loomis states, \"I spent eight years trying to reach him [Michael Myers], and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply ... evil.\" Loomis also refers to Michael as \"evil\" when he steals his car at the sanitarium.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes.

{"id": "91_371", "question": "What genre is The Tour?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24563", "text": "As the \"first true megamusical\", Cats pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals\u00a0\u2014 including Les Mis\u00e9rables , The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon \u2014 that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained: Cats introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting\u00a0\u2014 and then aggressively promoting\u00a0\u2014 a single recognisable image as the face of the show. The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline to create what The Daily Telegraph called \"one of musical theatre's greatest posters\". Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for Les Mis\u00e9rables and the Phantom's mask for The Phantom of the Opera. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called \"critic-proof\" status of megamusicals. Additionally, Cats was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official Cats t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry. Beyond the megamusical, Cats also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: \"Cats is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped. People do want a theatrical experience for their children.\" Thanks to its easily accessible spectacle, the original Broadway production also tapped into the then-burgeoning tourist boom in New York and its audience shifted increasingly towards foreign visitors in its later years. Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to Cats, citing the latter's disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience. The musical's fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey's pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an \"architectural manner\", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of Cats was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre. Cats opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote: In the 1980s, the success of local productions of Cats in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit. The musical was also a boon for the Broadway touring industry. In 1997, The New York Times credited the regional and touring productions of Cats with \"almost single-handedly reviv[ing] the sagging road business\". Cats revolutionised the touring business by introducing the now commonplace practice of extended touring engagements that can last several weeks or months in a single city, as opposed to the typical one-week or ten-day tour stop. Mackintosh's insistence that all touring productions of Cats replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical's demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Before the play starts, the cast spends time talking and interacting with the audience at the Courtroom Theatre, and some cast members hand out coloured juggling balls, to be used to pick the Lion from the audience.  An audience member is called upon at the start of the play to choose a colour , and the person holding that colour ball is then chosen as the lion.  During the 2nd act the remaining balls could be thrown down onto the \"stage\" where each ball would call out a different response.  For instance, if the yellow ball was the Lion, the green ball might pull a story, while the blue or red ball would call for what a cast member is thinking of at that particular time.  During intermission the coloured balls would be handed out again, and then once more be able to be thrown down on the \"stage\" and prompt the actors for other tidbits of information.  One colour would be for a summary of the epilogue, another for something an actor has gleaned from the massive prologue, that sort of thing.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group came together in 1992 where they formed the first version of Moist, which included drummer Jamie Kaufmann. The band began writing songs in November 1992 and played their first gig two months later. Drummer Paul Wilcox replaced Kaufmann in early 1993. In 1993, the band recorded a 9-song demo tape at the 8th Avenue Sound Studio with engineer Kevin Hamilton. Their sound was influenced by contemporary Seattle acts such as Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains .  The two-day recording session cost $500 Canadian dollars. The band had 500 copies of the untitled cassette pressed. The band found support from the staff at the flagship Sam the Record Man store in Vancouver. The cassette reached No. 1 on Sam the Record Man's local independent chart. The release was distributed to other stores in the national chain and entered the top 10 on Sam the Record Man's national independent chart. In 1993, Moist signed to EMI Music Publishing Canada. Moist spent much of 1993 touring Canada and writing material for an expanded release. In January 1994, they completed their first full-length album, which cost $3,000 Canadian dollars. The album was titled Silver and released independently on February 8, 1994. After MuchMusic began playing the music video for Moist's lead single \"Push\" in medium rotation, the album sold almost 6,000 records within six weeks. By March 1994, the band signed with EMI Music Canada. The Silver album went on to sell 400,000 copies in Canada on the strength of the singles \"Push\", \"Silver\", \"Believe Me\" and \"Machine Punch Through\". The band was also successful internationally in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Thailand. That year the band continued to tour around Canada. In 1995, the band won the Juno Award for \"Best New Group\". In late 1996, Moist released their second album, Creature, to favourable reviews and sales in excess of 300,000 units. The album included the hits \"Leave It Alone\", \"Resurrection\", \"Tangerine\", and \"Gasoline\", all of which were placed on high rotation on MuchMusic. In addition to these, a remixed version of \"Tangerine\" became a hit on radio and MuchMusic. Following the band's second record, David Usher released his first solo album, Little Songs. In early 1999, the band regrouped to record their third full-length album, the melancholic and soft-toned Mercedes 5 and Dime. The album was released in the summer of 1999 in Canada and later in 2000 in the United States. Singles included \"Breathe\", \"Underground\", and \"Comes and Goes\".  While touring in support of the album, drummer Paul Wilcox injured his back, causing him to miss the band's final performances. In December 2000, it was revealed that Wilcox had decided to take a \"potential permanent leave from the band.\" Wilcox never returned to the band and retired from music. The band released a compilation album and DVD in 2001, titled Machine Punch Through, and thereafter unofficially entered a hiatus period that would last 12 years. Hiatus During the band's hiatus, David Usher continued to record solo, releasing Morning Orbit in 2001, Hallucinations in 2003, If God Had Curves in 2005, Strange Birds in 2007, Wake Up and Say Goodbye in 2008, The Mile End Sessions in 2010, and Songs from the Last Day on Earth in 2012.

Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

The Northumbrian Anglo-Saxons used an Old English equivalent of the British name, , which was current until the 11th century, when, in a further parallel with Welsh usage, the first element fell out of use and the simple name Chester emerged. In 689, King \u00c6thelred of Mercia founded the Minster Church of West Mercia on what is considered to be an early Christian site: it is known as the Minster of St John the Baptist, Chester which later became the first cathedral.

Trubshaw named the game Multi-User Dungeon, in tribute to the Dungeon variant of Zork, which Trubshaw had greatly enjoyed playing. Zork in turn was inspired by an older text-adventure game known as Colossal Cave Adventure or ADVENT. MUD1 was written in the domain-specific programming language Multi User Dungeon Definition Language . Its first version was written by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw in BCPL. It was later ported to C++ and used in other MUDs such as MIST. In 1980, Roy Trubshaw created MUD version 3 in BCPL , to conserve memory and make the program easier to maintain. Richard Bartle, a fellow Essex student, contributed much work on the game database, introducing many of the locations and puzzles that survive to this day. Later that year Roy Trubshaw graduated from Essex University, handing over MUD to Richard Bartle, who continued developing the game. That same year, MUD1 became the first Internet multiplayer online role-playing game as Essex University connected its internal network to the ARPANET. In 1983, Essex University allowed remote access to its DEC-10 via British Telecom's Packet Switch Stream network between 2 am and 7 am each night. MUD became popular with players around the world, and several magazines wrote articles on this new trend. Between 1984 and 1987, MUD was hosted on the DEC-20 of Dundee College of Technology which was one of the few institutions to allow outside access. In 1984, Compunet, a UK-based network primarily for Commodore 64 users, licensed MUD1 and ran it from late 1984 until 1987, when CompuNet abandoned the DEC-10 platform they were using. Trubshaw and Bartle worked together at Multi-User Entertainment to create MUD2 the second generation of MUD. In 1985, Richard Bartle created MUD1 version 4, better known as MUD2. It was intended to be run as a service for British Telecom. In 1987, MUD1 was licensed by CompuServe, who pressured Richard Bartle to close down the instance of MUD1, better known as 'Essex MUD', that was still running at Essex University. This resulted in the deletion of the MUD account in October 1987. This left MIST, a derivative of MUD1 with similar gameplay, as the only remaining MUD running on the Essex University network, becoming one of the first of its kind to attain broad popularity. MIST ran until the machine that hosted it, a PDP-10, was superseded in early 1991. MUD1 ran under the name British Legends until late 1999 and was retired along with other software during CompuServe's Y2K cleanup efforts. In 2000, Viktor Toth rewrote the BCPL source code for MUD1 to C++ and opened it alongside MUD2 on British-legends.com. In 2014, Stanford University secured permission to redistribute the game's blueprints from the authors of MUD1.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The movie is also an example of a techno-thriller. The American Film Institute named Jurassic Park the 35th-most thrilling film of all time on June 13, 2001. On Empire magazine's 15th anniversary in 2004, it judged Jurassic Park the sixth-most influential film in the magazine's lifetime. Empire called the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus the 28th-most magical moment in cinema. In 2008, an Empire poll of readers, filmmakers, and critics also rated it one of the 500 greatest films of all time. On Film Reviews 55th anniversary in 2005, it declared the film to be one of the five most important in the magazine's lifetime. In 2006, IGN ranked Jurassic Park as the 19th-greatest film franchise ever. In a 2010 poll, the readers of Entertainment Weekly rated it the greatest summer movie of the previous 20 years. The popularity of the movie led the management of the National Basketball Association expansion franchise founded in Toronto in 1995 to adopt the nickname Raptors. In addition, during the team's playoff games, fans watch the game on a large television in a fan area outside the arena, which has been nicknamed Jurassic Park. The film is seen as giving rise to the \"Jurassic Park\" generation, to young people inspired to become paleontologists and to a surge in discoveries about dinosaurs in real life. Jurassic Park's biggest impact on subsequent films was a result of its computer-generated visual effects. Film historian Tom Shone commented on the film's innovation and influence, saying that, \"In its way, Jurassic Park heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927.\" Many filmmakers saw Jurassic Parks effects as a realization that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible. ILM owner George Lucas, realizing the success of creating realistic live dinosaurs by his own company, started to make the Star Wars prequels; Stanley Kubrick decided to invest in pet project A.I. Artificial Intelligence, to which he would later bring Spielberg to direct; and Peter Jackson began to re-explore his childhood love of fantasy films, a path that led him to The Lord of the Rings and King Kong. Jurassic Park has also inspired films and documentaries with dinosaurs such as the American adaptation of Godzilla, Dinosaur from the Deep, Carnosaur , Dinosaur Island and Walking with Dinosaurs. Stan Winston, enthusiastic about the new technology pioneered by the film, joined with IBM and director James Cameron to form a new special effects company, Digital Domain.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_400", "question": "What genre is Need to Believe?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_14943", "text": "Johnson's works, especially his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery. In his smaller poetic works, Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action. When it came to biography, Johnson disagreed with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life. Johnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote: \"I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style\". Although a smaller edition of his Dictionary became the standard household dictionary, Johnson's original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context. Johnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: \"If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them\". His works on Shakespeare were devoted not merely to Shakespeare, but to understanding literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago. On offense, Rodman's output was mediocre. He averaged 11.6 points per game in his second season, but his average steadily dropped: in the three championship seasons with the Bulls, he averaged five points per game and connected on less than half of his field goal attempts. His free throw shooting was considered a big liability: on December 29, 1997, Bubba Wells of the Dallas Mavericks committed six intentional fouls against him in only three minutes, setting the record for the fastest foul out in NBA history. The intention was to force him to attempt free throws, which in theory would mean frequent misses and easy ball possession without giving up too many points. However, this plan backfired, as Rodman hit 9 of the 12 attempts. This was Dallas coach Don Nelson's early version of what would later develop into the famous \"Hack-a-Shaq\" method that would be implemented against Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard, and other poor free throw shooters. In 14 NBA seasons, Rodman played in 911 games, scored 6,683 points, and grabbed 11,954 rebounds, translating to 7.3 points and 13.1 rebounds per game in only 31.7 minutes played per game. NBA.com lauds Rodman as \"arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history and one of the most recognized athletes in the world\" but adds \"enigmatic and individualistic, Rodman has caught the public eye for his ever-changing hair color, tattoos and, unorthodox lifestyle\". On the hardwood, he was recognized as one of the most successful defensive players ever, winning the NBA championship five times in six NBA Finals appearances , being crowned NBA Defensive Player of the Year twice and making seven NBA All-Defensive First Teams and NBA All-Defensive Second Teams . He additionally made two All-NBA Third Teams , two NBA All-Star Teams and won seven straight rebounding crowns and finally led the league once in field goal percentage . Rodman was recognized as the prototype bizarre player, stunning basketball fans with his artificial hair colors, numerous tattoos and body piercings, multiple verbal and physical assaults on officials, frequent ejections, and his tumultuous private life. He was ranked No. 48 on the 2009 revision of SLAM Magazines Top 50 Players of All-Time. Metta World Peace played one year with the 91 jersey number in homage to Rodman, who he described as a player who he liked \"on the court as a hustler, not when he kicked the cameraman.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Based on a story by O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, it follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo,  who encounter the eponymous Alien, an aggressive and deadly extraterrestrial set loose on the ship. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto. It was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill through their company Brandywine Productions, and was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script; Shusett was executive producer. The Alien and its accompanying artifacts were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human settings. Alien premiered May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival, presented in 70mm at midnight. It received a wide release on June 22 and was released September 6 in the United Kingdom. It was met with mixed reviews on release but was a box-office success, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, three Saturn Awards , and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. In 2002, Alien was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2008, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as the seventh-best film in the science-fiction genre, and as the 33rd-greatest film of all time by Empire. The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting career, providing her with her first lead role. The story of her character's encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels Aliens , Alien 3 , and Alien Resurrection .

Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford.

Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that.

Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence. But at the same time, how else are we going to make a film that faithfully mirrors the truth out there in our society? This is a story about misfits in a world of misfits.

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

It became a Top Twenty pop hit and a million-seller record. That year, Reese was voted by Billboard, Cashbox and various other magazines, as \"The Most Promising Singer\". In 1959, Reese moved to RCA Records and released her first RCA single, called \"Don't You Know?\", which was adapted from Giacomo Puccini's music for La boh\u00e8me, specifically the aria \"Quando m'en vo'\" . It became her biggest hit to date, reaching the number 2 spot on the pop charts and topping the R&B charts that year. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Eventually, the song came to be widely considered the signature song of her early career. She then released a successful follow-up single called \"Not One Minute More\" . She remained on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with \"And Now\" . In 1960 she released \"Someday \" , which was drawn from her Grammy-nominated album Della\u00a0\u2013 a big band outing arranged by Neal Hefti who incorporated some arrangement ideas conceived by Reese. In November 1960, Reese appeared in advertisements in Ebony magazine for the newly launched AMI Continental jukebox. Reese recorded regularly throughout the 1960s, releasing singles and several albums. Two of the most significant were The Classic Della and Waltz with Me, Della , which broadened her fan base internationally. She recorded several jazz-focused albums, including Della Reese Live , On Strings of Blue and One of a Kind . Live hit number 21 on the R&B charts. She also performed in Las Vegas for nine years, and toured across the country. She signed with Avco Embassy Records and released the soul-pop album Black is Beautiful in 1970, charting at number 44 on the R&B chart. In 1986, Reese formed the gospel group Brilliance with fellow singers O.C. Smith, Mary Clayton, Vermettya Royster, and Eric Strom. They released an album that  earned Reese a Grammy nomination in the gospel category for the song \"You Gave Me Love\" . She later earned another nomination for the album Live! My Soul Feels Better Right Now . Motown singer Martha Reeves cites Reese as a major influence, and says she named her group the Vandellas after Van Dyke Street in Detroit and Della Reese. In 2017, Reese was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona , but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\" Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

The story begins during the Third Reich. A crew of Wehrmacht soldiers is driving a cargo truck through the Black Forest when they are stopped by a road block of SS commandos. The SS hijack the truck and its cargo killing its passengers. Thirty-four years later, Harry Morgan is driving his Rolls Royce home in London, where a repossession agent is waiting to confiscate the car. Harry gives the agent the keys, as Harry boasts that he will soon own another one. He enters his family's apartment, where he has a brief conversation with his wife, Meredith , about their debts and the building that is soon to be sold. As he looks through the bills, he finds a letter addressed to him from someone in his past, requesting to meet with him. The following day, Harry meets Ernst Furben at the London Embassy Hotel. Ernst invites Harry to his hotel room, where they reminisce about the past, and Ernst brings up the story about the cargo. According to his story, he received an order for two guards, a heavy truck and a driver. The truck was assigned to collect a cargo from a railroad yard and deliver it to the Reich Bank. The driver named Hans Schmidt presented the order to the railroad official in charge to receive the cargo that was intercepted by a convoy of SS officers. They presented Schmidt with an order signed by a Nazi Party official to transport the cargo from the Balkans. Schmidt noticed the contents of gold bars when one of the crates was dropped. Schmidt was shipped out to the Eastern Front, where he was captured, and remained in prison until the year 1955. Twenty years later, Schmidt met Ernst again, and told him the story about the gold bars. During the war, an order could be countermanded by Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann G\u00f6ring, Martin Bormann, Rudolf Hess, or Reinhardt Holtz. Schmidt confirmed that Reinhardt Holtz was the Nazi party official who signed the transfer order. Ernst proposes that he and Harry join forces to release Holtz, to find out the location of the gold. After some discussion about a fellow inmate of the concentration camp, named Sergeant Prior, they discuss tentative ideas for releasing Holtz. A few days later, Harry travels to Amsterdam to find Sly playing chess with a Dutch teenage boy in a pub. Sly forfeits the game, and speaks to Harry, who tells him about the gold worth six million dollars. Sly initially refuses, but hears Harry out and agrees to the heist. Harry talks Sly into paying for two tickets to West Berlin, where they meet Ernst. They drive by Seigfried prison on the way to an expensive Berlin hotel, where Harry is ringing up an expensive tab for Ernst to pay. Harry goes to the store of Peter Dohlberg to ask him to finance the heist. Peter agrees to the heist for 15% of it. Harry reluctantly agrees, knowing he has no other options. Peter's employee, named Siggi, brings her friend Erika Kurtz to meet Harry. They arrange to have Udo Blimperman , an obese costume shop owner, give them the uniforms they need, in exchange for unlimited meals. Later that evening, Udo gets drunk and crashes through a table. Harry introduces Sly to Erika and Udo. Erika confirms that Udo will recover. The next morning, Harry wakes up to find that Sly and Erika had been playing chess all night, and that Udo had ordered another large meal for himself. Harry and Ernst meet Schmidt at a carnival to discuss his part in the heist. Harry meets Prior , who is now a prison sergeant at Seigfried prison. Harry mentions the scheme to the rest of the group at a hotel. Prior tells everyone about the security procedures at the prison, where the only man to speak to Holtz is a doctor named Maar . Prior offers to allow them to interrogate Holtz in his cell, but Sly says it will not work, stating that Holtz will not disclose the information to anyone outside the Nazi party. Sly informs Schmidt about his idea to stage a confidence game to trick Holtz, and use Erika as an assistant. When Ernst begins to object, Sly reassures him that his idea will not cost him his share. Sly has fallen in love with Erika, and they go on a walk together to discuss more details about the heist. They find an abandoned courthouse, which they pick the lock on, and decide to use it for their confidence game on Holtz. They purchase furnishings for the scheme, while Harry and Ernst purchase a used car to repaint as a United States Army staff car. Back at the hotel, Prior sets up a model of the prison to show where Holtz's cell is located. Ernst and Sly purchase a camera to photograph Maar with a transsexual named Pauli . Maar is blackmailed by Schmidt and Ernst, claiming that Pauli was Ernst's nephew. Knowing the police will not believe him, Maar agrees to switch places with Holtz, while Harry and Sly accompany them, disguised as United States Army officers. Holtz is drugged with a sedative, while Sly distracts the cell block guard with a ruse about a filthy cell, and orders him to clean it up. Prior relocks the door with the key that has been inadvertently left in the cell door and returns it to the guard, while Harry and Sly leave with Holtz, who is barely conscious enough to walk escorted. Harry makes up a cover story that Holtz needs to be seen by a dental surgeon the next day for an infection. Prior collaborates to ensure that no one else will see Holtz to ensure that no one else knows the surgeons identity, who is actually Ernst. Harry rebukes Prior for not having his name on the visitor's log as part of a ruse. They pick up Erika from work to change Holtz's appearance to make him look younger. As they arrive at the derelict courthouse, they change Holtz from Maar's borrowed civilian street clothes into a replica of his old Nazi uniform. Holtz is escorted into a courtroom furnished to look like a Third Reich office. Once inside the sedative wears off, he awakens to find himself in a staged meeting, with Schmidt disguised as Adolf Hitler, Sly disguised as an SS officer, and Ernst disguised as a Field Marshal. Schmidt states that Holtz stole the gold from the Reich and betrayed him. Holtz is confused about what Schmidt is referring to and asks what gold was stolen. Schmidt tells Holtz that the gold disappeared only seven days ago, and confirms that Holtz signed the order to have it deposited into the Reich Bank. Ernst escorts Holtz into another room to refresh his memory. Sly and Schmidt congratulate each other on their performances, while Ernst tells Holtz that Germany is winning the war and Holtz has been hospitalised. Holtz remembers that the gold was hidden to prevent Hermann G\u00f6ring from stealing it. He will only tell Hitler the exact location, though. Holtz whispers to Schmidt that the gold is hidden in his bunker, which is on the property of his summer home in Vanglitz. Holtz is given another sedative, while Schmidt admires a portrait of Hitler, comparing his likeness to it. Sly congratulates Schmidt, and Harry sarcastically says that they should do a double act with himself as Benito Mussolini. Schmidt gets carried away with his acting, while Ernst is worried Holtz may recognize the scam, and that their cover can still be blown by him reporting the incident to the prison guards. Sly proposes to return Holtz first thing in the morning before going after the gold, but Harry refuses to wait, worried that it could be found by anyone at any time. They cross the border into East Germany and everything goes well, despite Schmidt becoming nervous. They arrive at the summer home, to find that the bomb shelter has been built over by an apartment building. Further examination of one of the basement rooms reveals that the bunker is directly below, separated by three feet of concrete. Ernst contacts Wilhelm Schlager to arrange to get cooperation from the Soviet police garrison. Schlager insists on 1/8% of the heist for his inconvenience. He steps into another room and conceals a Walther PPK in his belt, while he calls Colonel Kosnikov of the Russian army. He plans for them to double cross the group, to get a two-way split for himself and Kosnokov. Kosnikov arrives with the Russian army, surrounds the house, and kills Schlager. Sly notices and secretly retrieves Schlager's handgun. Kosnikov demands a share for allowing them to stage a bomb threat to get access to the bunker. He reroutes his troops to the apartment building, and provides the group with equipment to impersonate a bomb disposal unit. The army evacuates the residents, so that they can begin drilling through the concrete floor. A boy wanders into the room where the dynamite is placed for the explosion. The boy is discovered at the last moment and safely removed before the explosion. Ernst announces that another bomb has been discovered, as a diversion to allow them to enter the hole leading to the bunker. Searching the bunker, the group finds two steel chests containing the gold behind a partition. Sly breaks the locks with a hammer and a chisel as the group admires their loot. After the gold is retrieved, Kosnikov shows up alone to intercept the group, armed with a machine gun. He tries to blackmail them and take all of the gold. As Schmidt pleads for their lives, Harry pins Kosnikov with a ladder. Kosnikov then shoots and kills Schmidt, after which Sly kills Kosnikov with Schlager's pistol. When the team returns to West Germany, they are confronted by the checkpoint guard about their flags on the wrong sides of the car's hood. The checkpoint guard puts the flags on correctly and allows them to leave. They throw Schmidt's body into a river. They pick up Erika, as well as Holtz, who is still sedated. They turn the gold over to Peter to have it divided up and converted from bullion to United States dollars. En route to the prison, they are forced to deal with a truck with toppled pallets blocking the road. They use the pallets to create a ramp to jump over the cargo truck and proceed to the prison. Returning to the prison, they are confronted by the United States Army colonel in charge of Seigfried, who demands an explanation about the unauthorized personnel at the prison. Harry cons their way out of the situation to allow Ernst access as the dental surgeon. Maar and Holtz are switched back to their proper places. Holtz wakes up in his cell to tell the guard that he believes he saw Hitler. As they leave the prison, Harry asks Ernst if he ever was really a Nazi. Ernst replies \"Not necessarily.\" After they abandon the staff car, Harry, Ernst and Sly walk away on the streets of Berlin.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_433", "question": "What genre is Open Water?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_12652", "text": "The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music, exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka, as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments like harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments such as the sitar and slide guitar in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. Jagger and Richards had a shared admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. Little Walter influenced Brian Jones. Richards recalls, \"He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'\" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer,  was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. \"Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four.\" Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&B artists, said it \"seemed the most real thing\" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the \"most powerful music [he had] ever heard\u00a0... the most expressive\". He also recalled, \"when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters\u2014and there were a lot of us\u2014in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, [it was] very\u00a0... heartwarming\". Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, \"Tell Me \", as a \"pop rock ballad\u00a0... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers\". \"As Tears Go By\", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, \"It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.\" The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US. Of their early writing experience, Richards said, \"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try\u00a0...'\" Jagger opined, \"We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order\u00a0 ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.\" The writing of \"The Last Time\", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it \"a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\" The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards. Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" responsible for part of their sound \u2013 the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's .  Likewise, Watts is primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio, the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four. Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts , most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning , as heard on the 1969 single \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Brown Sugar\" , \"Tumbling Dice\" , \"Happy\" , and \"Start Me Up\" . The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years. When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as \"World War III\". Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded \"by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions\". Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the Telegraph, \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He began writing the score in 2005, in the hope that starting this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged for the first time in October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too. Stanton originally wanted to juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music, but he saw The Triplets of Belleville and did not want to appear as if he were copying it. Stanton then thought about the song \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\" from Hello, Dolly!, since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production. Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love, which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. Jim Reardon, storyboard supervisor for the film, suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included \"It Only Takes a Moment\" and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. Hello Dolly! composer Jerry Herman allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story \"genius\". Coincidentally, Newman's uncle Lionel worked on Hello, Dolly! Newman travelled to London to compose the end credits song \"Down to Earth\" with Peter Gabriel, who was one of Stanton's favorite musicians. Afterwards, Newman rescored some of the film to include the song's composition, so it would not sound intrusive when played. Louis Armstrong's rendition of \"La Vie en rose\" was used for a montage where WALL-E attempts to impress EVE on Earth. The script also specified using Bing Crosby's \"Stardust\" for when the two robots dance around the Axiom, but Newman asked if he could score the scene himself. A similar switch occurred for the sequence in which WALL-E attempts to wake EVE up through various means; originally, the montage would play with the instrumental version of \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\", but Newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for the sequence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he considered it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, \"We've seen it all. It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. The interesting things are the ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning.\" In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, his parents were diagnosed with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, \"That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, one of these days I'm actually going to die.'\" While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, \"Darren and I just started talking about the story. We kept wanting to talk more about it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because it was so much fun.\" The director relied on a change of locale to inspire him to write Pi and Requiem for a Dream. For The Fountain, Aronofsky was inspired by a research trip he took to Guatemala with Handel to learn about Mayan history and philosophy. The script for The Fountain was influenced by the accounts of Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, who wrote examples of myth from an indigenous perspective, particularly Galeano's Genesis trilogy. The film Once Upon a Time in America also served as an influence on the script. Aronofsky, influenced by Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo's The Conquest of New Spain, applied the narrative in writing the film's conquistador scenes. Aronofsky realized that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between the armies of Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less inclined to mimic the scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director realized that, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death. The filmmakers researched space travel and Mayan culture, including its history, religion, and spirituality. They attended brain surgeries with the actors. With the research in place, Aronofsky said, \"We decided which things we wanted to be purely factual and which things we wanted to bend.\" The director did not strive to be historically accurate with the various time periods, perceiving the entire film as a setting of a fairy tale. He said, \"It was more about painting a relationship between a queen and her warrior, and just using that for more fantasy reasons.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Nolan has denied that the film criticizes the Occupy movement, and insists that none of his Batman films are intended to be political: \"I've had as many conversations with people who have seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' \u2013 well, obviously, that's not true.\" Alternatively, politically-conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh alleged that the film was biased against 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney due to Bane's name being a homophone for Bain Capital, the financial service company Romney used to head, despite the fact that the character has existed as a major Batman foe since 1993. In response, Nolan said that the comments were \"bizarre\", while Dixon and Freeman said that the comments were \"ridiculous\". Democratic adviser Christopher Lehane has noted the similarities between the narratives of the film and the presidential campaign. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek argued that film was inspired by the French Revolution as portrayed by novelist Charles Dickens. On January 20, 2017, multiple media outlets noted that a small but key part of U.S. president Donald Trump's inaugural address \"had an uncanny echo\" of Bane's speech after he takes control of Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises. Trump had given the film a positive review in 2012. In 2019, Warner Bros. threatened legal action after Trump used the film's score for a 2020 campaign video without permission.

He also authored a number of books on computer programming during the 1980s. In his earliest published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds up his own literary universe. The Dialog om det 21. \u00e5rhundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer, , is a philosophical dialogue modelled on the classical style of Galileo Galilei's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The plot is set in a not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new humanistic view on mankind and its new ideology , called Wulffianism. Wulffianism is anarchic in the word's real sense, entailing an acceptance of violence as a means and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy. Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned dialogues. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry is in rhyme, metrical with a touch of subtle pastiche. With the episodic novel Adam Harts Opdagelser <5> , Neutzsky-Wulff began to find his style and obtained henceforth crowds of fans. The book's protagonists are Adam Hart and his partner Victor Janis, both working as \"occult detectives\". An ironically rendered Neutzsky-Wulff himself also appears in a more secondary role. The series continues with the episodic Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen <6> Victor Janis og s\u00f8n <7> , both representing a more conventional novel structure, and ends with an experimental novel, Oiufael , mainly written in verse. An episode from Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen was adapted as the short film Adam Hart i Sahara , based on his own screenplay. Though sometimes he breaks the traditional conventions of the genre, Neutzsky-Wulff sees himself as an author of science fiction. He emphasizes the genre as the most prominent stage of artistic interpretations of the mythology of our time. Anno Domini tells the story of an astronaut on a strange planet, experiencing a macrohistorical version of the evolution of humankind. In Gud <8> , the classical form of science fiction itself, is challenged: A group of people are, by means of an alien vessel, heading towards the planet of God. With Den 33. marts <9> , the plot is altered from outer to \"inner space\", a platform resembling that of an American author of science fiction, Philip K. Dick. A person living in the 1970s Copenhagen discovers effects of society as mere stage equipment. Library books are empty and he is trapped within city borders. In a sanitarium, this person \"hallucinates\" about another world where he features as an awaited Messiah. Havet <10> is, like Anno Domini and Gud, a novel about space travel. The supernatural setting pivots around the cards of Tarok. In Menneske <11> , a computer independently achieves consciousness and decides to find out what existence as a human being is like. Consequently, it embarks on a Stone Age odyssey, following the history of man, ending in a parody of the 1970s of Denmark.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence.

Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was \"the kind of character you rarely see anymore  he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it\". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \"a very tricky structure\" for a feature film. A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as \"an L.A.-set action mystery\", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board. By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project. Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: \"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me  writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \"very strong character\" at its core, and a \"powerful\" romance. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said: I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft  maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. The actor chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, whose work he admired. He said, \"It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.\" When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate.

It paved the way for later megamusicals\u00a0\u2014 including Les Mis\u00e9rables , The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon \u2014 that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained: Cats introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting\u00a0\u2014 and then aggressively promoting\u00a0\u2014 a single recognisable image as the face of the show. The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline to create what The Daily Telegraph called \"one of musical theatre's greatest posters\". Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for Les Mis\u00e9rables and the Phantom's mask for The Phantom of the Opera. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called \"critic-proof\" status of megamusicals. Additionally, Cats was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official Cats t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry. Beyond the megamusical, Cats also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: \"Cats is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped.

Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to Cats, citing the latter's disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience. The musical's fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey's pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an \"architectural manner\", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of Cats was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre. Cats opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote: In the 1980s, the success of local productions of Cats in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit.

This is one of the reasons he agreed to the 2005 remake. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 75% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.6/10 based on 67 reviews.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock. It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock. Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues. Ireland's best selling musical act is the rock band U2, who have sold 170\u00a0million copies of their albums worldwide since their formation in 1976. There are a number of classical music ensembles around the country, such as the RT\u00c9 Performing Groups. Ireland also has two opera organisations: Irish National Opera in Dublin, and the annual Wexford Opera Festival, which promotes lesser-known operas, takes place during October and November. Ireland has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1965. Its first win was in 1970, when Dana won with All Kinds of Everything. It has subsequently won the competition six more times, the highest number of wins by any competing country. The phenomenon Riverdance originated as an interval performance during the 1994 contest. Irish dance can broadly be divided into social dance and performance dance. Irish social dance can be divided into c\u00e9il\u00ed and set dancing. Irish set dances are quadrilles, danced by 4 couples arranged in a square, while c\u00e9il\u00ed dances are danced by varied formations of couples of 2 to 16 people. There are also many stylistic differences between these two forms. Irish social dance is a living tradition, and variations in particular dances are found across the country. In some places dances are deliberately modified and new dances are choreographed. Performance dance is traditionally referred to as stepdance. Irish stepdance, popularised by the show Riverdance, is notable for its rapid leg movements, with the body and arms being kept largely stationary. The solo stepdance is generally characterised by a controlled but not rigid upper body, straight arms, and quick, precise movements of the feet. The solo dances can either be in \"soft shoe\" or \"hard shoe\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jon Pareles of The New York Times described him as \"a master architect of funk, rock, R&B and pop\", and highlighted his ability to defy labels. Los Angeles Times writer Randall Roberts called Prince \"among the most versatile and restlessly experimental pop artists of our time,\" writing that his \"early work connected disco and synthetic funk [while his] fruitful mid-period merged rock, soul, R&B and synth-pop.\" Simon Reynolds called him a \"pop polymath, flitting between funkadelia, acid rock, deep soul, schmaltz\u2014often within the same song\".

As a performer, he was known for his flamboyant style and showmanship. He came to be regarded as a sex symbol for his androgynous, amorphous sexuality, play with signifiers of gender, and defiance of racial stereotypes. His \"audacious, idiosyncratic\" fashion sense made use of \"ubiquitous purple, alluring makeup and frilled garments\". His androgynous look has been compared to those of Little Richard and David Bowie. In 2016, Reynolds described it as \"Prince's '80s evasion of conventional gender definitions speaks to us now in this trans-aware moment. But it also harks backwards in time to the origins of rock 'n' roll in racial mixture and sexual blurring\". Prince was known for the strong female presence in his bands and his support for women in the music industry throughout his career. Slate said he worked with an \"astounding range of female stars\" and \"promised a world where men and women looked and acted like each other\". Prince also wore high-heeled shoes and boots both on- and off-stage. Many artists have cited Prince as an influence and inspiration, including Beyonc\u00e9, Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Usher, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, The Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Lorde, Lenny Kravitz, Andr\u00e9 3000, Mark Speer, Jamie Lidell, Frank Ocean and Beck. Bono of U2 regarded Prince as one of his \"favorite composers of the twentieth century\". Beyonc\u00e9 expressed her admiration for Prince in the book Prince: A Private View, calling him \"my mentor\" and also praising his independence: \"He dared to fight for what was rightfully his: his freedom, wrapped up in words and music he created.\" In August 2017, Pantone Inc. introduced a new shade of purple in their color system in honor of Prince.

He wanted electronic music and to have it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out \"Under Your Spell\" and \"Tick of the Clock\" because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, \"A Real Hero\"'s keynote melody, about becoming \"a real human being, and a real hero\", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that \"Under Your Spell\" might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive \"in the exact same way that I was feeling it when I wrote it. He definitely got the nuance of the song, and understood what it was supposed to mean, and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling.\" Thinking of music in terms of basic elements, Jewel would tell the director that for certain scenes, it should not have bass since, as an earth tone, it is usually used for a more emotional or ominous part. Jewel thought the music should be in the upper register and relaxing for the \"dreamlike\" scene. To help himself with the music composition process, and to conjure up melodies, the producer would highlight many phrases from the novel, then print those words in large font, and hung them on his walls or draw pictures during viewings of Drive. Although Jewel's music was used in the score, at the last minute the studio hired composer Cliff Martinez to imitate the style and feel of Jewel's bands Chromatics and Glass Candy. Refn gave him a sampling of songs he liked and asked Martinez to emulate the sound, resulting in \"a kind of retro, 80ish, synthesizer europop\". Editor Mat Newman suggested Drives opening credits song: \"Nightcall\" by French electronic musician Kavinsky. Most of its ethereal electronic-pop score was composed by Martinez. Refn was a particular fan of his ambient music on the Sex, Lies, and Videotape soundtrack. The score contains tracks with vintage keyboards and bluntly descriptive titles. Jewel reworked his unused soundtrack for the film into Themes for an Imaginary Film, the debut album by his side-project Symmetry. A re-scored soundtrack for the film was produced for the BBC by Zane Lowe for its television broadcast in October 2014.

After the successes of the romantic Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and the historical epic Devdas \u2014one of the most expensive Hindi films ever made at the time\u2014he had made a plan to make another film in the romantic genre. Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\". Furthermore, he added, \"Black is about the love between a girl and her teacher. They teach each other the dignity of living. To call Black a love story is a true compliment.

Stokes said the song, both upon initial and repeated listens, \"seems transcendent, a magnificent synthesis of elements, words and music, rhythm, instrumentation arrangement and intonation combine to create something that speaks a language beyond logic, the definitive language of emotional truth\". He said the melody was reminiscent of Led Zeppelin and the vocals evoked memories of Al Green and the Rolling Stones circa \"Sympathy for the Devil\". Stokes could not single out what made the song so \"utterly inspirational\", but said it was \"soul music that avoids the obvious cliches of the genre and cuts to the core\". Q called Bono's singing on the song a \"quieter moment\" that has \"never been so persuasively tender\". The Chicago Tribune wrote that the song \"builds with the stately grandeur of a Roy Orbison ballad\" and that Bono's lyric \"We're one / But we're not the same\" is one of \"pithiest insights yet about the contradiction of marriage\".

Musical styles from different South American countries surface on the album. Tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance that originated in Argentina, is evident on \"Objection \", which also combines elements of rock and roll. The uptempo track features a guitar solo and a bridge in which Shakira delivers rap-like vocals. \"Whenever, Wherever\" blends pop rock with Andean music and contains instrumentation from panpipes and the charango - traditional instruments generally associated with the genre. A few songs are also influenced by dance-based genres; the \"feisty\" \"Rules\" is laced with new wave and \"Ready for the Good Times\" is inspired by disco music. The power ballad \"Underneath Your Clothes\" has Shakira delivering \"racked\" vocals and features brass instrumentation influenced by English rock band The Beatles. It contains a melody similar to the one in \"Eternal Flame\", a 1989 song by American all-female band The Bangles. Similarly, the tune of \"The One\", another power ballad on the album, is similar to that of \"Michelle\", a 1965 song by The Beatles. \"Fool\" and \"Poem to a Horse\" are more directly influenced by rock music. The former received comparisons to the work of Alanis Morissette while the latter also displays indie elements and contains instrumentation from a soul music-styled horn section and guitar riffs similar to the one present in songs by American grunge band Nirvana. Laundry Service also contains four Spanish tracks: \"Que Me Quedes T\u00fa\" , \"Te Dejo Madrid\" , \"Suerte\" and \"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio \" ; the latter two are Spanish translations of \"Whenever, Wherever\" and \"Objection \", respectively. The lyrics of most songs in Laundry Service are based on issues and themes related to love, as they had been written after Shakira began a relationship Antonio de la R\u00faa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la R\u00faa. \"Underneath Your Clothes\" is an \"ode\" to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an \"important side\" in \"The One\", which is a song about how \"you love your guy so much that you\u2019re actually going to learn to cook\" and contains lines like \"To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone.\" In \"Rules\", she aims to make her lover realise that he is \"condemned\" to her and lists \"all the things your new boy can do.\" Songs like \"Objection \" and \"Fool\" also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a \"hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train.\" In the song, Shakira asserts that \"Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible\", which a reviewer commented was a \"brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers .\" \"Fool\" discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a \"shitty, self-absorbed man\" even after suffering a \"soul-crushing defeat.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Donnie has repeatedly threatened Annie and her three children after Annie advised Valerie to leave him, accusing Annie of being a witch and telling her and her children that she will burn in hell. Valerie permits the search while Donnie is absent, but he returns while the search is proceeding. The police find Jessica's body in the pond and Donnie is arrested for her murder. Buddy Cole , a mentally ill acquaintance of Annie's, harbors a hatred for his father, and tries to explain to Annie why, but Annie is preoccupied and refuses to listen. That evening, Buddy's mother calls Annie to come to their house, as Buddy has snapped and has his father bound to a chair. Buddy sets his father on fire, and it is revealed that Buddy's father sexually abused him as a child. Buddy is arrested and taken to a mental hospital. During Donnie's trial for Jessica's murder, it is revealed that they had an affair. Donnie is convicted and sent to prison. Later, Annie receives more visions revealing that Donnie is innocent and that someone else wants to kill her. She asks prosecutor David Duncan to reopen the case. After Duncan declines, Annie counters that if he does not do so, she will reveal David and Jessica's affair, which she witnessed. Duncan attempts to bribe Annie in exchange for her silence, but Annie refuses. Annie tells Wayne that Donnie is not responsible for Jessica's death and that Duncan will not reopen the investigation. At Wayne's suggestion, he and Annie drive out to the pond at night, where Annie learns from a vision that Wayne is actually the murderer. Wayne confesses to Annie that he was angry after he discovered that Jessica was cheating on him with Donnie. Wayne attempts to kill Annie by striking her in the head with a flashlight, but Buddy appears and knocks him out. Annie and Buddy lock the unconscious Wayne in the trunk of Annie's car. Buddy tells Annie that he escaped from the mental hospital, and hands her a wash cloth to wipe her bloody head with. The two drive to the police station. Annie tells Buddy that he will have to return to the hospital, and he waits in the car while she enters the station. When she returns to the car with police, Buddy has disappeared. Annie explains to Johnson what happened at the pond, but he informs her that Buddy could not have aided her as he had died by suicide at the mental hospital earlier that day. Annie reaches in her pocket and pulls out the wash cloth Buddy gave her to wipe her head. Annie returns home and looks at photographs of her late husband Ben.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona , but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics.

{"id": "91_493", "question": "What genre is Johann Sebastian Bach?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_58318", "text": "Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He is known for his orchestral music such as the Brandenburg Concertos; instrumental compositions such as the Cello Suites; keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such as the Schubler Chorales and  the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and vocal music such as the St\u00a0Matthew Passion and the Mass in B\u00a0minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival, he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music. The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at the age of 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph, after which he continued his musical formation in L\u00fcneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and K\u00f6then, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65. Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and his sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ the genres of canon and fugue. Throughout the 18th century, Bach was primarily valued as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as The Well-Tempered Clavier, was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals exclusively devoted to him, and other publications such as the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including, the Air on the G String and \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", and of recordings, such as three different box sets with complete performances of the composer's oeuvre marking the 250th anniversary of his death.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Wired has an overall approval rating of 4% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 2.9/10. The site's critics' consensus states: \"A tasteless unintentional parody of the life it attempts to dramatize, Wired butchers John Belushi's memory with a misguided screenplay and unnecessary recreations of classic performances.\" Leonard Maltin condemned Wired as \"the film fiasco of its year\" and \"mind-numbingly wrongheaded.\" Maltin noted that Michael Chiklis \"looks a little like Belushi but conveys none of his comic genius in some clumsy Saturday Night Live recreations\" and that J. T. Walsh, \"as Woodward, is an unintentional howl with the decade's most constipated performance.\" Writing for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley dismissed the film as \"the silliest celebrity bio since Mommie Dearest\" and \"a biography without an ounce of soul or a shred of dignity. Billed as a fantasy-comedy-drama, it manages to be none of these. The drama is laughable, the comedy lame, the fantasy without wings.\" Kempley described the film's direction as \"ludicrous\", the script as \"preposterous\", and also criticized Michael Chiklis' portrayal of Belushi: \"Sam Kinison might have played the part -- like Belushi, he's obscene, overweight, abusive and mad as hell. Chiklis, who does look and sound like Belushi, is rather cherubic in his movie debut. There's a Bambi-ish quality to his portrait of debauchery, a strangely cute requiem for a funny man.\" Also writing for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wondered if the film is \"what the real Belushi's family, friends and fans really need. Certainly Belushi deserves as much scrutiny as the next public figure who died after heavy drug use, but this autopsy seems unnecessary.\" Howe had no praise for Michael Chiklis' performance as Belushi: \"Despite a histrionic outpouring of growls, snorts, yells and re-creations of familiar Belushi shticks, from Jake Elmore to Joe Cocker, Chiklis seems to miss every opportunity to redeem himself. He's loud where he should have been soft, flat where he should have been funny and dead where he should have been alive.\" Howe also noted that the film version of Woodward \"seems to have stumbled out of a Dragnet episode.\" Vincent Canby for The New York Times described the film as \"a bit fuzzy and off-center.\" Canby also noted that Chiklis \"seems to be doing the role a few years too soon. It's not only that he seems too young, but also that he simply hasn't any idea of what it's like to scrape the bottom of life's barrel.\" Canby did praise Patti D'Arbanville, \"who is exceptionally good as the addict who fatally ministers to Belushi in his last hours. She's a lost, sad character, more vivid than anyone else in the movie.\" Roger Hurlburt of the Sun-Sentinel also gave Wired a 1\u00bd-star rating, writing that \"we have director Larry Peerce thinking he's Frank Capra doing It's a Wonderful Life, or worse, Charles Dickens reworking A Christmas Carol... As a film that relies on mystical scenes to join together fact, plus appearing and disappearing characters scattered among confusing time sequences, Wired is a movie of overkill. The fact is, Belushi becomes more unlikable, more idiotic and more pathetically self-destructive as the film progresses.\" Caryn James for The New York Times began her Wired review with the words, \"There is almost no excuse for Wired, a film so devastatingly dull that it seems longer than John Belushi's whole career\", before adding \"audiences do not like their pop icons tampered with, and in biographical films such tampering is inevitable. Audiences bring to such films vivid images of people they feel they know, and they have consistently rejected films that fail to reflect that image... Any weeknight, viewers can turn on television reruns of the Saturday Night Live shows that made Belushi famous. And no matter how much Michael Chiklis, the star of Wired, resembles Belushi, his Killer Bee and his Joe Cocker imitation are no match for the highly visible, memorable, syndicated originals.\" Rolling Stone labeled the film \"a howling dog...Whether by design or by forced compromise, Wired is even more of a gloss than the candy-assed view of Jerry Lee Lewis in Great Balls of Fire!. Far from pointing any fingers, Wired the movie hardly names names...it appears that nearly everyone Belushi encountered in big, bad Hollywood tried to warn him off demon drugs. Wired packs all the investigative wallop of a Care Bears flick.\" The review also criticized Michael Chiklis for capturing \"none of Belushi's charm, warmth or genius. It's excruciating to watch Chiklis drain the wit from such classic Belushi routines as the Samurai, the Bees and the Blues Brothers.\" In 2008, writer Nathan Rabin posted a retrospective on Wired for his series \"My Year of Flops\" on The A.V. Club. Rabin wrote, \"To call Wired an unconscionable act of grave robbery/defilement would be an insult to the good name of grave-robbers everywhere. There are snuff films with more integrity...  Watching Wired, the two questions that pop up constantly are 'What the hell were they thinking?' followed by 'What the hell were they smoking, and where can I get some?'... I will give Rauch's screenplay this much: it sure is audacious... Rauch apparently set out to write a biopic as irreverent, wild, and unconventional as Belushi himself. The stakes were high. Had the filmmakers succeeded, they would have reinvented the biopic by injecting it with vast ocean of gallows humor, magic realism, and postmodern mindfuckery. The filmmakers took enormous chances, none of which paid off. They shot for the moon and fell flat on their asses. Richard Corliss, in his review of the film for Time Magazine, singled out Michael Chiklis's \"boldly percussive performance\", but described the film itself as a \"turkey, overstuffed as it is with mad ambitions and bad karma.\" In his review of Wired for the Houston Chronicle, Jeff Millar noted that Michael Chiklis \"looks reasonably enough like Belushi, and he impersonates him well enough to make us frustratingly aware that he is not John Belushi... In the sequences when he is asked to imitate Belushi the entertainer, he is desperately overmatched \u2013 any actor would be \u2013 against the close memory of a hugely idiosyncratic comic actor.\" Michael Wilmington for the Los Angeles Times praised the performances of Chiklis, D'Arbanville and Gary Groomes, but had mixed feelings about the film overall, noting that \"the crippling flaw in the film lies in its mix of surface daring and inner funk. Inside, it keeps flinching.\" Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \"Maybe there was no way to make a good movie out of this material, not yet, when everyone remembers Belushi and any actor who attempts to play him is sure to suffer by comparison.\" Awarding Wired 1\u00bd stars out of 4, Ebert noted that Wired \"is in some ways a sincere attempt to deal with the material, but it is such an ungainly and hapless movie, so stupidly written, so awkwardly directed and acted, that it never gets off the ground.\" In his syndicated movie review show Siskel & Ebert, Ebert did concede that Chiklis \"did what he could\" with his performance, while his partner Gene Siskel said that Chiklis and Groomes were very good and that the film could have been pulled off with better direction and a better script.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also authored a number of books on computer programming during the 1980s. In his earliest published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds up his own literary universe. The Dialog om det 21. \u00e5rhundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer, , is a philosophical dialogue modelled on the classical style of Galileo Galilei's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The plot is set in a not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new humanistic view on mankind and its new ideology , called Wulffianism. Wulffianism is anarchic in the word's real sense, entailing an acceptance of violence as a means and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy. Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned dialogues. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry is in rhyme, metrical with a touch of subtle pastiche. With the episodic novel Adam Harts Opdagelser <5> , Neutzsky-Wulff began to find his style and obtained henceforth crowds of fans. The book's protagonists are Adam Hart and his partner Victor Janis, both working as \"occult detectives\". An ironically rendered Neutzsky-Wulff himself also appears in a more secondary role. The series continues with the episodic Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen <6> Victor Janis og s\u00f8n <7> , both representing a more conventional novel structure, and ends with an experimental novel, Oiufael , mainly written in verse. An episode from Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen was adapted as the short film Adam Hart i Sahara , based on his own screenplay. Though sometimes he breaks the traditional conventions of the genre, Neutzsky-Wulff sees himself as an author of science fiction. He emphasizes the genre as the most prominent stage of artistic interpretations of the mythology of our time. Anno Domini tells the story of an astronaut on a strange planet, experiencing a macrohistorical version of the evolution of humankind. In Gud <8> , the classical form of science fiction itself, is challenged: A group of people are, by means of an alien vessel, heading towards the planet of God. With Den 33. marts <9> , the plot is altered from outer to \"inner space\", a platform resembling that of an American author of science fiction, Philip K. Dick. A person living in the 1970s Copenhagen discovers effects of society as mere stage equipment. Library books are empty and he is trapped within city borders. In a sanitarium, this person \"hallucinates\" about another world where he features as an awaited Messiah. Havet <10> is, like Anno Domini and Gud, a novel about space travel. The supernatural setting pivots around the cards of Tarok. In Menneske <11> , a computer independently achieves consciousness and decides to find out what existence as a human being is like. Consequently, it embarks on a Stone Age odyssey, following the history of man, ending in a parody of the 1970s of Denmark.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mack became friends while all three were working on individual small press projects. Bendis says that he also began to \"analyz[e] why it was that I [had] never attempted to write a superhero comic\" at the time, while he was writing crime books such as Jinx and Goldfish, despite his love of the genre. Concluding that Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen had sufficiently explored the genre, Bendis decided to work in other genres. The series' concept was derived from his love of crime fiction and police procedurals in general, as well as specific works such as Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, Janis Joplin's biography, Taxi Driver, T-Men, Traffic and Visions Of Light: The Art of Cinematography, and would take the form of a Behind the Music-type look at superheroes. Powers, Oeming says, is \"a superhero universe seen through the eyes of the police... [as] observed by the media\" and everyday individuals. Bendis' intention was to view the \"cliches of the superhero genre through the harder eyes of the cops\", but with the added layer that \"every arc has some footing in a famous rock star story\". Bendis' scripts are often compiled from \"a list of scenes\", eschewing \"the big exploding ending\" in favor of a \"character-driven or psychological ending\". Indeed, in experimenting with plots, the duo swiftly moved beyond 'mere' police procedurals , constantly pushing each other creatively in new ways. In conceiving plots for the series, Bendis emphasizes the purpose and themes in the narrative over \"just being cool\", and allowing the theme to dictate the direction of the story. Bendis would collaborate with Oeming, who had already expressed interest in producing a crime/noir comic with Bendis, inspired by his attempts to get work on Batman Adventures to do a book in a style reminiscent of Bruce Timm and Alex Toth. Bendis cites two images produced by Oeming as originating the then-experimental \"Powers' style\" and \"inspir[ing] everything in [Powers]\". Indeed, Bendis and Oeming's first collaboration was \"Mall Outing\" in Jinx: True Crime Confessions. It is included in Little Deaths \"for Powers completists and curiosity's sake\". Oeming has noted that, although seen as an overtly \"cartoony\" style, the artwork does not appeal to children, which helps sidestep the potential problem of the book, which contains mature content, being purchased by customers younger than its intended audience. Despite both creators only having produced work in black and white before Powers, Bendis envisioned Powers in color, and convinced Oeming that it could work, despite the dramatically higher number of sales required to sustain a color comic. Bendis also convinced Oeming that the book should juxtapose both the superhero and crime noir genres, as Oeming initially shied away from the former. Bendis writes in the 'Sketchbook' section of the Powers: Who Killed Retro Girl? TPB that \"one of the rules of film noir is that the city itself should be considered a lead character\". To this end, he made Oeming watch Visions of Light, a documentary by the American Cinematographers Institute about the art of lighting in film, which he saw as important to the feel of comics also. According to Oeming, both he and Bendis do copious research for their projects, and that before he began the series, he would do ride-alongs with police, meet police officials, and take extensive photo reference of their equipment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Marathon'''s mission is to travel to the Tau Ceti system and build a colony on its fourth planet. The player's character is an unnamed security officer assigned to the Marathon. The narrative is presented to the player using messages on computer terminals scattered throughout the game's levels. These messages include crew logs, historical documents, and other records, but principally include conversations that the player character has with three artificial intelligences that run UESC Marathon: Leela, Durandal, and Tycho. At the start of the game, the player character is aboard a shuttle returning from the colony to Marathon when an alien ship attacks the system. The officer makes his way to Marathon to find that the aliens used an electromagnetic pulse to disable much of the ship. Of the three AIs, only Leela is functional, and she guides the officer in a counter-strike against the aliens and to restore the other AIs and key systems. Leela learns that Durandal had been in contact with the aliens prior to their engagement with Marathon. The alien race, known as the S'pht, are being forced to fight by the Pfhor, an insectoid-like race. Leela soon discovers that Durandal had become \"rampant\" before the attack, and is able to think freely for himself. Leela aids the officer to disable Durandal's access to vital Marathon systems while sending a warning message to Earth, but in turn Durandal has the Pfhor send more forces to attack the Marathon, ultimately kidnapping the security officer. Leela intercedes to free the officer, but warns him that the S'pht attack has nearly destroyed her systems. The officer races to complete a bomb in the ship's engineering rooms, hoping it will force the Pfhor and S'pht to leave, but it is too late as Leela is \"killed\" by the S'pht, and Durandal takes over, forcing the officer to continue to follow his orders to stay alive. Durandal has the officer repair the ship's transporters, allowing him to go aboard the alien Pfhor vessel. Inside, while fighting off the Pfhor, the officer discovers a large cybernetic organism that the Pfhor use to control the S'pht. The officer destroys the organism, and guided by Durandal, the S'pht revolt against the Pfhor, first on their ship, and then aboard the Marathon. With most of the Pfhor threat gone, Durandal announces his intention to transfer himself to the Pfhor ship, which the S'pht have control of, and leave with them. As a parting gift, Durandal reveals that Leela was never fully destroyed, and the S'pht release their grasp on her before departing.

However, it is revealed that the man was actually murdered, with the supposed accident actually orchestrated by a group of killers led by the Brain . The group specialises in killing their victims using elaborate schemes that mask the murders as if they were accidents. Uncle , one of the team members, accidentally leaves a cigarette butt at the crime scene, and it is found by the Brain. After an argument, Uncle vows to quit smoking afterwards. The team then gets a job from a son that wants to kill his own father, likely for insurance money. They plan an accident to kill their target via electrocution, but the plan requires for it be to raining at a specific time. The team tries to execute their plan many times but fail due to the rain falling later than necessary. During one run, Uncle smokes a cigarette and begins to show signs of Alzheimer's disease, forgetting that he made a vow to stop smoking. However, the rain falls on time, and the team decides to go forth with their plan. Uncle forgets to play his part in the murder, but the murder is successfully executed nonetheless. Unexpectedly, after the murder, a bus loses control and almost runs over the Brain. The Brain manages to get out of the bus's path, but the bus then runs over Fatty , another member of the team, killing him on the scene. The Brain takes Fatty's belongings, with Fatty asking the Brain whether it really was an accident before he dies. The Brain then returns home to find police officers investigating his flat, which was broken into. The Brain becomes paranoid and is convinced that everything was a setup. He trails the son to an insurance company the next day. The Brain sees the son arguing with an insurance agent over what appears to be money, leading the Brain to suspect that the insurance agent was behind the bus accident. The Brain rents a flat on the floor directly below the insurance agent's flat, and begins to perform secret surveillance on the agent. One day, the Brain trails the client to find the Woman picking up the payment for the job at a parking garage. However, only Fatty and the Brain should have known about the pick-up. The Woman explains to the Brain that Fatty had told her about the client, but the Brain, suspecting her betrayal, kills her and takes the money. After he leaves, as he is walking on the sidewalk, the client falls from the roof of the same building and is dead. The Brain develops further suspicion of the insurance agent, who he can see talking on the phone and later hear him talking about the client on the phone in his flat. In a later date, the Brain receives a call from Uncle for help. However, the Brain is too late and finds Uncle severely injured, apparently dropping two stories from a building near the crime scene in the opening scene. The Brain decides to take revenge against the insurance agent and devises a scheme to kill the agent by reflecting the sun's rays to blind a car to run over the agent in what would appear to be an accident. However, in the middle of the plan's execution, there is a solar eclipse, blocking the sunlight. At this time, the Brain receives a call from Uncle in the hospital, who tells the Brain that Fatty's death really was an accident. Uncle had accidentally dropped a bag of toy balls that night, which led to the loss of control of the bus. Realizing he has made a mistake and that the agent is innocent, the Brain runs and tries to cover the windshield from reflecting light. The agent sees and recognises the Brain as he is running, but the Brain is too late, and a blinded driver runs over the agent's wife, killing her. On a later date, as the Brain is leaving the rented flat, he is confronted and stabbed by the insurance agent in the staircase, who asks the Brain why he had to harm them.

Although she often uses Lolita fashion\u2014a clothing style influenced by the Rococo style and the Victorian and Edwardian eras\u2014in her character designs as a way to convey the duality of her characters, she felt that the fashion failed to give the manga depth. She then centered the plots on the psychological aspects. As Mihara has expressed an interest in exploring the impact of the childhood environment on a person, especially his or her relationships with parents, the stories in Doll involve the eponymous androids and family life. Each short story contains an independent theme; \"A Maid Servant\", for example, takes its inspiration from a book about aging fears, and \"miseducation\" serves as the theme for a story about cram school, inspired by a book about the inadequacy of solely teaching theories. The overarching plot of Doll started with the second volume; she envisioned a prodigy burdened by \"parental pressure\" and a Doll to heal the psychological pain. She explained that while her flaws may appear in the human characters, her \"hopes for perfection\" may appear in the Dolls.

Clover has argued that the film, and its genre at large, links sexuality with danger, saying that killers in slasher films are fueled by a \"psychosexual fury\" and that all the killings are sexual in nature. She reinforces this idea by saying that \"guns have no place in slasher films\" and when examining the film I Spit on Your Grave she notes that \"a hands-on killing answers a hands-on rape in a way that a shooting, even a shooting preceded by a humiliation, does not.\" Equating sex with violence is important in Halloween and the slasher genre according to film scholar Pat Gill, who made a note of this in her essay \"The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, and the Family\". She remarks that Laurie's friends \"think of their babysitting jobs as opportunities to share drinks and beds with their boyfriends. One by one they are killed ... by Michael Myers an asylum escapee who years ago at the age of six murdered his sister for preferring sex to taking care of him.\" Carpenter has distanced himself from these interpretations, saying \"It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.\" In another interview, Carpenter said that readings of the film as a morality play \"completely missed the point,\" adding, \"The one girl who is the most sexually uptight just keeps stabbing this guy with a long knife. She's the most sexually frustrated. She's the one that's killed him. Not because she's a virgin but because all that sexually repressed energy starts coming out. She uses all those phallic symbols on the guy.\" Some feminist critics, according to historian Nicholas Rogers, \"have seen the slasher movies since Halloween as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hard-core pornography.\" Critics such as John Kenneth Muir state that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of \"any good planning\" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in Halloween and Halloween II only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers. However, Clover has argued that despite the violence against women, Halloween and other slasher films turned women into heroines. In many pre-Halloween horror films, women are depicted as helpless victims and are not safe until they are rescued by a strong masculine hero. Despite the fact that Loomis saves Strode, Clover asserts that Halloween initiates the role of the \"final girl\" who ultimately triumphs in the end. Strode fights back against Myers and severely wounds him. Had Myers been a normal man, Strode's attacks would have killed him; even Loomis, the male hero of the story, who shoots Michael repeatedly with a revolver, cannot kill him. Aviva Briefel argued that moments such as when Michael's face was temporarily revealed are meant to give pleasure to the male viewer. Briefel further argues that these moments are masochistic in nature and give pleasure to men because they are willingly submitting themselves to the women of the film; they submit themselves temporarily because it will make their return to authority even more powerful. Critics, such as Gill, see Halloween as a critique of American social values. She remarks that parental figures are almost entirely absent throughout the film, noting that when Laurie is attacked by Michael while babysitting, \"No parents, either of the teenagers or of the children left in their charge, call to check on their children or arrive to keen over them.\" According to Gill, the dangers of suburbia is another major theme that runs throughout the film and the slasher genre at large: Gill states that slasher films \"seem to mock white flight to gated communities, in particular the attempts of parents to shield their children from the dangerous influences represented by the city.\" Halloween and slasher films, generally, represent the underside of suburbia to Gill. Myers was raised in a suburban household and after he escapes the mental hospital he returns to his hometown to kill again; Myers is a product of the suburban environment, writes Gill. Michael is thought by some to represent evil in the film. This is based on the common belief that evil never dies, nor does evil show any remorse. This idea is demonstrated in the film when Dr. Loomis discusses Michael's history with the sheriff. Loomis states, \"I spent eight years trying to reach him [Michael Myers], and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply ... evil.\" Loomis also refers to Michael as \"evil\" when he steals his car at the sanitarium.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Chan has, in some ways, become a victim of his own excellence: the astonishing stunt work and action choreography of his peak years have set up expectations that no performer could continue to live up to, certainly not after moving into middle age. Viewers weaned on Chan's classics will undoubtedly find The Myth to be Jackie-lite, a slightly slowed-down version of his usual acrobatics. Yet the film does contain a few superb set pieces reminiscent of vintage Chan, and director Stanley Tong's opulent visual style makes it a feast for the eyes\u2014and the bottom line is that half-speed Jackie Chan is still more dynamic than just about any other action hero.\" Robert Koehler of Variety wrote a generally negative review of the film: \"Resembling a story session where many ideas are brainstormed and few stick, The Myth messily reps Jackie Chan in epic mode as a [contemporary] archaeologist drawn into a plot to plunder the treasure of the Qin Dynasty's first emperor. As part of a movement in H.K. cinema to return to the ambitious movies of yore, helmer Stanley Tong's multi-period adventure flirts with considerable entertainment on one hand and near self-destruction on the other. Whether Chan's star power will pull in enough international bizbiz is doubtful, though ancillary should flex muscles in most territories.\" David Nusair, writing for Reel Film Reviews from the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, was even less impressed:\"That The Myth eventually turns into an almost interminable experience is a shame, given the light-hearted and genuinely entertaining vibe of the film's opening hour...Fortunately, The Myth contains several expectedly impressive action sequences \u2013 with a fight set within a rat paper factory an obvious highlight \u2013 although it's not long before such moments wear out their welcome.

The show's sponsor, Sam Ipswich , discovered the orphan and made her a star in three months. He needs her public image to match her pure radio persona to promote Ippsie Wippsie, \"the washcloth of queens\". However, Glory longs to be a party girl, going to nightclubs, drinking, dancing, meeting men, and having a good time. All she can do is listen with envy to what her black maid Vera does in Harlem after work. Ipswich is anxious for her to sign a new contract, but she throws a tantrum and refuses because it explicitly prohibits all the things she wants to do. Along with everything else she has missed, she wants a sweetheart. Speed Dennis , Ipswich's press agent, considers this a great idea. He thinks the man should be \"Anglo-Saxon\" , and Herbert , Glory's dressmaker, insists that he should be under 25. Ipswich's secretary tells them that the \"purest Anglo-Saxons\" hail from the hills of Kentucky, so Glory picks a fan letter at random from those written by young Kentucky men and ends up with 23-year-old Jim Davey . She likes the enclosed photo of him. Ipswich, Speed and Herbert want her to choose someone else, but when \"sob sister\" reporter Elmerada de Leon comes to interview Glory, she spots the photo, so they have to play along. Speed goes to Kentucky and persuades the reluctant rural hick to accept a 10-day stay in New York. When he arrives, the press expects him to marry her, so Speed prompts the bashful Jim into romancing Glory. The wedding is conducted on-air. Kelsey assigns O'Connor to try to steal Glory away for his own radio program, sponsored by the Kelsey Dish Rag Company. O'Connor offers Jim help to slip away with Glory for a private honeymoon in Atlantic City, away from the press. Naive, Jim is stunned when he finds out that O'Connor is doing all this just to get Glory to sign with Kelsey and that the marriage is just a publicity stunt. At first, Jim insists that Glory wants to retire from show business and settle down, but when she learns the Kelsey contract has no restrictions on how she lives her life, she is eager to sign. Jim decides to take matters into his own hands, taking his wife home to rural Kentucky. At first, Glory is miffed, but the couple settle their differences . As they are settling into country life, Speed arrives, but he is unable to persuade Glory to return. He then has an idea: He gets Ipswich to let Vera sing as the Purity Girl that night. His plan backfires. Glory does become jealous, as he intended, but O'Connor is present, and she signs his contract. When the couple go to New York, Jim refuses to let his wife perform without him. Speed has hired him for Ippsie Wippsie as a poet. To solve the problem, the two sponsors join forces, merging their companies to form Ippsie-Kelsey Clothies,  and have the young couple perform together.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He lost the Duchy of Normandy and most of his other French lands to King Philip II of France, resulting in the collapse of the Angevin Empire and contributing to the subsequent growth in power of the French Capetian dynasty during the 13th century. The baronial revolt at the end of John's reign led to the sealing of , a document considered an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom. John was the youngest of the four surviving sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was nicknamed John Lackland because he was not expected to inherit significant lands. He became Henry's favourite child following the failed revolt of 1173\u20131174 by his brothers Henry the Young King, Richard, and Geoffrey against the King. John was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against the royal administrators of his brother, King Richard, whilst Richard was participating in the Third Crusade, but he was proclaimed king after Richard died in 1199. He came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200. When war with France broke out again in 1202, John achieved early victories, but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton, and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. He spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. His judicial reforms had a lasting effect on the English common law system, as well as providing an additional source of revenue. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute he finally settled in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed because of the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. When he returned to England, John faced a rebellion by many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and the barons agreed to the  peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, with the barons aided by Louis VIII of France. It soon descended into a stalemate. John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons the following year. Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been the subject of significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the current historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\". Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", such as pettiness, spitefulness, and cruelty. These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era, and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and originally published by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers in September 1984. Elites open-ended game model, and revolutionary 3D graphics led to it being ported to virtually every contemporary home computer system and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history. The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\". Elite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden-line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game Star Trader. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire. The Elite series is among the longest-running video game franchises. The first game was followed by the sequels Frontier: Elite II in 1993, and Frontier: First Encounters in 1995, which introduced Newtonian physics, realistic star systems and seamless freeform planetary landings. A third sequel, Elite Dangerous, began crowdfunding in 2012 and was launched on 16 December 2014, following a period of semi-open testing; it received a paid-for expansion season, Horizons, on 15 December 2015.

Development began immediately after Uchikoshi's first visual novel, Memories Off, was finished. He was unable to make heavy use of science fiction themes in Never 7, as his superiors at KID told him that the game needed to include cute girl characters in order to sell; he kept science fiction themes light, and the game was designed with a focus on dating game elements, with the main focus being to develop a relationship with a girl. The Dreamcast version includes new scenarios not available in the PlayStation version. The development team depicted reality in the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Cur\u00e9 syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as \"vague existences\", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which \"should be fictional\" remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die at some point during the game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what the answer would be. The game's soundtrack was composed by Takeshi Abo, and features \"geometric music\" because of the game's theoretical and science fiction elements. Prior to composing the music, he read through the game's story, to understand the setting and each character's personality as much as possible. He would write his impressions of the plot, with a focus on the \"emotional flow\" and the events that occur throughout the story; he valued his first impressions as very important for this. According to Abo, this method takes longer time, but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to the game's world than if he had just designated different songs to different points of the game. Because he enjoyed the story, the music strongly reflects Abo's own musical tastes. The opening and ending themes of the PlayStation Portable version, titled \"Sen Oku no Hoshikuzu Furasu Yoru no Sora\" and \"Hokorobishi Hana\", respectively, were performed by the band Asriel. The game was originally released by KID for PlayStation under the title Infinity on March 23, 2000. A Neo Geo Pocket version titled Infinity Cure was released on November 23, 2000, also by KID. On December 21, 2000, KID released a Dreamcast version titled Never 7: The End of Infinity; this version was also released for Microsoft Windows on October 26, 2001, and for PlayStation 2 on May 22, 2003.

The names of the two inside line backers are often called Sam and Mike and these two are lined up about four yards from the line of scrimmage and are lined up with the offensive guard. The inside line backers are often more of a run player so they will defend the run before they will the pass. These line backers will be reading the offensive guard so they know what to do, so if the guard sets up to pass block the line backers know to get into their zone in order to cover the pass. If the guard come out for a run play they know that they need to fill the gap that they are supposed to so that they can make a play if it comes to them. Also, these inside line backers are often called on a blitz which is when no matter what the offense does, as soon as that ball is snapped they are shooting their gap and trying to get into the back field to make a play as fast as possible. Outside line backers sometimes are considered to be pass players before they are run players. But that depends on where they are lined up, if they are outside of the box of the defense then they will be pass first players, but if they play inside the box lined up behind the defensive end then they are typically a run player.

In December that year, when the song was released onto iTunes on an EP, it peaked at No. 63 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but as the video drew popularity radio stations picked it up and started playing the track. The song was also featured on MuchMusic's 2012 MuchDance compilation CD. My Name Is Kay Kay released her first EP digitally on December 20, 2011. However, after her label suggested a name change, the EP was pulled from iTunes. On February 28, 2012, Kay re-released the EP, this time featuring different cover art, and a different track-listing than the first. This version was released physically in Canada. The EP featured guest vocals from rappers Kurtis Blow and Pusha T, as well as song writing credits from the likes of Ryan Tedder , Grammy award-winning songwriter Evan Bogart, Cherry Cherry Boom Boom, and producer Doctor Rosen Rosen. The first pressing of the EP featured a remix or the song \"M.A.J.O.R.\" from Ti\u00ebsto, but for unknown reasons this remix was not featured on the second pressing. \"M.A.J.O.R.\" was set to be released to serve as a promotional single for the EP, and a music video for the song was filmed in May 2010. However, the release was replaced with \"Diddy Dum\", and the music video has yet to be released. A music video for \"Diddy Dum\" was released on February 29, 2012, and the song was sent to selected radio stations in Canada as a promotional single. The song failed to chart; however, it received popularity after celebrity blogger Perez Hilton praised the song on his website, along with a link to the video. The second single from the EP was the track \"Strangers\", which featured guest vocals from American rapper Pusha T. Following its release on July 4, 2012, the song peaked at number 47 on the Canadian Hot 100. A music video for the song was filmed in Etobicoke, and was released on August 10, 2012. Kay does not consider \"My Name Is Kay\" or \"Strangers\" as singles, and always refers to them as \"songs\". Say What You Want On August 21, 2012, Kay released YouTube video, showing herself on a beach while the instrumental for a new song played. The video showed footage of Kay writing the words \"Rewind The Track\" in the sand, however it was shown in reverse. The video concluded with the messages \"KAY VS DOCTOR ROSEN ROSEN\" and \"September 2012\". The concluding message suggested that Kay would be releasing new material in September 2012, but no further detail was given. However, on October 3, 2012, Kay Tweeted more information about the release, saying it would be an EP entitled \"Say What You Want\", and that it would be released on November 13, 2012. To promote the album, Kay posted videos of a friend and herself interviewing the people that she was collaborating with on the EP. These videos were titled \"The Laina And Kay Show\". On November 6, 2012, Kay released a short film along with a new song called \"Rewind The Track\". The film received positive reviews, praising Kay's new direction, and the haunting sound of the song. The version of the song used in the video is slightly different, using less production than the album version. The EP was released on November 13, 2012, as promised, and has a notably darker sound than Kay's previous works, possible due to the fact that she dedicated it to \"anyone who's ever been betrayed.\" On the release date of \"Say What You Want\", Kay announced the EP was the first of five volumes she would be releasing in the next few months. On October 31, 2012, she also shot a music video for what she called her \"next single\", a song that was not featured on the EP called \"Whatever\". The four remaining EPs scheduled to be released were pieced apart in early 2013 for various releases throughout the year under Dim Mak, Mad Decent, Ultra Records and Last Gang Records, culminating on October 22, 2013 with the release of her debut full-length album 'My Name Is Kay'.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

After graduating high school, Bell headed to college where he met drummer Jody Abbott. Bell and Abbott formed a college campus band, Wanted , in Henderson, Tennessee. The band Wanted transitioned into Phoenix, which was a touring band for the college primarily used to recruit prospective students. After college, Bell and Abercrombie, who at the time was attending college at the University of Tennessee at Martin, reunited with Abbott and formed the band Reel Too Real, playing cover songs at local clubs in Tennessee and eventually becoming a national touring club circuit band. Bassist Jeff Abercrombie saw vocalist-guitarist Brett Scallions performing in a bar in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1992 and later recruited him to join in early 1993. Keyboardist Erik Avakian joined the group in 1995. During this time, Carl played guitar and provided backing vocals, Jeff played bass, Jody was on drums, Brett played guitar and sang lead vocals, and Erik played keyboards and shared singing duties on various songs. That same year, the band moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they performed at local Pennsylvania bars & nightclubs under the name Reel Too Real, playing cover songs. The band made a choice to perform under a different name when showcasing its own original material. That name, for the time being, would be Small the Joy, which produced one self-released EP, a self-titled cassette tape, in 1994. The band then once again decided to change its name, this time settling on the name Fuel, before self-releasing their second EP, Porcelain, in 1996 as well as repackaging their first EP, Small the Joy, with the \"Fuel\" name on it. There were several names on a shortlist, but in the end, Fuel was the name everyone agreed on. Erik played keyboards and sang backing vocals on both EPs before leaving the band in 1996. Porcelain sold well locally, spawning a small local radio hit with \"Shimmer\" even before being signed to a major label. The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their third EP, Hazleton, the following year, 1998. Mainstream success Upon signing to Epic, the band entered Longview Farm recording studios in Massachusetts, along with producer Steven Haigler and session drummer Jonathan Mover due to problems with Abbott. The band's full-length debut, Sunburn, came out in 1998. \"Shimmer\" was again included and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts, No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, No. 37 on the Adult Top 40 chart and at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the other singles received some airplay. The songs \"Shimmer\" and \"Sunburn\" are also featured on the charitable album Live in the X Lounge. \"Sunburn\" was also featured in the movie Scream 3, and the band contributed the non-LP track \"Walk the Sky\" to the 1998 American Godzilla film. The band hit the road in support of the release. Once again due to problems with Abbott, Mover was enlisted, this time to play drums on tour while the band sought out a full-time drummer to join. Kevin Miller joined the band as the drummer, coming from the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania-based bar band The Armadillos. Liner notes for the cassette and CD issues of \"Sunburn\" list the band members as Carl Bell , Brett Scallions , Jeff Abercrombie , and Kevin Miller , although Jonathan Mover is credited with playing all the drums and percussion on the record. The band picture includes Miller, though he did not play on the record. The album Sunburn was the band's first Gold and Platinum selling record. In 2000, Fuel returned with their second album, Something Like Human, featuring the single \"Hemorrhage \" which was No. 1 for 12 weeks on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single was also named Billboards No. 5 Rock Song of the Decade according to their Best of the 2000s Rock Songs chart. In 2013 \"Hemorrhage \" became the No. 6 Alternative Rock song of the past 25 years according to Billboards Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs. Something Like Human peaked at No.\u00a017 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA on September 25, 2001. The group's third album, Natural Selection, named after Darwinian theory, was released in September 2003 and debuted at No. 15 on the U.S. Billboard charts. The extended lag time between Something Like Human and Natural Selection was due to legal problems and lead singer Scallions having to recover from surgery to repair a deviated septum he suffered from an on-stage collision with Bell. The album spawned the hit \"Falls on Me\", which hit No. 9 and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and the Modern Rock Tracks charts, and reaching No. 13 and No. 17 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, peaking at No.\u00a052 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

Abercrombie and Bell took notice of American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry, after he performed \"Hemorrhage \" on the show. The single achieved the iTunes Top 10 download list, remaining a number of days and sparking interest in other Fuel songs, which began to appear in the iTunes Top 100 download chart. On March 3, 2006, American Idol judge, Randy Jackson, stated in an interview Daughtry had been offered the opportunity to become Fuel's new lead singer. Fuel confirmed their interest on their official website as well as interviews appearing on CNN Entertainment Tonight.

By this time also, Tommy Stewart, formerly of Godsmack, was named on Fuel's Myspace page as Fuel's drummer. On June 8, 2006, Bell announced the band had found a new lead singer but was awaiting confirmation from the record label to announce it. Still, they officially entered the studio in mid-August with producer Scott Humphrey to start recording their fourth album. Due to other commitments Stewart was not available to play drums on the album, so Tommy Lee and Josh Freese performed drums in his place.

The return of Brett Scallions and Puppet Strings On April 8, 2010, the reformation of Fuel was confirmed in an official press release. The band consisted of Scallions with an entirely new lineup. \"There is only one original of anything,\" says Scallions, \"and that includes Fuel. The original lineup with Carl, Jeff, Jody, and myself will always be something special to all of us, and our first Fuelies but it has been thirteen years since the original lineup was intact, and since then many great musicians have come and gone. The lineup I put together for Fuel is not meant to replace or diminish what any of the original members created. Just the opposite, it is to give our fans a live destination and to keep the Fuel name alive for a new generation to discover. Maybe someday we'll all get on the same page and play together again, but life happens, and the next thing you know you just can't jump on a bus and take off for a month, let alone a year.\" It was later announced on June 25, 2010, former Shinedown guitarist Jasin Todd had joined the band to replace Yogi Lonich on lead guitar. Lonich returned to the band in January 2011. Todd left the band on good terms. In March 2011, Brett Scallions started a new band called World Fire Brigade. The group was a writing team of Brett Scallions, Eddie Wohl, and Smile Empty Soul's Sean Danielsen. Scallions and Danielsen shared vocal duties, Danielsen played guitar parts, Scallions played bass, and Ken Schalk performed all drum tracks. Guest guitar solos were contributed by Rob Caggiano of Volbeat, Andy Andersson who played with Scallions in Fuel during the Puppet Strings era, and Mike McCready of Pearl Jam. The re-formed Fuel performed at The Bamboozle in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on May 1, 2011. The band played Bethlehem Musikfest alongside Buckcherry, however, Yogi Lonich was not on stage. A friend of Scallions, Martin Estrada, filled in for the show. Brett Scallions announced on his official Facebook page that Yogi Lonich and Scallions were parting ways amicably and it was best for Fuel to search for a replacement. Scallions also hinted there to be new music in the works and also introduced the band's new lead guitarist, Andy Andersson. The band continued its tour and played new material during their shows. Fuel entered the studio on March 8, 2012, to record their fifth full-length studio album, Puppet Strings. Eddie Wohl, co-producer of the World Fire Brigade album alongside Scallions and Danielsen, co-produced the new Fuel album with Scallions. In late September, the band re-entered the studio to complete the guitar and bass tracks for the record. As of February 2013, the band was still in the studio finishing vocal & guitar tracks. Originally planned for a 2012 release, the album had been pushed back to a possible mid-2013 release. This marked six years since the band released their previous album Angels & Devils. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the Billboard Rock charts, marking the band's first number one since Something Like Human. On April 30, 2013, drummer Ken Schalk announced his departure from the band to spend more time with his family. On that same day, Scallions announced new drummer Bryan \"Keelgood\" Keeling. The band, however, kept Schalk's drum tracks, as referenced by Keeling in his first interview since joining the band. On April 30, 2013, Brett Scallions announced a new Fuel single was targeted for a mid-summer release via download once the \"details have been worked out and handshakes have been made\". On June 26, 2013, Scallions announced that Bryan Keeling was going out on tour with Eric Sardinas in Europe and that Shannon Boone had joined the band. Scallions also commented on the new album; \"The record has been recorded and is so close to being released for all of you I can taste it. There will be big announcements very soon regarding release dates, singles, videos, and much much more. Take care and we will see you all soon at a venue near you!\" Scallions confirmed the new album was mixed by Ben Grosse who also collaborated with Fuel on Something Like Human. According to Scallions, the new album was currently in the mastering stage of production. It was announced through Guitar World on December 5, 2013, the album indeed titled, Puppet Strings, would be released on March 4, 2014. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the rock charts, the band's first number one since Something Like Human. The song, \"Yeah!\", was released for free download on the website as well, although it was believed to be the first single, Scallions stated it is not the first single but rather a \"teaser\". The first single, \"Soul to Preach To\" was released in late January 2014. In May 2015, as Fuel geared up to join Everclear on their Summerland Tour, ex-Filter bass player Phil Buckman temporarily replaced Brad Stewart, with Stewart himself filling in for the band Saliva. Although Brad stated he was scheduled to re-join Fuel on June 9, the temporary switch proved to be permanent with Stewart continuing his new role in Saliva, as did Buckman with Fuel. Scallions made many posts on Facebook and Instagram of him working in the studio on new material. It was later announced it was to be released as solo material. The band toured the US in August and September 2017 and toured Australia and New Zealand in December 2017. Fuel toured throughout 2018, playing Sunburn in its entirety to commemorate its 20th anniversary. On October 21, 2020, Scallions officially announced his departure from Fuel in a Facebook post : Bell's return and new record Anomaly Sometime in 2020, founding member and primary songwriter Carl Bell decided to return to the band, forming a new version of group. According to Bell, this was more or less a rebirth of Fuel and a new era for the band. Bell reunited with former drummer Kevin Miller to reform the group. Together they recruited a new singer, John Corsale, who at the time was the frontman for Miller's band Smashed. They began rehearsing in summer of 2020, and later began working on what would become Fuel's 6th full-length album. During that time, the band also released Something Like Human on vinyl for the first time. Fuel's newest album, Anomaly, was released on October 22, 2021.  Basically due to travel restrictions from Covid and the inability for the band to get together, Bell wrote all the songs on Anomaly, performed all the instruments on the album, recorded, arranged, produced and mixed the album.  The first single, \"Hard\", was released on July 9. The album's second single, \"Don't Say I\", was released on August 20, 2021. The album's 11 songs were written and performed by Bell with vocals by Corsale. Miller, along with new members Mark Klotz and Tommy Nat do not perform on the album but are featured in the videos and live performances. The cover art and track listing was revealed on August 28. Since the album's release, the band has been performing various shows live in the US, and has more shows and some major festival dates scheduled for 2022.  Scheduled 2022 festivals include dates with KISS, Five Finger Death Punch, Papa Roach, Seether, Bush, Puddle of Mud, Mammoth WVH, Bad Wolves and many others.  The band is also scheduled to release new material in addition to the Anomaly release.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". \"Mothership\" essentially means \"Main series\", where as \"Escort\" essentially means \"Spinoff\". One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions. There are also terms that are used in remakes or ports of games: \"R\" stands for \"remake\" or \"Re-imagination\" , while \"F\" in Graces f stood for \"future\", in reference to the game's extra story content.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided to be happy with the results.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Xenogears Original Soundtrack was released on two discs and published by DigiCube in Japan in 1998. The score contains 41 instrumental tracks, in addition to a choral track and two songs. According to Mitsuda, the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from \"a world of [his] own imagining\" rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. There are two vocal tracks included on the OST, and both are sung by Joanne Hogg. One of the tracks, \"Stars of Tears\", did not appear in the final version of the game. It was originally intended to play in a cut scene at the start of the game along with the main staff credits. The scene, however, was removed for pacing issues, as it would have made the combined opening movie and introduction scenes last roughly ten minutes. The other, \"Small Two of Pieces ~Screeching Shards~\", was the first ending theme with lyrics to ever appear in a game developed by Square. An arranged soundtrack of Xenogears composed and arranged by Mitsuda was released as Creid. For Creid, he expanded on the theme from the original album of having Celtic influences in \"easy-to-listen-to\" pop tracks to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style. The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces. The album features five vocal tracks and five instrumental tracks. The main lyricist, Junko Kudo, wrote the lyrics to four of the five vocal tracks, while Mitsuda wrote the lyrics to the title track, which were then translated from Japanese to Gaelic for the recording. Celtic singer Joanne Hogg did not reprise her role in Creid. Instead, Tetsuko Honma sang the four tracks written by Kudo, while Eimear Quinn sang \"Creid\". Myth: The Xenogears Orchestral Album, an album of music from the game arranged orchestrally by Mitsuda's own music company Procyon Studio, was released on CD and vinyl in February 2011. A Blu-ray album entitled Xenogears Original Soundtrack Revival Disc - the first and the last - was released in Japan on April 4, 2018.

He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in Protestant mystical allegory. Even though the poem was written during the Napoleonic Wars, Blake was an outspoken supporter of the French Revolution, and Napoleon claimed to be continuing this revolution. The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. In 1803 Blake was charged at Chichester with high treason for having \"uttered seditious and treasonable expressions\", but was acquitted. The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from Numbers ch. 11, v. 29: \"Would to God that all the Lords people were prophets.\" Christopher Rowland has argued that this includes everyone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an \"honest persuasion\" that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful.\" The words of the poem \"stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society 'in Englands green and pleasant land.'\u2009\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He explains the rule of the game is to stay alive, and after Yar refuses to compete, he transports her back to the bridge of the Enterprise in a \"penalty box\". Q returns to the bridge too, to talk Picard into setting a wager. He explains that the Q Continuum is testing Commander Riker to see if he is worthy of being granted their powers. Picard, having the utmost faith in his First Officer, takes the bet, as winning it would mean Q would get off their backs.  Meanwhile, Riker and his team are attacked by what Lt. Worf reports as \"vicious animal things\" wearing French soldier's uniforms from the Napoleonic era and armed with muskets that fire energy bolts instead of the classic projectiles. Q returns to Riker and tells him that he has granted him the powers of the Continuum, and Riker promptly returns his crew mates to the ship but remains behind with Q to ultimately reject the powers. Q brings the crew back to the landscape, this time without their phasers and with Picard. The crew are attacked once more by the aliens, and both Worf and Wesley Crusher are killed. Riker uses the powers of the Q to return the crew again and bring both Worf and Wesley back to life. Riker makes a promise to Picard never to use the powers again and the ship arrives at Quadra Sigma. A rescue team beams down and discovers a young girl who has died. Riker is tempted to save her, but in the end he refuses to do so out of respect for his promise; however, he quickly shows signs of regret at this decision, which he expresses to the captain.

The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind and Daphne Honeybutt . One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File was released in 1965. The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin , the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn , while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films. Following the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond\u00a0... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere. The 24 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 26 Bond films have grossed over $7.04\u00a0billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\". Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart. Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady.

Ian Martin from AllMusic awarded the album 3.5 stars out of five. Martin felt the production was \"overwhelming\" by commenting \"There are also a number of occasions where the production completely overwhelms the sometimes flimsy melodies on offer, and it's hard to escape the impression that producer Yasutaka Nakata's attitude to the three members' vocal contributions is basically one of damage limitation.\" He did, however, commend the album's catchiness and complimented the mixture of dance genres. Zac Bentz from Japanator.com gave the album a mixed review. He criticized the album's lack of development and personality and felt the album didn't have a diversity of musical genres outside of electronic dance music. He commented, \"If Perfume doesn't start expanding their sound, maybe moving out of the cyber-dance cage Yasutaka has built up around them into, say, more real-world territory, their remaining time may be limited.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_562", "question": "What genre is The Driver?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_75566", "text": "The novel Drive by James Sallis was published in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was \"the kind of character you rarely see anymore  he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it\". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \"a very tricky structure\" for a feature film. A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as \"an L.A.-set action mystery\", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board. By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project. Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: \"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me  writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \"very strong character\" at its core, and a \"powerful\" romance. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said: I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft  maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. The actor chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, whose work he admired. He said, \"It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.\" When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The flora, fauna and customs of Gor are intricately detailed. Norman populates his planet with the equivalents of Roman, Greek, Native American, Viking, Inuit and other cultures. In the novels, these various population groups are transplants from Earth brought there by spacecraft through the behind-the-scenes rulers of Gor, the Priest-Kings, an extraterrestrial species of insectoid appearance. The Gorean humans are permitted advanced architectural, agricultural and medical skills , but are forced to remain primitive in the fields of transportation, communication and weaponry due to restrictions on technology imposed by the Priest-Kings. The most advanced form of transportation is the riding of large predatory birds called tarns by masterful men known as tarnsmen. The limitation of technology is imposed to ensure the safety of both the Priest-Kings and the other indigenous and transplanted beings on Gor, who would otherwise possibly come to harm due to the humans' belligerent tendencies. The planet Gor has lower gravity than the Earth and would have an even lower gravity if not for the technology of the Priest-Kings. The known geography of Gor consists mainly of the western seaboard of a continent that runs from the Arctic in the north to south of the equator, with the Thassa ocean to the west, and the Voltai mountain range forming an eastern boundary at many latitudes. There are also offshore islands in the ocean and some relatively sparsely settled plains to the east of the Voltai. The word \"Gor\" itself means \"home stone\" in the Gorean language, the native language of the \"northern civilized cities of known Gor\" , and a widely spoken lingua franca in many other areas.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". \"Mothership\" essentially means \"Main series\", where as \"Escort\" essentially means \"Spinoff\". One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

{"id": "91_569", "question": "What genre is Another?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_47215", "text": "Glas is described as experimental and obscure. Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

A full-length novel featuring him, The Moving Target, followed in 1949 and was the first in a series of eighteen. Macdonald mentions in the foreword to the Archer in Hollywood omnibus that his detective derives his name from Sam Spade's partner, Miles Archer, and from LewWallace, author of Ben-Hur, though the character was patterned on Philip Marlowe. Macdonald also stated the surname \"Archer\" was inspired by his own astrological sign of Sagittarius the archer. The novels were hailed by genre fans and literary critics alike. The Lew Archer novels are recognized as some of the most significant American mystery books of the mid 20th century, bringing a literary sophistication to the genre. The critic John Leonard declared that Macdonald had surpassed the limits of crime fiction to become \"a major American novelist\". He has also been called the primary heir to Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler as the master of American hardboiled mysteries. Macdonald's writing built on the pithy style of his predecessors by adding psychological depth and insights into the motivations of his characters. Their plots of \"baroque splendor\" were complicated and often turned on Archer's unearthing family secrets of upwardly mobile clients, sometimes going back over several generations. Lost or wayward sons and daughters were a theme common to many of the novels. Critics have commented favorably on Macdonald's deft combination of the two sides of the mystery genre, the \"whodunit\" and the psychological thriller. Even his regular readers seldom saw a Macdonald denouement coming. Screenwriter William Goldman, who adapted Macdonald's stories to film, called his works \"the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American\". Paul Newman played the lead role in two of the movies from the books which used the titles Harper and The Drowning Pool while Peter Graves starred in the TV movie The Underground Man. Tom Nolan in his Ross Macdonald, A Biography, wrote, \"By any standard he was remarkable. His first books, patterned on Hammett and Chandler, were at once vivid chronicles of a postwar California and elaborate retellings of Greek and other classic myths. Gradually he swapped the hard-boiled trappings for more subjective themes: personal identity, the family secret, the family scapegoat, the childhood trauma; how men and women need and battle each other, how the buried past rises like a skeleton to confront the present. He brought the tragic drama of Freud and the psychology of Sophocles to detective stories, and his prose flashed with poetic imagery.\" In a 2017 book review, the Wall Street Journal provided this summary of the author's style:\"... it is the sheer beauty of Macdonald\u2019s laconic style\u2014with its seductive rhythms and elegant plainness\u2014that holds us spellbound. 'Hard-boiled,' 'noir,' 'mystery,' it doesn\u2019t matter what you call it. Macdonald, with insolent grace, blows past the barrier constructed by Dorothy Sayers between \u201cthe literature of escape\u201d and \u201cthe literature of expression.\u201d These novels, triumphs of his literary alchemy, dare to be both.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Retro Gamer cited Hang-On as the first example of a full-body experience game because of the deluxe cabinet's ride-on controls, and noted the game as being popular, though less impressive than Out Run. Hang-On started the trend of \"taikan\" motion simulator games in arcades during the mid-to-late 1980s, with \"taikan\" meaning \"body sensation\" in Japanese. Sega followed it with hydraulic motion simulator cabinets for rail shooters such as Space Harrier , racing games such as  Out Run , and combat flight simulators such as After Burner . Sega have since continued to manufacture motion simulator cabinets for arcade games through to the 2010s.

A September 2006 community theater production at the 2,000-seat Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, was praised by original producer Michael Butler, who said it was \"one of the best Hairs I have seen in a long time.\"  Another example of a recent large-scale amateur production is the Mountain Play production at the 4,000-seat Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre in Mount Tamalpais State Park in Mill Valley, California, in the spring of 2007. Legacy Hair was Broadway's \"first fully realized\" concept musical, a form that dominated the musical theatre of the seventies, including shows like Company, Follies, Pacific Overtures and A Chorus Line. While the development of the concept musical was an unexpected consequence of Hair tenure on Broadway, the expected rock music revolution on Broadway turned out to be less than complete. MacDermot followed Hair with three successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona ; Dude , a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica . While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteen\u00a0performances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. According to Horn, these and other such \"failures may have been the result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard to the quality of the material presented\". Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell were two religiously themed successes of the genre. Grease reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz were heavily influenced by gospel, R&B and soul music. By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls and Little Shop of Horrors , audience tastes in the 1980s turned to megamusicals with pop scores, like Les Mis\u00e9rables and The Phantom of the Opera . Some later rock musicals, such as Rent and Spring Awakening , as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You and Rock of Ages , have found success. But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. Critic Clive Barnes commented, \"There really weren't any rock musicals. No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ...  You might think of the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why. There's so much more money in records and rock concerts. I mean, why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia?\"Subsequent to Barnes' comment, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark began performances in 2010, with a rock score by Bono, but the musical suffered a series of mishaps, record expenses and tepid reviews. See, e.g., Pennacchio, George. \"Spider-Man musical opens: What critics said\". . ABClocal-KABC, June 14, 2011. On the other hand, Hair had a profound effect not only on what was acceptable on Broadway, but as part of the very social movements that it celebrated. For example, in 1970, Butler, Castelli and the various Hair casts contributed to fundraising for the World Youth Assembly, a United Nations\u2013sponsored organization formed in connection with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the United Nations. The Assembly enabled 750 young representatives from around the world to meet in New York in July 1970 to discuss social issues.\"Racusin Keys Trade Youth Drive of UN\". . Billboard, June 6, 1970, accessed April 19, 2011 For about a week, cast members worldwide collected donations at every show for the fund.  Hair raised around $250,000 and ended up being the principal financier of the Assembly. Cast and crew members also contributed a day's pay, and Butler contributed a day's profits from these productions. Moreover, as Ellen Stewart, La MaMa's founder, noted:", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_579", "question": "What genre is Fuel?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_22853", "text": "Early years What would become Fuel was formed in 1989 in the western Tennessee town of Kenton when childhood friends Carl Bell and Jeff Abercrombie began playing music together in junior high school and played in various garage bands. After graduating high school, Bell headed to college where he met drummer Jody Abbott. Bell and Abbott formed a college campus band, Wanted , in Henderson, Tennessee. The band Wanted transitioned into Phoenix, which was a touring band for the college primarily used to recruit prospective students. After college, Bell and Abercrombie, who at the time was attending college at the University of Tennessee at Martin, reunited with Abbott and formed the band Reel Too Real, playing cover songs at local clubs in Tennessee and eventually becoming a national touring club circuit band. Bassist Jeff Abercrombie saw vocalist-guitarist Brett Scallions performing in a bar in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1992 and later recruited him to join in early 1993. Keyboardist Erik Avakian joined the group in 1995. During this time, Carl played guitar and provided backing vocals, Jeff played bass, Jody was on drums, Brett played guitar and sang lead vocals, and Erik played keyboards and shared singing duties on various songs. That same year, the band moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they performed at local Pennsylvania bars & nightclubs under the name Reel Too Real, playing cover songs. The band made a choice to perform under a different name when showcasing its own original material. That name, for the time being, would be Small the Joy, which produced one self-released EP, a self-titled cassette tape, in 1994. The band then once again decided to change its name, this time settling on the name Fuel, before self-releasing their second EP, Porcelain, in 1996 as well as repackaging their first EP, Small the Joy, with the \"Fuel\" name on it. There were several names on a shortlist, but in the end, Fuel was the name everyone agreed on. Erik played keyboards and sang backing vocals on both EPs before leaving the band in 1996. Porcelain sold well locally, spawning a small local radio hit with \"Shimmer\" even before being signed to a major label. The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their third EP, Hazleton, the following year, 1998. Mainstream success Upon signing to Epic, the band entered Longview Farm recording studios in Massachusetts, along with producer Steven Haigler and session drummer Jonathan Mover due to problems with Abbott. The band's full-length debut, Sunburn, came out in 1998. \"Shimmer\" was again included and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts, No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, No. 37 on the Adult Top 40 chart and at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the other singles received some airplay. The songs \"Shimmer\" and \"Sunburn\" are also featured on the charitable album Live in the X Lounge. \"Sunburn\" was also featured in the movie Scream 3, and the band contributed the non-LP track \"Walk the Sky\" to the 1998 American Godzilla film. The band hit the road in support of the release. Once again due to problems with Abbott, Mover was enlisted, this time to play drums on tour while the band sought out a full-time drummer to join. Kevin Miller joined the band as the drummer, coming from the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania-based bar band The Armadillos. Liner notes for the cassette and CD issues of \"Sunburn\" list the band members as Carl Bell , Brett Scallions , Jeff Abercrombie , and Kevin Miller , although Jonathan Mover is credited with playing all the drums and percussion on the record. The band picture includes Miller, though he did not play on the record. The album Sunburn was the band's first Gold and Platinum selling record. In 2000, Fuel returned with their second album, Something Like Human, featuring the single \"Hemorrhage \" which was No. 1 for 12 weeks on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single was also named Billboards No. 5 Rock Song of the Decade according to their Best of the 2000s Rock Songs chart. In 2013 \"Hemorrhage \" became the No. 6 Alternative Rock song of the past 25 years according to Billboards Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs. Something Like Human peaked at No.\u00a017 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA on September 25, 2001. The group's third album, Natural Selection, named after Darwinian theory, was released in September 2003 and debuted at No. 15 on the U.S. Billboard charts. The extended lag time between Something Like Human and Natural Selection was due to legal problems and lead singer Scallions having to recover from surgery to repair a deviated septum he suffered from an on-stage collision with Bell. The album spawned the hit \"Falls on Me\", which hit No. 9 and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and the Modern Rock Tracks charts, and reaching No. 13 and No. 17 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, peaking at No.\u00a052 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004 for best engineered album, and the band contributed the song \"Won't Back Down\" to the Daredevil soundtrack earlier in the year. They released their greatest hits album The Best of Fuel on December 13, 2005. Their song \"Quarter\" was featured in the games Need for Speed: Underground, NFL Street, and NASCAR Thunder 2004. Line-up changes and Angels & Devils After disagreements , drummer Kevin Miller was dismissed from the band in 2004. On February 7, 2006, Fuel announced through their website singer Brett Scallions had left the band. Fuel had already laid the instrumental tracks for their fourth album and soon began auditioning singers so the band could move forward. Abercrombie and Bell took notice of American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry, after he performed \"Hemorrhage \" on the show. The single achieved the iTunes Top 10 download list, remaining a number of days and sparking interest in other Fuel songs, which began to appear in the iTunes Top 100 download chart. On March 3, 2006, American Idol judge, Randy Jackson, stated in an interview Daughtry had been offered the opportunity to become Fuel's new lead singer. Fuel confirmed their interest on their official website as well as interviews appearing on CNN Entertainment Tonight. On May 11, 2006, Abercrombie and Bell appeared on the TV show Extra to officially offer Daughtry the job. However, though flattered, Daughtry turned down this offer. By this time also, Tommy Stewart, formerly of Godsmack, was named on Fuel's Myspace page as Fuel's drummer. On June 8, 2006, Bell announced the band had found a new lead singer but was awaiting confirmation from the record label to announce it. Still, they officially entered the studio in mid-August with producer Scott Humphrey to start recording their fourth album. Due to other commitments Stewart was not available to play drums on the album, so Tommy Lee and Josh Freese performed drums in his place. The band posted photos from the studio fairly often on the band's website and MySpace. On March 9, 2007, Carl Bell officially announced Fuel's next album, complete with new band members, was fully mixed and going to mastering, and on April 19, 2007, he posted on Fuel's official website their new lead singer was Toryn Green. On May 15, 2007, Bell announced the title of the new album\u2014Angels & Devils. On June 19, 2007, Fuel's first single from their new album, \"Wasted Time\", was released into rock radio and internet download, peaking at No. 24 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. The album was released on August 7, 2007. A second single, \"Gone\", was released on October 23. Angels & Devils debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 42, selling roughly 15,000 copies in its first week. On October 20, 2008, Sony's catalog division Legacy Recordings released the album Playlist: The Very Best of Fuel on their Playlist series. The return of Brett Scallions and Puppet Strings On April 8, 2010, the reformation of Fuel was confirmed in an official press release. The band consisted of Scallions with an entirely new lineup. \"There is only one original of anything,\" says Scallions, \"and that includes Fuel. The original lineup with Carl, Jeff, Jody, and myself will always be something special to all of us, and our first Fuelies but it has been thirteen years since the original lineup was intact, and since then many great musicians have come and gone. The lineup I put together for Fuel is not meant to replace or diminish what any of the original members created. Just the opposite, it is to give our fans a live destination and to keep the Fuel name alive for a new generation to discover. Maybe someday we'll all get on the same page and play together again, but life happens, and the next thing you know you just can't jump on a bus and take off for a month, let alone a year.\" It was later announced on June 25, 2010, former Shinedown guitarist Jasin Todd had joined the band to replace Yogi Lonich on lead guitar. Lonich returned to the band in January 2011. Todd left the band on good terms. In March 2011, Brett Scallions started a new band called World Fire Brigade. The group was a writing team of Brett Scallions, Eddie Wohl, and Smile Empty Soul's Sean Danielsen. Scallions and Danielsen shared vocal duties, Danielsen played guitar parts, Scallions played bass, and Ken Schalk performed all drum tracks. Guest guitar solos were contributed by Rob Caggiano of Volbeat, Andy Andersson who played with Scallions in Fuel during the Puppet Strings era, and Mike McCready of Pearl Jam. The re-formed Fuel performed at The Bamboozle in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on May 1, 2011. The band played Bethlehem Musikfest alongside Buckcherry, however, Yogi Lonich was not on stage. A friend of Scallions, Martin Estrada, filled in for the show. Brett Scallions announced on his official Facebook page that Yogi Lonich and Scallions were parting ways amicably and it was best for Fuel to search for a replacement. Scallions also hinted there to be new music in the works and also introduced the band's new lead guitarist, Andy Andersson. The band continued its tour and played new material during their shows. Fuel entered the studio on March 8, 2012, to record their fifth full-length studio album, Puppet Strings. Eddie Wohl, co-producer of the World Fire Brigade album alongside Scallions and Danielsen, co-produced the new Fuel album with Scallions. In late September, the band re-entered the studio to complete the guitar and bass tracks for the record. As of February 2013, the band was still in the studio finishing vocal & guitar tracks. Originally planned for a 2012 release, the album had been pushed back to a possible mid-2013 release. This marked six years since the band released their previous album Angels & Devils. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the Billboard Rock charts, marking the band's first number one since Something Like Human. On April 30, 2013, drummer Ken Schalk announced his departure from the band to spend more time with his family. On that same day, Scallions announced new drummer Bryan \"Keelgood\" Keeling. The band, however, kept Schalk's drum tracks, as referenced by Keeling in his first interview since joining the band. On April 30, 2013, Brett Scallions announced a new Fuel single was targeted for a mid-summer release via download once the \"details have been worked out and handshakes have been made\". On June 26, 2013, Scallions announced that Bryan Keeling was going out on tour with Eric Sardinas in Europe and that Shannon Boone had joined the band. Scallions also commented on the new album; \"The record has been recorded and is so close to being released for all of you I can taste it. There will be big announcements very soon regarding release dates, singles, videos, and much much more. Take care and we will see you all soon at a venue near you!\" Scallions confirmed the new album was mixed by Ben Grosse who also collaborated with Fuel on Something Like Human. According to Scallions, the new album was currently in the mastering stage of production. It was announced through Guitar World on December 5, 2013, the album indeed titled, Puppet Strings, would be released on March 4, 2014. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the rock charts, the band's first number one since Something Like Human. The song, \"Yeah!\", was released for free download on the website as well, although it was believed to be the first single, Scallions stated it is not the first single but rather a \"teaser\". The first single, \"Soul to Preach To\" was released in late January 2014. In May 2015, as Fuel geared up to join Everclear on their Summerland Tour, ex-Filter bass player Phil Buckman temporarily replaced Brad Stewart, with Stewart himself filling in for the band Saliva. Although Brad stated he was scheduled to re-join Fuel on June 9, the temporary switch proved to be permanent with Stewart continuing his new role in Saliva, as did Buckman with Fuel. Scallions made many posts on Facebook and Instagram of him working in the studio on new material. It was later announced it was to be released as solo material. The band toured the US in August and September 2017 and toured Australia and New Zealand in December 2017. Fuel toured throughout 2018, playing Sunburn in its entirety to commemorate its 20th anniversary. On October 21, 2020, Scallions officially announced his departure from Fuel in a Facebook post : Bell's return and new record Anomaly Sometime in 2020, founding member and primary songwriter Carl Bell decided to return to the band, forming a new version of group. According to Bell, this was more or less a rebirth of Fuel and a new era for the band. Bell reunited with former drummer Kevin Miller to reform the group. Together they recruited a new singer, John Corsale, who at the time was the frontman for Miller's band Smashed. They began rehearsing in summer of 2020, and later began working on what would become Fuel's 6th full-length album. During that time, the band also released Something Like Human on vinyl for the first time. Fuel's newest album, Anomaly, was released on October 22, 2021.  Basically due to travel restrictions from Covid and the inability for the band to get together, Bell wrote all the songs on Anomaly, performed all the instruments on the album, recorded, arranged, produced and mixed the album.  The first single, \"Hard\", was released on July 9. The album's second single, \"Don't Say I\", was released on August 20, 2021. The album's 11 songs were written and performed by Bell with vocals by Corsale. Miller, along with new members Mark Klotz and Tommy Nat do not perform on the album but are featured in the videos and live performances. The cover art and track listing was revealed on August 28. Since the album's release, the band has been performing various shows live in the US, and has more shows and some major festival dates scheduled for 2022.  Scheduled 2022 festivals include dates with KISS, Five Finger Death Punch, Papa Roach, Seether, Bush, Puddle of Mud, Mammoth WVH, Bad Wolves and many others.  The band is also scheduled to release new material in addition to the Anomaly release.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_581", "question": "What genre is Back to the Future?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_14373", "text": "The main theme of Back to the Future concerns taking control and personal responsibility over one's own destiny. A situation can be changed even if it seems otherwise impossible to overcome. Thompson said the film represents how one moment can have a significant and lasting impact on a person's life. Gale believed Doc provided the perfect summary of the series' running theme, when in Back to the Future Part\u00a0III he said: \"Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.\" Even so, Marty's future is enriched at the expense of others. At the start of the film, Marty is rejected at Battle of the Bands and admits he fears his ambitions will remain unrealized. He worries he will end up like his parents and sees direct evidence in 1955 of George, also afraid of rejection, being unable to approach Lorraine; his fears risk Marty's future. Marty sets about manipulating the past to ensure his own survival without concern for what impact his presence in 1955 is having on others. On his return to 1985, he is rewarded with wealthier parents and a nicer car, but he has simultaneously damaged Biff's future, reducing him to a valet for the McFlys. Glover was critical of the film's ending. He believed Marty's reward should be happy parents in love with each other. He considered the ending a result of the film serving a corporate interest, promoting the accumulation of wealth and purchasing material objects. In 2015, Zemeckis said the ending was perfect for its time but would be different if he made it now. Gale disagreed and said he did not apologize for the scene. American audiences largely had no issue with this ending, but some international audiences criticized it. Despite rejection by film studios for not being raunchy enough, Back to the Future alludes to sexual assault, racism, and the Oedipus complex\u2014a psychiatric theory suggesting a child holds an unconscious sexual desire for their opposite-sexed parent. This refers to the relationship between Marty and his future mother Lorraine in 1955. The relationships between parents and children are the basis of many elements of the film. Where most people can only know their parents, Marty is given the opportunity to see his parents as his peers, when they were his age and shared the same ambitions and dreams as him. Justin Chang and Mark Olsen, suggest the film can be seen as promoting Reaganism\u2014the political positions of president Ronald Reagan\u2014promoting the older values of the American dream, self-reliance, initiative, and technological advancement. 1985 is presented as run down and in decay, while 1955 is presented as a more simplistic and seemingly safer time seen through the lens of nostalgia. Marty's future is bettered because he goes back to 1955 and teaches George to be more assertive and self-reliant. This leads to a more prosperous future for Marty with materialistic rewards. The film uses many brand names of the time, ostensibly to make the setting more realistic\u2014like Mountain Dew, Pepsi, and Texaco\u2014but the filmmakers received financial compensation for their inclusion, making them symbols of commercialism and thus materialistic. Sorcha N\u00ed Fhlainn argues many 1980s films resulted from the American public's desire for escapism from cultural anxieties and fears, including nuclear proliferation, unemployment, crime, growing inequality, and the AIDS crisis. Films like those in the Star Wars series and Back to the Future are designed to offer a childlike reassurance of safety and comfort. They emphasize idealized American values and the positive effects of instilling power in a patriarchal figure like George McFly or Darth Vader. Susan Jeffords notes Doc Brown is an analog for Reagan, a man who embraces technological advancement, who is in conflict with Libyan terrorists, and provides the means for a failing family to better themselves. The song \"Johnny B. Goode\" by Chuck Berry is used during the film's final act. Berry initially resisted allowing the song to be used in the film. NPR argued that while this may have been a matter of money for Berry, there are underlying racial issues involved in Marty, a Caucasian male, rewriting history to invent the rock and roll music genre, which was heavily influenced by African American music styles. The 1955 segment also presents a distorted view of America, showing an African American band playing at the high school dance at a time when this would not have been allowed. Similarly, the African American character Goldie Wilson is seemingly inspired to work towards becoming mayor by Marty's intervention, inspiring a Reagan-style initiative and self-reliance. As film fans, Gale's and Zemeckis' influences are seen throughout Back to the Future. There are references to The Wizard of Oz , The Shaggy Dog , Dr. Strangelove , Close Encounters of the Third Kind , the Star Wars film series, and television shows including Mister Peabody, Star Trek: The Original Series, The Outer Limits, and The Twilight Zone. There are also allusions to The Time Machine \u2014based on the 1895 novella of the same name by H. G. Wells\u2014and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, in which the central character seemingly moves through time. The DeLorean dashboard chronometer uses the same color scheme as the time device of The Time Machine. Ray Loynd opined Doc can be seen as a King Arthur-type, with Marty serving as his knight.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_582", "question": "What genre is Gone?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_38487", "text": "Turner cites Swans,  Melvins, Tool, Godflesh, and Neurosis as influences to Isis' sound, saying \"those bands laid the groundwork for us [...] we're part of a recognizable lineage.\" Early releases were derided as imitative of predecessors Neurosis, and he admits that the comparisons weren't \"completely unjustified\". However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided to be happy with the results.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1990, Hill's wife, Hildy Gottlieb, had left her job as an agent to head up Alec Baldwin's production company, Meadowbrook Productions. Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence.

In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". \"Mothership\" essentially means \"Main series\", where as \"Escort\" essentially means \"Spinoff\". One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

In April 2012, Tricky performed Maxinquaye with Martina Topley-Bird at several concerts around the UK including, for the first time in several years in his home town of Bristol. The concerts featured regular interruptions orchestrated by Tricky, where he brought his youngest brother, Marlon Thaws to rap on stage alongside other local rappers as well as encouraging the audience to come up on stage. The review of the concert in Manchester said it was \"shambolic\" and a \"car crash\" with Tricky often leaving the stage and continuously forgetting his words, leaving Topley Bird to carry the delivery of the tracks, resulting in many leaving early after repeated issues with Tricky's behaviour and shouts of \"wanker\" from the crowd. In February 2013, Tricky announced the release of a new album, False Idols. The album is the follow up from his 2010 Mixed Race and featured Peter Silberman, Fifi Rong and Nneka.

{"id": "91_589", "question": "What genre is Hotel?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

A full-length novel featuring him, The Moving Target, followed in 1949 and was the first in a series of eighteen. Macdonald mentions in the foreword to the Archer in Hollywood omnibus that his detective derives his name from Sam Spade's partner, Miles Archer, and from LewWallace, author of Ben-Hur, though the character was patterned on Philip Marlowe. Macdonald also stated the surname \"Archer\" was inspired by his own astrological sign of Sagittarius the archer. The novels were hailed by genre fans and literary critics alike. The Lew Archer novels are recognized as some of the most significant American mystery books of the mid 20th century, bringing a literary sophistication to the genre. The critic John Leonard declared that Macdonald had surpassed the limits of crime fiction to become \"a major American novelist\". He has also been called the primary heir to Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler as the master of American hardboiled mysteries. Macdonald's writing built on the pithy style of his predecessors by adding psychological depth and insights into the motivations of his characters. Their plots of \"baroque splendor\" were complicated and often turned on Archer's unearthing family secrets of upwardly mobile clients, sometimes going back over several generations. Lost or wayward sons and daughters were a theme common to many of the novels. Critics have commented favorably on Macdonald's deft combination of the two sides of the mystery genre, the \"whodunit\" and the psychological thriller. Even his regular readers seldom saw a Macdonald denouement coming. Screenwriter William Goldman, who adapted Macdonald's stories to film, called his works \"the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American\". Paul Newman played the lead role in two of the movies from the books which used the titles Harper and The Drowning Pool while Peter Graves starred in the TV movie The Underground Man. Tom Nolan in his Ross Macdonald, A Biography, wrote, \"By any standard he was remarkable. His first books, patterned on Hammett and Chandler, were at once vivid chronicles of a postwar California and elaborate retellings of Greek and other classic myths. Gradually he swapped the hard-boiled trappings for more subjective themes: personal identity, the family secret, the family scapegoat, the childhood trauma; how men and women need and battle each other, how the buried past rises like a skeleton to confront the present. He brought the tragic drama of Freud and the psychology of Sophocles to detective stories, and his prose flashed with poetic imagery.\" In a 2017 book review, the Wall Street Journal provided this summary of the author's style:\"... it is the sheer beauty of Macdonald\u2019s laconic style\u2014with its seductive rhythms and elegant plainness\u2014that holds us spellbound. 'Hard-boiled,' 'noir,' 'mystery,' it doesn\u2019t matter what you call it.

{"id": "91_597", "question": "What genre is One Thing?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_12610", "text": "The central theme of The Thing concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions. Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diaboliques Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that MacReady destroys the chess computer after being checkmated, and similarly vows to destroy the Thing, even at the expense of the team. The Cold War-style isolationism hurts the group, while a lack of trust destroys it. Screen Rants Michael Edward Taylor draws allusions between The Thing and the accusatory Red Scares and McCarthyism, as the film conveys an anti-communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation. Slant Magazines John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War \"fatigued counterculturalism\"\u2014the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities. Lancaster's script eschews female characters because he believed that a female character would be a love interest who inevitably gets in the way. The Atlantics Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, females are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. Indeed, several assimilations involve penetration, tentacles, and in Norris's case, opened up at the stomach to birth his own replica. The slasher genre favors female stars as they are perceived as weaker and therefore more empathetic, providing a cathartic release when they defeat the villain, but in The Thing the men are not meant to survive. Vices Patrick Marlborough considered The Thing to be a critical take on masculinity. Identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but masculinity prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other. Nerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizonss Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror, the notion that ancient, inhuman beings exist that do not care about humanity in any way. This also includes the fear of losing one's humanity, and being consumed, figuratively or literally, by these ancient eldritch behemoths. The Thing is a being beyond our understanding and possesses the ability to destroy all life on Earth quickly. Just as Lovecraft left his creatures undescribed, the Thing can be seen, but its shape is mostly indescribable, beyond the realm of human knowledge. Grey said that MacReady represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist, but Blair represents the Lovecraftian protagonist, who succumbs to his fear of the creature, is driven insane by the implications of its nature, and eventually becomes what he fears. The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self. It attacks, consumes and imitates an individual perfectly with memories and behaviors. The original is subsumed by an alien copy that is virtually impossible to identify. Den of Geeks Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\" Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could only be identified by a blood test. Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air.

The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like \"Deuces\", \"Sweet Love\", \"Liquor\", \"Zero\", \"Back to Love\" or \"Don't Check on Me\". His pure side of R&B is densely shown on every album that he has done, even after that his music started to be more tinged from other genres, with some examples being \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back To Sleep\" and \"Privacy\". Throughout his career Brown has always had a strong influence from hip hop in his music, and following his 2010 mixtapes, he approached the genre differently, starting to rap frequently on mixtapes and features, adding to his albums straight hip-hop songs like \"Look at Me Now\", \"Till I Die\" and \"Loyal\", or by doing performances that switch from his R&B singing to his rapping, like he did in several tracks from his album Heartbreak on a Full Moon.  His dance-pop side in the single \"Forever\" off his second album Exclusive opened the door for many other Europop songs like \"Yeah 3x\", \"Beautiful People\", \"Turn Up The Music\" and \"Don't Wake Me Up\", but it begun to be less present in his music starting from his album X.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Winslet was hand-picked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give , Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances. Cameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz' performance in the film to Goldie Hawn, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said. Jude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\" and single father raising his two daughters by himself after his wife's death. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday. Jack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend Ethan. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock . On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\" Eli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set, that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man. The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale together, although they do not share a scene.  The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair. Dustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate . According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster for a movie, saw all the light and came over to see what was going on. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it. Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers' remake of The Parent Trap , and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday. Veteran voiceover talent Hal Douglas was the narrator for the trailer, as well as other \"trailers\" that describe Amanda's situation at various points in the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Monk also continues to investigate Trudy's death. Monk's numerous compulsive habits and phobias compound his situation, such as his fear of germs. Monk is afraid of 312 things, including milk, ladybugs, harmonicas, heights, asymmetry, enclosed spaces, foods touching on his plate, messes, and risk. The OCD and phobias cause problems for Monk and anyone around him as he investigates cases. These same personal struggles, particularly the OCD, are what aid him in solving cases: his sharp memory, specific mindset, and attention to detail. Captain Leland Stottlemeyer and Lieutenant Randy Disher call on Monk when they have troubles with investigations. Stottlemeyer is often irritated by Monk's behavior, but respects his friend and former colleague's amazing insight and observational abilities, as does Disher. Ever since childhood, Monk's obsessive attention to detail has allowed him to spot tiny discrepancies, find patterns, and make connections that others miss. These insights work both consciously and subconsciously, so often Monk observes something \"wrong\" but is unable to pinpoint what it is until someone says or does something that triggers his understanding. In the middle of season three, Sharona decides to remarry her ex-husband and moves back to New Jersey, prompting Monk to hire Natalie Teeger as his new assistant. Natalie is a widow and mother of an 11-year-old daughter, Julie. Monk discovers Natalie when she is involved in a homicide case, in \"Mr. Monk and the Red Herring\". Natalie is able to understand and bond with Monk better than most people, largely due to sharing his grief over the loss of a spouse.

{"id": "91_614", "question": "What genre is Crusader Kings?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_5850", "text": "The First Crusade was preached at the Council of Clermont in 1095 by Pope Urban II, with the goal of assisting the Byzantine Empire against the invasions of the Seljuk Turks. However, the main objective quickly became the control of the Holy Land. The Byzantines were frequently at war with the Seljuks and other Turkish dynasties for control of Anatolia and Syria. The Sunni Seljuks had formerly ruled the Great Seljuk Empire, but this empire had collapsed into several smaller states after the death of Malik-Shah I in 1092. Malik-Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian Sultanate of R\u00fbm by Kilij Arslan I, and in Syria by his brother Tutush I, who died in 1095. Tutush's sons Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan and Duqaq inherited Aleppo and Damascus respectively, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other, as well as Kerbogha, the atabeg of Mosul. This disunity among the Anatolian and Syrian emirs allowed the crusaders to overcome any military opposition they faced on the way to Jerusalem. Egypt and much of Palestine were controlled by the Arab Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate, which had extended further into Syria before the arrival of the Seljuks. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuks caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta'li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuks in 1073; they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuks, just before the arrival of the crusaders. The crusaders arrived at Jerusalem in June 1099; a few of the neighbouring towns were taken first, and Jerusalem itself was captured on July 15. On 22 July, a council was held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to establish a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond IV of Toulouse and Godfrey of Bouillon were recognized as the leaders of the crusade and the siege of Jerusalem. Raymond was the wealthier and more powerful of the two, but at first he refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety and probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway. The more popular Godfrey did not hesitate like Raymond, and accepted a position as secular leader. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri , this title is used only in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term princeps, or simply retained his title of dux from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey had become a legendary hero, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\". Robert the Monk is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title \"king\". Raymond was incensed and took his army to forage away from the city. The new kingdom, and Godfrey's reputation, was secured with the defeat of the Fatimid Egyptian army under al-Afdal Shahanshah at the Battle of Ascalon one month after the conquest, on August 12, but Raymond and Godfrey's continued antagonism prevented the crusaders from taking control of Ascalon itself. There was still some uncertainty about what to do with the new kingdom. The papal legate Daimbert of Pisa convinced Godfrey to hand over Jerusalem to him as Latin Patriarch, with the intention to set up a theocratic state directly under papal control. According to William of Tyre, Godfrey may have supported Daimbert's efforts, and he agreed to take possession of \"one or two other cities and thus enlarge the kingdom\" if Daimbert were permitted to rule Jerusalem. Godfrey did indeed increase the boundaries of the kingdom, by capturing Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, and other cities, and reducing many others to tributary status. He set the foundations for the system of vassalage in the kingdom, establishing the Principality of Galilee and the County of Jaffa, but his reign was short, and he died of an illness in 1100. His brother Baldwin of Boulogne successfully outmanoeuvred Daimbert and claimed Jerusalem for himself as \"King of the Latins of Jerusalem\". Daimbert compromised by crowning Baldwin I in Bethlehem rather than Jerusalem, but the path for a secular state had been laid. Within this secular framework, a Catholic church hierarchy was established, overtop of the local Eastern Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox authorities, who retained their own hierarchies . Under the Latin Patriarch, there were four suffragan archdioceses and numerous dioceses.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A full-length novel featuring him, The Moving Target, followed in 1949 and was the first in a series of eighteen. Macdonald mentions in the foreword to the Archer in Hollywood omnibus that his detective derives his name from Sam Spade's partner, Miles Archer, and from LewWallace, author of Ben-Hur, though the character was patterned on Philip Marlowe. Macdonald also stated the surname \"Archer\" was inspired by his own astrological sign of Sagittarius the archer. The novels were hailed by genre fans and literary critics alike. The Lew Archer novels are recognized as some of the most significant American mystery books of the mid 20th century, bringing a literary sophistication to the genre. The critic John Leonard declared that Macdonald had surpassed the limits of crime fiction to become \"a major American novelist\". He has also been called the primary heir to Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler as the master of American hardboiled mysteries. Macdonald's writing built on the pithy style of his predecessors by adding psychological depth and insights into the motivations of his characters. Their plots of \"baroque splendor\" were complicated and often turned on Archer's unearthing family secrets of upwardly mobile clients, sometimes going back over several generations. Lost or wayward sons and daughters were a theme common to many of the novels. Critics have commented favorably on Macdonald's deft combination of the two sides of the mystery genre, the \"whodunit\" and the psychological thriller. Even his regular readers seldom saw a Macdonald denouement coming. Screenwriter William Goldman, who adapted Macdonald's stories to film, called his works \"the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American\". Paul Newman played the lead role in two of the movies from the books which used the titles Harper and The Drowning Pool while Peter Graves starred in the TV movie The Underground Man. Tom Nolan in his Ross Macdonald, A Biography, wrote, \"By any standard he was remarkable. His first books, patterned on Hammett and Chandler, were at once vivid chronicles of a postwar California and elaborate retellings of Greek and other classic myths. Gradually he swapped the hard-boiled trappings for more subjective themes: personal identity, the family secret, the family scapegoat, the childhood trauma; how men and women need and battle each other, how the buried past rises like a skeleton to confront the present. He brought the tragic drama of Freud and the psychology of Sophocles to detective stories, and his prose flashed with poetic imagery.\" In a 2017 book review, the Wall Street Journal provided this summary of the author's style:\"... it is the sheer beauty of Macdonald\u2019s laconic style\u2014with its seductive rhythms and elegant plainness\u2014that holds us spellbound. 'Hard-boiled,' 'noir,' 'mystery,' it doesn\u2019t matter what you call it. Macdonald, with insolent grace, blows past the barrier constructed by Dorothy Sayers between \u201cthe literature of escape\u201d and \u201cthe literature of expression.\u201d These novels, triumphs of his literary alchemy, dare to be both.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the end, Miranda's impassioned narrative of one man's story becomes the collective narrative of a nation, a nation built by immigrants who occasionally need to be reminded where they came from.\" In his review of the Off-Broadway production, Jesse Green in New York wrote, \"The conflict between independence and interdependence is not just the show's subject but also its method: It brings the complexity of forming a union from disparate constituencies right to your ears.... Few are the theatergoers who will be familiar with all of Miranda's touchstones. I caught the verbal references to Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan, Sondheim, West Side Story, and 1776, but other people had to point out to me the frequent hat-tips to hip-hop... Whether it's a watershed, a breakthrough, and a game-changer, as some have been saying, is another matter. Miranda is too savvy to try to reinvent all the rules at once.... Those duels, by the way\u2014there are three of them\u2014are superbly handled, the highlights of a riveting if at times overbusy staging by the director Thomas Kail and the choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler.\" Although giving a positive review, Elisabeth Vincentelli, of the New York Post , wrote that Hamilton and Burr's love/hate relationship \"fails to drive the show\u2014partly because Miranda lacks the charisma and intensity of the man he portrays\", and that \"too many of the numbers are exposition-heavy lessons, as if this were 'Schoolhouse Rap!' The show is burdened with eye-glazingly dull stretches, especially those involving George Washington.\" Reviewing the Broadway production in The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote, \"I am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show.

Washington, Jefferson, Madison\u2014they're all here, making war and writing constitutions and debating points of economic structure. So are Aaron Burr and the Marquis de Lafayette.

I love it like I love New York, or Broadway when it gets it right. And this is so right. A sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop , under-dramatized American history and Miranda's uniquely personal focus as a first-generation Puerto Rican and inexhaustible wordsmith, Hamilton hits multilevel culture buttons, hard....

In the same issue, Marvin McAllister noted that the production's heavy hip-hop influence works so well because \"Miranda elevates the form through this marriage with musical theater storytelling, and in the process, ennobles the culture and the creators.\" A review in The Economist summed up the response to Hamilton as \"near-universal critical acclaim\".

On July 17, 2012, it was announced that players who pre-order Medal of Honor: Warfighter would receive access to a Battlefield 4 beta. The beta for the game began on October 1 and ended on October 15 with a full release on October 29, 2013. Information about the next entry in the series, Battlefield Hardline, was leaked on May 27, 2014, and officially unveiled on June 9, 2014, during E3. The game was developed by Visceral Games and, unlike previous installments in the franchise, is centered around a cops-and-robbers theme. In July 2015, CFO of EA Blake Jorgensen announced a new Battlefield title would be released in 2016. This was followed up by Dan Vaderlind, EA DICE Development Director, announcing that since Star Wars Battlefront has been released, he will now be focused on the upcoming Battlefield title. On May 6, 2016, Battlefield 1 was officially announced, with an official reveal trailer on YouTube, and was released on October 21, 2016. In a May 2018 live reveal event it was confirmed that it the next installment would be a World War II game after several leaks suggested it would be set during this period, with the title revealed as Battlefield V. Battlefield V was released later that year on November 20, 2018 while also offering certain players early access to the game as early as November 9, 2018. Battlefield 2042 was released on November 19, 2021. During EA's 2020/2021 Q3 earnings call it was revealed that the game will be the first to release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, utilizing their processing power to feature more players than ever in the online portion of the game. Additionally, it saw multiple innovations in multiplayer, social, and competition aspects that are new to the franchise. After the negative reception from both audiences and critics for its bugs, glitches, crashes, and poor launch received by DICE for Battlefield 2042, Oskar Gabrielson, the general manager and long-time Battlefield veteran starting with Battlefield 3 of the studio is stepping down from the position and moving away from the Battlefield experience. Rebecka Coutaz, former Managing Director of Ubisoft Annecy, will be replacing him. Vince Zampella, chief executive officer of Respawn Entertainment and head of Ripple Effect Studios, formerly known as DICE Los Angeles will be taking on the role of \"big boss\", heading the Battlefield franchise as it moves forward. Along with the announcement, Marcus Lehto, former Creative Art Director of Bungie and the creator of the Master Chief of the Halo franchise along with his new studio in Seattle, funded by Electronic Arts, the same publisher who owns the Battlefield franchise will be injecting \"more storytelling\" into the franchise with the same name in post-launch content of Battlefield 2042 and future games in the series as part of the \"Battlefield Universe\", a series where it releases multiple entries interconnected with each other and carries a shared narrative. Battlefield: Bad Company 3 was an upcoming entry into the series, a follow-up to 2010's Battlefield: Bad Company 2. General Manager of DICE, Karl-Magnus Troedsson stated in a 2014 interview with Eurogamer that the game is not in active development as the studio doesn't know what exactly fans loved about the series as there has never been a clear line of the matter and they do not want to risk destroying the series. Despite this, DICE has made it clear that they will be developing Bad Company 3 at some point. In December 2021, Vince Zampella, the co-founder of EA's Respawn Entertainment, was placed in charge of the Battlefield franchise.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others.

{"id": "91_633", "question": "What genre is Star Wars?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_10610", "text": "The original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37\u00a0million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79\u00a0million. The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate. Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before Star Wars, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s. The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. Along with Jaws, Star Wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important. It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies, \"Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane, Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.\" It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon. Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences. Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for \"ruining\" Hollywood by shifting its focus from \"sophisticated\" films such as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels. One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, \"When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.\" In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg \"didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect\", which was \"a kind of rebirth\". The original Star Wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history. Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by Star Wars, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter, David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, and later Star Wars directors J.\u00a0J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards. Lucas's concept of a \"used universe\" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Alien , James Cameron's Aliens as well as The Terminator , George Miller's Mad Max 2 , and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy . Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film Inception.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1990, Hill's wife, Hildy Gottlieb, had left her job as an agent to head up Alec Baldwin's production company, Meadowbrook Productions. Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence. But at the same time, how else are we going to make a film that faithfully mirrors the truth out there in our society? This is a story about misfits in a world of misfits. It's a story about trust and mistrust and how mistrust breeds violence.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_635", "question": "What genre is Regeneration?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_3264", "text": "Producers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character. This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, William Hartnell. The term \"regeneration\" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a \"renewal\", and the Second Doctor underwent a \"change of appearance\". The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future. The serials The Deadly Assassin and Mawdryn Undead established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. The episode \"The Time of the Doctor\" depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set. Although the idea of casting a woman as the Doctor had been suggested by the show's writers several times, including by Newman in 1986 and Davies in 2008, until 2017, all official depictions were played by men. Jodie Whittaker took over the role as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, and is the first woman to be cast as the character. Whittaker had previously starred in television series such as Return to Cranford,  Broadchurch alongside David Tennant and the dystopian anthology Black Mirror. The show introduced the Time Lords' ability to change sex on regeneration in earlier episodes, first in dialogue, then with Michelle Gomez's version of The Master. In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, John Hurt guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\". He is shown in mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\" retroactively inserted into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors. Another example is from the 1986 serial The Trial of a Time Lord, where Michael Jayston portrayed the Valeyard, who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between the twelfth and final incarnation. On rare occasions, other actors have stood in for the lead. In The Five Doctors, Richard Hurndall played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later David Bradley similarly replaced Hartnell in Twice Upon a Time. In Time and the Rani, Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including Peter Cushing in two films. For more information, see the list of actors who have played the Doctor. The casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's sex , race and age .", "hasanswer": false}]}

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona , but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\" Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis , Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima , and Fluorescences , were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters. By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character. Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\" The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

As with many bands known for experimentation, changes have inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music has always included synthetic instruments, and this has been a source of contention among fans and critics, especially the band's heavy usage of synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on albums Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, and Hold Your Fire. The members of Rush have noted people \"either love Rush or hate Rush\", resulting in strong detractors and an intensely loyal fan base. In 1979, The Rolling Stone Record Guide called it \"the power boogie band for the 16 magazine graduating class\". A July 2008 Rolling Stone article stated \"Rush fans are the Trekkies/trekkers of rock\". They have been cited as an influence by notable musical artists, such as Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Dream Theater, Fishbone, Foo Fighters, Iron Maiden, Jane's Addiction, Manic Street Preachers, Meshuggah, Metallica, No Doubt, the Pixies, Primus, Queensr\u00ffche, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Smashing Pumpkins, Elliott Smith, Soundgarden, and Tool. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails has said that Rush is one of his favourite bands in the 2010 documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage, and has also cited the band's early 80's period in particular as a major influence on him in regards to incorporating keyboards and synthesizers into hard rock. Rush was eligible for nomination into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame beginning in 1998; the band was nominated for entry in 2012 and their induction was announced on December 11, 2012.  A reason for their previous exclusion may have been their genre. USA Today writer Edna Gunderson criticized the Hall of Fame for excluding some genres, including progressive rock. Supporters cited the band's accomplishments including longevity, proficiency, and influence, as well as commercial sales figures and RIAA certifications. In the years before induction, Lifeson expressed his indifference toward the perceived slight saying, \"I couldn't care less. Look who's up for induction; it's a joke\". On April 24, 2010, the documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage, directed by Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. It went on to receive the Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award. The film was also nominated for Best Long Form Music Video at 53rd Grammy Awards, losing to When You're Strange, a documentary about The Doors. A limited theatrical run began on June 10, 2010, and the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the US and Canada on June 29, 2010. The film explores the band's influence on popular music and the reasons why that influence has been under-represented over the years. This is done via interviews with popular musicians, music industry professionals, and the band members themselves. On June 25, 2010, Rush received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard. Critical acclaim continued to mount for Rush in 2010 when, on September 28, Classic Rock announced Rush would be that year's Living Legends awarded at the Marshall Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards in the UK. The award was presented on November 10, 2010.

The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed. The team's colors were originally powder blue, navy blue, and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city. The Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983\u201384 season. In the 1992\u201393 season, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo. The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the \"skating penguin\" logo, but with a \"Vegas gold\" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the \"skating penguin\" was readopted as the primary, though the \"flying penguin\" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995\u20132002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007\u201308 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders. The Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the 2003\u201304 NHL season. The team wore their powder blue, 1968\u20131972 \"throwbacks\" against the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 NHL Winter Classic. This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. For the 2011\u201312 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired. Called the \"Blue Jerseys of Doom\" by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms. In 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured \"Pittsburgh gold\", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002. The Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black \"Pittsburgh gold\" alternates, thus retiring the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016\u201317 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary. During the 2017 NHL Stadium Series against the archrival Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a \"City of Champions\" patch and a variation of the \"skating penguin\" logo. This design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018\u201319 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms. The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the 2019 NHL Stadium Series. In 2021, the Penguins wore white \"Reverse Retro\" uniforms based on the 1992\u201397 uniforms.

{"id": "91_657", "question": "What genre is The Sea?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_22634", "text": "Stevenson conceived the idea for the novel based on a map of an imaginary, romantic island which he drew with his stepson Lloyd Osbourne, during a holiday in Braemar, Scotland in the summer of 1881. He had clearly started work by 25 August, writing to a friend, \"If this don't fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my day. Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the Admiral Benbow public house on the [Devon] coast, that it's all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a derelict ship... It's quite silly and horrid fun \u2013 and what I want is the best book about Buccaneers that can be had\". Stevenson originally gave the book the title The Sea Cook. One month after conceiving of the book, chapters began to appear in the pages of the Young Folks magazine. After completing fifteen or nineteen chapters rapidly, Stevenson was interrupted by illness; he left Scotland and continued working on the first draft near London, where he and his father discussed points of the tale, and his father suggested elements that he included. The novel eventually ran in seventeen weekly instalments from October 1, 1881, to January 28, 1882. The book was later republished as the novel Treasure Island and proved to be Stevenson's first financial and critical success. The Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who served four terms as British Prime Minister between 1868 and 1894, was one of the book's biggest fans. Two general types of sea novels were popular during the 19th century: the navy yarn, which places a capable officer in adventurous situations amid realistic settings and historical events, and the desert island romance, which features shipwrecked or marooned characters confronted by treasure-seeking pirates or angry natives. Around 1815, the latter genre became one of the most popular fictional styles in Great Britain, perhaps because of the philosophical interest in Rousseau and Chateaubriand's \"noble savage\". Treasure Island was a climax of this development. The growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to 1719 when Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe was published. A century later, novels such as S. H. Burney's The Shipwreck , and Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate continued to expand upon Defoe's classic. Other authors, in the mid-19th century, continued this trend, with works including James Fenimore Cooper's The Pilot . During the same period, Edgar Allan Poe wrote, \"MS Found in a Bottle\" and \"The Gold-Bug\" . All of these works influenced Stevenson's end product. Stevenson also consciously borrowed material from previous authors. In a July 1884 letter to Sidney Colvin, he wrote that \"Treasure Island came out of Kingsley's At Last, where I got the Dead Man's Chest\u2014and that was the seed\u2014and out of the great Captain Johnson's History of the Notorious Pirates\". Stevenson also admits that he took the idea of Captain Flint's pointing skeleton from Poe's The Gold-Bug and he constructed Billy Bones' history from the \"Money-Diggers\" section of Tales of a Traveller by Washington Irving, one of his favorite writers. Half of Stevenson's manuscripts are lost, including those of Treasure Island, The Black Arrow, and The Master of Ballantrae.

The Book of Jeremiah says that Babylon will \u201cnever again be inhabited\u201d, that \u201cno one will live there, nor will anyone of mankind reside in it\u201d and that it will be a land in which \u201cno one of mankind passes.\"  Since Babylon is currently populated, debate exists among Christian factions as to whether Jeremiah's words will have a literal fulfillment after a future revival as a bustling city or whether his words are merely allegorical. Several Biblical prophecy scholars, most notably Chuck Missler, maintain that the \"Doom of Babylon\" as described in detail in Isaiah 13-14, Jeremiah 50-51, and possibly Rev 17-18 must refer to a literal, future destruction of an actual city. Missler has written that Babylon has yet to be completely destroyed as prophesied by Isaiah and Jeremiah. The Persians were able to take Babylon without a fight in 539 BC. In Jewish tradition, Babylon symbolizes an oppressor against which righteous believers must struggle. In Christianity, Babylon symbolizes worldliness and evil. Prophecies sometimes symbolically link the kings of Babylon with Lucifer. Nebuchadnezzar II, sometimes conflated with Nabonidus, appears as the foremost ruler in this narrative. The Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible refers to Babylon many centuries after it ceased to be a major political center. The city is personified by the \"Whore of Babylon\", riding on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and drunk on the blood of the righteous. Some scholars of apocalyptic literature believe this New Testament \"Babylon\" to be a dysphemism for the Roman Empire. Other scholars suggest that Babylon in the book of Revelation has a symbolic significance that extends beyond mere identification with the first century Roman empire.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Only one person does sing, a young boy named Asa Yoelson. Steve is bowled over by the boy's voice, but Asa realizes he should be singing at the synagogue with his father, Cantor Yoelson. Asa arrives late, and is later reprimanded by his strict father. Asa is reluctant to explain where he was, but Steve Martin visits the Yoelsons' home. He explains that he heard Asa sing at the burlesque house, and that he wants Asa to be part of his act. Papa Yoelson refuses to consider it. Asa is determined to be in the act, and runs away to Baltimore, where he is taken to a home for boys. The kindly superintendent, Father McGee, is moved by Asa's determination, and finds Steve Martin, but he also notifies Asa's parents. When they appear, Asa tells them that he will keep running away until they allow him to go into show business. Asa's mother believes that it would be better to give Asa what he wants than have him running away all the time. On stage, Asa gets bored with singing songs the same way all the time, and begins to improvise, much to Steve Martin's annoyance. When his voice suddenly breaks in the middle of a number, he starts whistling instead, but is unhappy and wants to go home.

For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project.

Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation.

It was Swiny in the late 1720s who encouraged the artist to paint small topographical views of Venice with a commercial appeal for tourists and foreign visitors to the city. Sometime before 1728, Canaletto began his association with Smith, an English businessman and collector living in Venice who was appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. Smith later became the artist's principal agent and patron, acquiring nearly fifty paintings, one hundred fifty drawings, and fifteen rare etchings from Canaletto, the largest and finest single group of the artist's works, which he sold to King George III in 1763. In the 1740s Canaletto's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice. Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of \"capricci\" in his vedute ideali, but the returns were not high enough, and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London, to be closer to his market. Whilst in England, between 1749 and 1752 Canaletto lived at number 41 Beak Street in London's Soho district. He remained in England until 1755, producing views of London and of his patrons' houses and castles. These included Northumberland House for Sir Hugh Smithson, Bt., who by marriage later became the 2nd Earl of Northumberland; and Warwick Castle for Lord Brooke, later 1st Earl of Warwick. Smithson was one of the commissioners of Westminster Bridge, and it is \"not impossible\" that he had encouraged Canaletto to come to England and record the beginning of the bridge's life. His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself. He was often expected to paint England in the fashion with which he had painted his native city. Canaletto's painting began to suffer from repetitiveness, losing its fluidity, and becoming mechanical to the point that the English art critic George Vertue suggested that the man painting under the name 'Canaletto' was an impostor. This may have been because Canaletto's nephew, Bernardo Bellotto, was also using his uncle's nickname; or more likely because the story had been spread by unscrupulous art dealers who had been passing off copies of Canaletto's own work and were anxious to see him return to Venice. Historian Michael Levey described his work from this period as \"inhibited\". In order to refute this claim the artist, through an advertisement in a newspaper, invited \"any Gentleman\" to inspect his latest painting of St. James's Park at his studio in Silver Street off Golden Square; however, his reputation never fully recovered in his lifetime. After his return to Venice, Canaletto was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1763 and appointed prior of the Collegio dei Pittori. He continued to paint until his death in 1768. In his later years he often worked from old sketches, but he sometimes produced surprising new compositions. He was willing to make subtle alterations to topography for artistic effect.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Suffering from amnesia, the man can only recall being shot at while trying to escape from a boat, and learns he possesses a bank deposit key and a tattoo of the Roman numeral XIII on his right shoulder. When men led by a hitman named the Mongoose arrive to kill him, identifying him as XIII, he finds himself forced to escape. Investigating the key leads XIII to a bank where he recalls he was investigating a conspiracy, but had set a trap for those involved that he inadvertently sets off. Forced to escape in the chaos, XIII finds himself arrested outside the bank by the FBI for the assassination of the President of the United States, William Sheridan. Interrogated by the lead investigator, Colonel Amos, the man learns that his face belongs to that of the shooter in the murder, Steve Rowland. After the Mongoose attacks the FBI headquarters, XIII finds himself aided by a female soldier named Jones, whom he remembers working with, and escapes from the city. Jones informs XIII that the pair were working with war veteran General Ben Carrington, who was conducting a parallel investigation into the president's death and had unearthed a conspiracy against the US government. Learning that he was arrested and taken to a base station in the Appalachian mountains, XIII proceeds to rescue him in order to uncover his past. Carrington agrees to help him, but instructs XIII to assist a contact in the Rocky Mountains. XIII meets with the contact who identifies herself as Kim Rowland, and that he is not Rowland; the real Rowland, her husband, died after committing the assassination. Protecting her from the men sent by the Mongoose, XIII is captured following an avalanche and promptly taken away to a mental asylum for examination after the hitman suspects him to be an impostor. XIII manages to escape, killing the asylum's director, before reuniting with Jones. Informed of a meeting taking place in Mexico, XIII is sent to eavesdrop on it within the base of a special forces group called SPADS. During his infiltration, XIII finds out, while listening to a pair of SPADS soldiers' conversation, that he is actually Jason Fly, a squadmate of Rowland. Gathering evidence that the conspiracy involves a coup using SPADS soldiers led by a powerful group, XIII deals with two conspirators, while eliminating a stockpile of weapons meant for the coup. Upon returning to the United States, Carrington rendezvous with XIII alongside Amos, and reveals to both that Sheridan's murder was conceived by Rowland, but was murdered by the conspirators after the assassination, but survived long enough to contact his wife. Angered by his death, Kim decided to get revenge, and decided to expose the identity of the group and their scheme to the authorities through faking Rowland's survival. Carrington reveals that Fly agreed to assist by undergoing plastic surgery to replicate Rowland's appearance; XIII recalls he had been close to identifying the leader, before something went wrong. With the aid of the FBI, XIII proceeds to uncover the identity of the conspirators, and infiltrates the meeting site of the group to find out how the coup will occur. With sufficient evidence, XIII, Amos, and Carrington meet with William's brother Walter, and explain to him the conspiracy - a group of powerful men in the United States, calling themselves \"The XX\" - due to the Roman numerals tattooed onto each member - planned a coup during a war simulation exercise using loyal SPADS soldiers, who would replace US democracy with a totalitarian government. As the coup involves a key military facility, Walter offers assistance to gain entry to the site. Shortly after arriving, XIII finds himself having to protect William's successor when SPADS begin attacking the site, eliminating the remaining members that had not been killed or arrested, before defeating the Mongoose in one final battle. With the coup thwarted, Walter holds a party on his private yacht. While seeking him out, XIII overhears Kim arguing with Walter, and has a flashback that reveals Walter was behind the conspiracy.

He also authored a number of books on computer programming during the 1980s. In his earliest published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds up his own literary universe. The Dialog om det 21. \u00e5rhundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer, , is a philosophical dialogue modelled on the classical style of Galileo Galilei's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The plot is set in a not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new humanistic view on mankind and its new ideology , called Wulffianism. Wulffianism is anarchic in the word's real sense, entailing an acceptance of violence as a means and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy. Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned dialogues. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry is in rhyme, metrical with a touch of subtle pastiche. With the episodic novel Adam Harts Opdagelser <5> , Neutzsky-Wulff began to find his style and obtained henceforth crowds of fans. The book's protagonists are Adam Hart and his partner Victor Janis, both working as \"occult detectives\". An ironically rendered Neutzsky-Wulff himself also appears in a more secondary role. The series continues with the episodic Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen <6> Victor Janis og s\u00f8n <7> , both representing a more conventional novel structure, and ends with an experimental novel, Oiufael , mainly written in verse. An episode from Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen was adapted as the short film Adam Hart i Sahara , based on his own screenplay. Though sometimes he breaks the traditional conventions of the genre, Neutzsky-Wulff sees himself as an author of science fiction. He emphasizes the genre as the most prominent stage of artistic interpretations of the mythology of our time. Anno Domini tells the story of an astronaut on a strange planet, experiencing a macrohistorical version of the evolution of humankind. In Gud <8> , the classical form of science fiction itself, is challenged: A group of people are, by means of an alien vessel, heading towards the planet of God. With Den 33. marts <9> , the plot is altered from outer to \"inner space\", a platform resembling that of an American author of science fiction, Philip K. Dick. A person living in the 1970s Copenhagen discovers effects of society as mere stage equipment. Library books are empty and he is trapped within city borders. In a sanitarium, this person \"hallucinates\" about another world where he features as an awaited Messiah. Havet <10> is, like Anno Domini and Gud, a novel about space travel. The supernatural setting pivots around the cards of Tarok. In Menneske <11> , a computer independently achieves consciousness and decides to find out what existence as a human being is like. Consequently, it embarks on a Stone Age odyssey, following the history of man, ending in a parody of the 1970s of Denmark.", "hasanswer": false}]}

MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language. Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by fictional races and monsters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers.  The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a fantasy world, complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by roleplaying, and advance the created character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling rules of the Dungeons & Dragons series of games. Such fantasy settings for MUDs are common, while many others have science fiction settings or are based on popular books, movies, animations, periods of history, worlds populated by anthropomorphic animals, and so on.  Not all MUDs are games; some are designed for educational purposes, while others are purely chat environments, and the flexible nature of many MUD servers leads to their occasional use in areas ranging from computer science research to geoinformatics to medical informatics to analytical chemistry.  MUDs have attracted the interest of academic scholars from many fields, including communications, sociology, law, and economics.  At one time, there was interest from the United States military in using them for teleconferencing. Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to play; some may accept donations or allow players to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed via standard telnet clients, or specialized MUD clients, which are designed to improve the user experience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector.

An accomplished and prolific composer, he began to focus more on reinterpreting standards and his own earlier compositions.  Blue Note attempted to position the artist at the forefront of a resurgent jazz scene in 1986 with the release of the two-volume State of the Tenor recorded at the Village Vanguard in New York City. The albums revisited the tenor trio form used by Sonny Rollins in 1957 on his own live Vanguard albums for the same label. Henderson established his basic repertoire for the next seven or eight years, with Thelonious Monk's \"Ask Me Now\" becoming a signature ballad feature. Following his brief return to Blue Note Records, Henderson was signed by the Italian label Red Records, for which he recorded two more albums in the piano-less trio format. In 1991, Verve records signed Henderson to the label. In January of that year, Henderson had made a guest appearance on Stephen Scott's Verve album Something to Consider, and worked with Verve producer and vice president Richard Seidel during the session. Henderson and Seidel had first worked together in 1979 while making Henderson's Relaxin' at Camarillo album. After Verve expressed interest in signing Henderson, the saxophonist had to quickly complete his existing contract with Red Records, which he did by recording The Standard Joe in March 1991. Seidel said in a 2016 interview with musicologist Joel Geoffrey Harris that he decided to offer Henderson a record deal after hearing him perform live at Fat Tuesdays in New York. Seidel served as producer on all five of Henderson's 1990s Verve studio albums.

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream.

The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death.

Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was \"the kind of character you rarely see anymore  he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it\". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \"a very tricky structure\" for a feature film. A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as \"an L.A.-set action mystery\", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board. By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project. Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: \"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me  writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \"very strong character\" at its core, and a \"powerful\" romance. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said: I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft  maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. The actor chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, whose work he admired. He said, \"It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.\" When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Multi-faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed. The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions. Satellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40\u00b0. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade. The most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible\u2013infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The album was chosen as the 'Favorite Girl Group Album' on the \"Girl Group Week Readers' Poll\" hosted by Billboard, beating Girls Aloud, Little Mix, Destiny's Child and Spice Girls album, as well as being listed by Fuse as one of the \"25 Best Albums Of 2014 So Far\", alongside artists such as Coldplay, Michael Jackson, Pharrell Williams and Mariah Carey. In South Korea, the album debuted and peaked at number 2 in the chart issue dated March 2\u20138, 2014. According to Gaon's mid-year charts, the tracks from Crush have been downloaded over 5.2 million times. Crush received positive reviews from a variety of publications worldwide; the record was named by Rolling Stone as the sixth best pop album of 2014\u2014the only appearance from an Asian artist on the list, with Charles Aaron writing \"Almost two years after K-pop first giddily barged into America's imagination, the genre hasn't sustained a post-\"Gangnam Style\" wave, but the Seoul machine [2NE1] keeps humming.\" He further highlighted the diversity of all its tracks, and identified \"MTBD\" as the album's centerpiece. Fuse noted the group's \"knack for genre-melding\" and wrote that \"After fans waited nearly four years for their second full-length album, the K-pop phenoms did not disappoint with a slew of forward-thinking, wholly-accessible tracks\". They selected \"Come Back Home\", \"Baby I Miss You\" and \"Gotta Be You\" as the album standouts. The publication further included Crush in their year-end ranking of best 40 pop albums of 2014. Billboard ranked it as the best K-pop album of the year, where they felt that it \"proved more than worth the nearly-four-year wait\" and highlighted the record's venture into new sonic territory with the fusion of different genres. August Brown of Los Angeles Times stated that \"'Crush' has one foot in each country's pop music: K-pop's neon melodies, with sounds from America's trap and bass-music scenes. It's the most coherent LP to come out of this generation of K-pop.\" Writing for Pitchfork, Corban Goble commented that \"The brash all-female Korean pop supergroup 2NE1's new album, Crush, bottles up contemporary trends as well as their usual EDM/reggae/hip-hop/R&B stylemash.

Priest's writing is gripping, and it's one of those rare books that reveal what writing is: manner and matter twinned and entwined.\" Elizabeth Hand described the book as \"exquisite ... an exceptionally frightening novel whose nightmare power derives from its chilling, almost clinical evocation of an historical reality with which we are all familiar, the London Blitz... a cliffhanger narrative of dual identities, betrayals, and shifting realities, as two versions of the twins' histories\u2014and England's, and the world's\u2014are woven together, like strands of DNA, to form a terrifying narrative. Priest has used doubles before to great effect, in his award-winning novel The Prestige; but The Separation trumps even that tale.

The brothers themselves recognize the uncertainty of motives and actions; Joe in particular struggles to believe that he's making a better future even though he realizes how much it costs him personally. Many alternative history novels are bloodless extrapolations from mountains of data, but this one quietly builds characters you care about\u2014then leaves their dilemmas unresolved as they try to believe that what they have done is 'right'.\" Pauline Morgan, reviewing the novel for SF Crowsnest.com, said, \"This is a glorious book to read\u2014not for nothing was Christopher Priest included in the line-up of Britain's best young novelists some years ago.

Although it undeniably helps, you don't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy The Addiction as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural.\" The Washington Posts Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor's performance, writing that she \"seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles.\" However, he praised Walken's performance, though summarized the film as \"serious and passionate; [Ferrara's] conviction, too, is unquestionable.

It also presents Camus' concept of absurdism, as well as many examples of human choices. The dilemmas faced by Daru are often seen as representing the dilemmas faced by Camus regarding the Algerian crisis and there are many similarities between the character of Daru and his creator Camus. Both are French Algerians exiled by the choices they have made. The main themes of \"The Guest\" are of choice and accountability. Camus emphasizes, characteristically of existentialist philosophy, that there is always a choice, that the only choice unavailable is not to choose. Daru chooses how he will handle Balducci and whether he will turn in the prisoner; the prisoner chooses whether to go to jail or to freedom. More important, however, is the theme of accountability.  The essence of Camus's philosophy is that everyone is \"condemned\" to an eventual, inevitable death, and accepting this allows for a certain freedom; the prisoner, having achieved self-awareness when Daru gave him the choice to flee or go to jail, realizes the futility of fleeing from the inevitable punishment and goes willingly to jail, thus revolting against the inevitable by making the decision of his own accord and holding himself accountable for the murder. Daru's choice can also be seen as a \"damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't\" situation.  Daru makes his decision based on what he believes to be the right thing to do.  The fact that he will be punished for doing the right thing does not make it any less right.  The important point is that people must do what they feel is right, without worrying about how others feel, or about possible rewards or punishments. Yet another theme can be extracted from this short story, however: complete neutrality is unattainable. This is evidenced by Daru's attempt to avoid making a decision; in the end, the Arab makes the decision for him, and he loses his neutrality.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Writers Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline. As promotion for The Avengers, Marvel released an official infographic detailing this timeline in May 2012. When Spider-Man: Homecoming was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of Homecoming into the previous films, such as The Avengers. This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of The Avengers and the events of Civil War, which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed. Additionally, dialogue in Civil War indicates that eight years pass between the end of Iron Man and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years. Infinity War co-director Joe Russo described the Homecoming eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\", and the mistake was ignored in Infinity War which specified that its events were taking place only six years after The Avengers. The public response to the Homecoming mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases, and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years, celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU. This timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of Black Panther and Infinity War by placing them in 2017. Despite the latter apparent mistakes, Thomas Bacon of Screen Rant described the timeline as \"the closest Marvel has yet come to making an official statement on just when the different MCU events are set\", bringing \"some sense of balance to the MCU continuity\". In October 2020, the Marvel section of Disney+ was restructured to include groupings of the films by phase, as well as a grouping that put the films in timeline order. Bacon felt the placement of Thor: The Dark World between The Avengers and Iron Man 3 and Black Panther after Captain America: Civil War in this timeline corrected \"previous issues\" with their placement in the November 2018 First 10 Years timeline, and was glad Disney and Marvel \"recognize[d] it's possible to watch these movies in anything other than release order\", \"legitimiz[ing]\" this viewing experience. The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Spider-Man: Far From Home were excluded since Disney did not have their distribution rights, but Bacon felt The Incredible Hulk could be viewed after Iron Man 2 since it is simultaneous with that film, Homecoming could come after Black Panther, and Far From Home could be viewed after Avengers: Endgame. Julia Alexander at The Verge agreed with Bacon that it \"seems like Disney finally understands how [some viewers] want to watch Marvel movies\". As of January 2022, the Disney+ timeline order is Captain America: The First Avenger, Agent Carter, Captain Marvel, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, Thor, The Consultant, The Avengers, Item 47, Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 3, All Hail the King, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, Loki, What If...?, WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Eternals, and Hawkeye.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_725", "question": "What genre is Deep End?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_36766", "text": "In 1977, a Warner Bros. executive, John Calley, sent Kubrick the proofs of what would later become the novel. Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Volcanos prodigious pyrotechnics and Tommy Lee Jones crotchety sneers at lava aren't quite enough to save this routine disaster film.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average using critical reviews, the film received a score of 55  out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. In 1997, the film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award in the category of \"Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property\", but lost to Con Air. Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, \"Volcano begins so excitably and hurtles so quickly into fiery pandemonium,\" but noted that \"in the disaster realm, it's not easy to have it all. A film this technically clever can't get away with patronizing and familiar genre cliches.\" Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times called the film a \"surprisingly cheesy disaster epic\" while musing, \"The lava keeps flowing for much of the movie, never looking convincing. I loved it when the firemen aimed their hoses way offscreen into the middle of the lava flow, instead of maybe aiming them at the leading edge of the lava\u2014which they couldn't do, because the lava was a visual effect, and not really there.\" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote that \"Things go bad after Volcano plays its last card \u2014 the lava \u2014 and from there it has nothing to show but more of the same.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Volcano is cheese, all right, but it's tangy cheese. I'm not sure I've ever seen a disaster movie in which special effects this realistic and accomplished were put to the service of a premise this outlandish.\" Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Examiner opined  that \"Volcano offers a bit of humor, a minimum of plot distraction and the joys of watching molten rock ooze down Wilshire Boulevard.\" Left equally impressed was James Berardinelli of ReelViews. He described the character of Mike Roark as \"a wonderfully heroic figure \u2014 a man of action who never has time to rest. The fate of the city rests on his shoulders, and he knows it.\" He added: \"Volcano has opened the \"summer\" movie season at an astoundingly early late-April date... This isn't the kind of film where it's worth waiting for the video tape \u2014 it's too big and brash, and demands the speakers and atmosphere of a state-of-the-art theater.\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times asserted that the film \"glows with heat. Lava heat. The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual.\" Writing for Time Out, author TCh said, \"The most striking aspect of this fun, old-fashioned disaster movie is the novelty of seeing the most familiar of backdrops used as a creative resource in its own right.\" Not entirely impressed was Margaret McGurk writing for The Cincinnati Enquirer. She stated that the high-caliber special effects were \"still fun, but all this lock-step storytelling is wearing thin.\" In a hint of commendation, McGurk added, \"On its own escapist terms, Volcano dishes up a textbook serving of low-I.Q., high-energy entertainment.\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle called Volcano was a \"laughably ridiculous take on what we all secretly dream of: Los Angeles, washed away in a huge, molten tide of cheese \u2014 uh, lava, I mean.\" Savlov added, \"Screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray have crammed the script with...reams of very, very bad dialogue. So bad, in fact, that the screening audience I viewed Volcano with seemed to enjoy it immensely, hooting and hollering and laughing as though it were an old episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\" Rita Kempley of The Washington Post  wondered why \"there's no volcano in \"Volcano\"?...The hokey disaster drama features towering plumes of smoke, a splendid display of fireworks and brimstone, and rivers of molten magma, but I'll be darned if there's a burning mountain.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety was more positive, writing that \"first-time screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray waste no time with exposition or scene-setting, starting the fireworks with a nerve-jangling morning earthquake that puts city workers on alert for possible damage.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

After Moira Lambert sang on their initial 1990 single \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" and Donna Savage was heard on the follow-up single \"Kiss and Make Up,\" Cracknell lent her vocals to \"Nothing Can Stop Us\" and ended up doing the rest of the singing on their debut album Foxbase Alpha.  Cracknell has been Saint Etienne's permanent vocalist since then. Preceded by the single \"Anymore\" in 1996, Cracknell released a solo album, Lipslide, in May 1997.  Originally released in the UK only by Gut Records, the album featured dance, indie and pop tunes and received good reviews from critics, although it was not a big seller . Lipslide finally surfaced in the U.S. three years later, when Instinct Records released it in February 2000.  With completely different cover art, the original album's track listing was also modified: five tracks were removed and four new songs plus a remix were added.  Months later, Instinct released the Kelly's Locker EP, which contained the five tracks originally removed from the UK version of Lipslide, along with two previously unreleased songs and a new remix. Cracknell was Spiller's first choice for the vocals of his number-one hit \"Groovejet \" in 2000, but never got to record the song.  She has recorded tracks with various artists such as David Holmes , Xploding Plastix , Cheapglue and Paul Van Dyk ,\" although billed as a collaboration between Van Dyk and St. Etienne but with Cracknell on vocals). She recorded a duet of Dusty Springfield's 1968 song \"I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten\" with Marc Almond for his album Stardom Road, released in June 2007. In December 2007, BBC radio began playing \"The Journey Continues\" by Mark Brown featuring Sarah Cracknell. The song consists of extensive samples from a composition by Elena Kats-Chernin entitled Eliza's Aria, well known to UK TV viewers as the music from the computer-animated 'For the Journey' commercials for Lloyds TSB bank. The single was released in February 2008 on Positiva. The song peaked at #11 in the UK after being released. Cracknell has collaborated with French pop star Etienne Daho on several occasions. She co-wrote and sang back-up vocals on \"Les passagers\" from his 1996 album Eden, and also co-wrote \"Le premier jour\" which was released as a single from his greatest hits compilation Singles. With Saint Etienne, they collaborated on the Reserection EP. Saint Etienne's single \"He's on the Phone\" was actually an English-language adaptation of Daho's French language 1984 single \"Weekend \u00e0 Rome\". On 21 August 2014, Cherry Red Records announced that it had signed Cracknell to a worldwide deal under which she would release a new solo album.  The album, entitled Red Kite, was recorded in December 2014 and released on 15 June 2015.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

Despite being offered the possibility of becoming Sergeant Major of the Army, he insists he just wishes to finish his tour and retire in peace to spend time with his family. Several years earlier, his older son had been killed in an Army training accident, and his relationship with his only surviving son, Billy , is strained. Zack's no-nonsense, unpretentious style of leadership quickly earns him a reputation on-post as a tough but fair NCO, well-regarded for his compassion and integrity. Zack owns a vintage Sherman tank from World War II that he has restored with his younger son's help, and he drives it for parades and other public events. While visiting an off-base bar, he meets a young woman named Sarah and the two of them strike up a conversation over drinks. During their conversation, the local deputy sheriff, Euclid Baker sees them together and orders Sarah to get back to work, insulting her and slapping her in the process. Carey quickly intervenes, subduing the deputy. Sarah had been forced into prostitution by Cyrus Buelton, the corrupt sheriff . Sheriff Buelton tries to arrest Carey, but finds he has no jurisdiction while Carey is on the base, which is federal property. Upon discovering that Billy attends a public school off-post, Buelton has marijuana planted in Billy's locker and arrests him. When Zack comes to him seeking terms of truce, Sheriff Buelton offers to drop the charges if Carey gives him a hefty bribe, roughly equal to his retirement savings. Zack hesitates and considers the deal, but his wife, LaDonna refuses to take part in \"good old boy\" justice and calls a lawyer. The lawyer is thrown into jail himself on trumped-up contempt of court charges, Billy is put on trial immediately without benefit of counsel and sentenced to several years of hard labor. LaDonna, finally realizing the depths of Sheriff Buelton's corruption and cruelty, goes to Zack and tells him what happened. When Carey tries to offer the bribe, Buelton accepts the money, but refuses to release his son, simply stating that it will prevent him from being shot \"accidentally\" or while \"attempting to escape\", or from being raped by other inmates\u00a0\u2013 temporarily. Carey decides to take matters into his own hands, delivers his resignation, and climbs into his vintage tank, destroying the local jail and police station and releasing Billy's lawyer. With Sarah tagging along, Carey departs for the county work farm, where they use the tank to liberate Billy and flee the town. His plan is to escape to neighboring Tennessee, where they can get a fair hearing regarding extradition. While repairing a shed track, though, Carey is injured, and Billy takes command of the Sherman. Buelton demands military intervention from Carey's commanding general, Major General V.E. Hubik . The general points out that Carey had already retired from the Army, so he has broken no military law. Buelton then demands that Hubik order the post's personnel and tanks to pursue Carey, and that if refused, he will call the governor of Georgia. Hubik again declines, this time citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which states that the Department of Defense is prevented from interfering in domestic law enforcement outside the military reservation without approval from his superiors or the President of the United States. Through a long series of chases and evasion through rural Georgia, while being aided by relatives of people jailed by Buelton and who died while incarcerated, the tank and its crew quickly become folk heroes. Despite Sheriff Buelton insisting they are criminals, the nation rallies behind them as a sort of modern-day Robin Hood. On the Tennessee side of the line, thousands of people gather to welcome the tank. Meanwhile, LaDonna has met with the governor of Tennessee, where she, with use of a rather direct and blunt threat of blackmail, manages to get a formal guarantee that they will be given a proper extradition hearing. A showdown brews at the Tennessee state line, where a huge crowd of supporters for the tank and its crew has gathered. Using a vintage antitank weapon, Buelton manages to immobilize the tank within a mud flat, forcing Billy to consider surrender. However, a motorcycle gang intervenes and attaches a wire rope to the tank, and the assembled crowd works to pull the Sherman out of the trap. Buelton goes as far as to order his posse to fire at the crowd, prompting a large line of Tennessee state troopers to draw their weapons in response, threatening to \"turn this into another 'Little Big Horn'\". Buelton and his men then race into the mud flat and begin pulling on their end against the crowd. Reaching a stalemate, Hubik takes charge and has a bulldozer brought over to help free the tank. Celebrating his apparent victory, Buelton climbs onto the tank and orders its occupants to surrender, but instead, Zack instructs Billy to rotate the tank's turret, which knocks him off and face down into the mud. Meanwhile, the bulldozer begins pulling the tank free of the mud with the renewed help of the crowd. This time, the posse's efforts to stop them are futile, and the tank is successfully pulled over the state line. Zack, Billy and Sarah climb out of the tank to a hero's welcome by LaDonna and the people and the governor of Tennessee.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream.

South Korean singer Luna's song \"Madonna\" referenced \"Vogue\" on its lyrics, \"When I grow up, I wanna be like Madonna / When I grow up, I wanna vogue how I wanna\". The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song \"was instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" \"Vogue\" has inspired flash mobs around the US.

The article noted, \"As a parable about it-can-happen-here fascism, V was far from subtle, but it carved a place for lavish and intelligent sci-fi on TV. Its impact can still be felt in projects like Taken and The 4400.\" In December 2008, Entertainment Weekly put V on its list \"The Sci-Fi 25: The Genre's Best Since 1982\", and called Visitor leader Diana's devouring a guinea pig \"one of the best TV reveals ever.\" For many years, Johnson has campaigned to revive V, and even wrote a sequel novel, V: The Second Generation, which picked up the story 20 years after the original miniseries . Warner Bros. Television declined to make a continuation as Johnson had planned, and opted for a remake instead. A reimagining of V premiered on ABC on November 3, 2009, and ran for two seasons. Though Johnson was not involved in the remake, which featured all new characters, executive producer Scott Peters said that it would nod to the most iconic moments from the original franchise and may potentially include actors from the original in new roles. Both Jane Badler and Marc Singer appeared in the second season. As of 2009, Johnson has also said he is still moving ahead with his plans for a big-screen remake of his original V miniseries though no progress has been made. On February 6, 2018, Desilu Studios announced that it would be producing a feature film of V. The film was to be written and directed by Kenneth Johnson, and produced by John Hermansen, Barry Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added, \"We are delighted to team up with Desilu to bring the timeless\u00a0\u2014 and timely\u00a0\u2014 story of resistance against tyranny into the 21st century\u00a0... V will be the first of a cinematic trilogy, which will tell the full epic tale in the manner I always envisioned.\" However, in late 2018, CBS reportedly had initiated legal action against Charles Hensley, a convicted marketer, whom they claim used the Desilu Studio name to influence investment into a shell company.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly: NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two\u00a0hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the series's cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2\u00a0million for 30\u00a0seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the Seinfeld finale at $1.7\u00a0million. In the U.S., 52.5\u00a0million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998.

The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36\u00a0million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl.

The singer intended the album to be a source of empowerment for young people; she wished she had written some of the songs before she attended high school. The album's sound was inspired by Trainor's love for throwback style records, and the music of the 1950s and 1960s eras in music. She created the album's sound by combining different musical genres, including: Caribbean, doo-wop, hip hop, soca and pop. The record was influenced by the American group Fugees. Trainor composed \"All About That Bass\" when she was an independent recording artist. She \"shopped\" the song around at various record labels and offered it to numerous artists, including Beyonc\u00e9, all of whom rejected it. Trainor, however, was signed to Epic Records by chairman L.A. Reid after she performed the song for him in February 2014. Reid suggested the song's demo should remain as the final version after additional audio mastering. \"All About That Bass\" was inspired by Bruno Mars' \"Just the Way You Are\" and The Chordettes' \"Lollipop\" . When Times Nolan Feeney asked Trainor what she wanted listeners to hear on Title, Trainor said, \"I want to help myself. I want to make sure guys take me on a date and treat me right because I didn't do that in the past. I want to love my body more. I just hope younger girls love themselves more, and younger people in general\u00a0...\" \"Dear Future Husband\" was inspired by Trainor's love of harmonies and a joke she made with her father, in which she said her future husband \"is out there somewhere, chilling\". With the track, Trainor wanted to convey that women should be treated better by their partners. \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" was a demo Trainor composed and recorded \"years ago\" that was excluded from the album's initial track listing. Trainor's uncle, however, insisted her management listen to the track. Upon hearing it, Trainor's manager started crying and said it had to appear on Title. Trainor then developed and produced the final version of \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" with a friend and sent it to American singer John Legend, who had the same management as Trainor. Legend replied, \"I love this, I want to be a part of it\", and later appeared on the track as a featured artist. Trainor felt the album's title track showcased her artistic style and said, \"I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like\u00a0\u2026 [a] totally different sound\". She described it as \"call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend and give me that title\".  \"Lips Are Movin\" was written in eight minutes; it was inspired by a situation in which she caught one of her label colleagues lying and American singer Sara Bareilles' \"Love Song\" . She altered the song's subject to infidelity so her listeners could relate to it more. At the time of the track's development, Trainor reflected on her previous romantic relationship in which she was cheated on and her then-boyfriend's dismissal of her aspirations to become a pop star.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After playing a set of two songs and enjoying the experience, the guys decided to continue and pursue the band full-time taking the Epidemic name from the Slayer song. After recruiting drummer Geoff Bruce and vocalist Carl Fulli to complete the lineup, the band entered a Battle of the Bands contest held at the Mountain View Theater in September 1987.  Having only recruited Fulli a couple of weeks prior, and having no previous experience, the band had no real expectations of winning the contest.  After the first night of competition the band had reached the finals and subsequently won the competition the next night. They won an opening slot for Death Angel the following month. The band recorded their first demo, \"Immortal Minority\", in December 1987.  Achieving minor success in the Bay Area and playing almost every thrash show at the Mountain View Theater, with the likes of Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Death Angel, D.R.I., etc. the band started to branch out further, playing shows at the Stone in San Francisco and the Omni in Oakland. In the fall of 1988, Epidemic came to the conclusion that they needed a drummer with further advanced double kick skills and Bruce agreed to leave the band. They recruited Bobby Cochran, a longtime friend and former Punisher drummer, to take over duties. With this line-up, Epidemic went into Telluride Studios in Palo Alto to record their demo, \"Demo '89\".  The band initially gave out 300 free demos after a Vio-lence show at the Omni and their popularity grew tremendously. The band sent out the demo to many magazines, radio stations and labels and created a name for themselves globally.  The band estimates that they sold roughly 5,000-7,000 demos on their own over the next two years. During this time the band was able to headline venues on their own. Epidemic's first headline show at the Stone was filled at 90% capacity. They also reached agreement with Marco Barbieri, who years later would become the head of the label Century Media Records, to become their manager. In addition, a deal was reached with Metalcore Records in Europe for the release of \"Demo '89\" on CD and vinyl. It would be the first official CD released by the band under the title The Truth of What Will Be, though it was only released in Europe. In January 1991, the band recorded another demo, titled \"Extremities '91\", which led to their signing of a record contract with Metal Blade Records. The band recorded their United States debut album, Decameron, at HOS studios in Palo Alto. The album was released in the summer of 1992. The band went on a two-week East Coast tour with Malevolent Creation and Suffocation in December 1992 to support it, and eight weeks later headed out on a nationwide tour with Cannibal Corpse and Unleashed in early 1993. Epidemic gained considerable exposure as well as experience, as this was what they thought was the beginning of their touring years. After coming home from the tours the band focused on writing new material but asked Higbey to leave the band. This was a difficult decision for the band but they moved forward as a four-piece and continued to write and prepare for their next album. Entering Razor's Edge studios in San Francisco in the fall of 1993, the band recorded their album, Exit Paradise, which was released in October 1994. The band decided to break up a couple months after the release of this album  due to differences in the band and the label's lack of support. In 2011 Divebomb Records approached the band to release all of the band's demos as a single release on CD. The subsequent release called \"Pandemic the Demo Anthology\" was released in the summer of 2012. In 2014 the band was notified that a label from Massachusetts called The Crypt acquired the rights to license the band's first album for Metal Blade, Decameron, and will release it on gate fold vinyl in the first half of 2015.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Many of his works are generally considered part of the dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism which Poe strongly disliked. He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as \"Frog-Pondians\", after the pond on Boston Common, and ridiculed their writings as \"metaphor\u2014run mad,\" lapsing into \"obscurity for obscurity's sake\" or \"mysticism for mysticism's sake\". Poe once wrote in a letter to Thomas Holley Chivers that he did not dislike transcendentalists, \"only the pretenders and sophists among them\". Beyond horror, Poe also wrote satires, humor tales, and hoaxes. For comic effect, he used irony and ludicrous extravagance, often in an attempt to liberate the reader from cultural conformity. \"Metzengerstein\" is the first story that Poe is known to have published and his first foray into horror, but it was originally intended as a burlesque satirizing the popular genre. Poe also reinvented science fiction, responding in his writing to emerging technologies such as hot air balloons in \"The Balloon-Hoax\". Poe wrote much of his work using themes aimed specifically at mass-market tastes.

Servant's first song to hit the Top 40 CCM charts, \"Come Jesus Come\", was first recorded in 1973 on Lonesome Stone's LP. Lonesome Stone was an outreach of Jesus People Europe, which came out of Jesus People Milwaukee , the latter forming the basis of what eventually became Jesus People USA in Chicago. After Jesus People Europe disbanded, Palosaari and others formed the Highway Missionary Society a year later, based in British Columbia, Canada, with Servant an outreach of the Society, based on the West Coast of North America.

The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like \"Deuces\", \"Sweet Love\", \"Liquor\", \"Zero\", \"Back to Love\" or \"Don't Check on Me\". His pure side of R&B is densely shown on every album that he has done, even after that his music started to be more tinged from other genres, with some examples being \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back To Sleep\" and \"Privacy\". Throughout his career Brown has always had a strong influence from hip hop in his music, and following his 2010 mixtapes, he approached the genre differently, starting to rap frequently on mixtapes and features, adding to his albums straight hip-hop songs like \"Look at Me Now\", \"Till I Die\" and \"Loyal\", or by doing performances that switch from his R&B singing to his rapping, like he did in several tracks from his album Heartbreak on a Full Moon.  His dance-pop side in the single \"Forever\" off his second album Exclusive opened the door for many other Europop songs like \"Yeah 3x\", \"Beautiful People\", \"Turn Up The Music\" and \"Don't Wake Me Up\", but it begun to be less present in his music starting from his album X.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1990, Hill's wife, Hildy Gottlieb, had left her job as an agent to head up Alec Baldwin's production company, Meadowbrook Productions. Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence. But at the same time, how else are we going to make a film that faithfully mirrors the truth out there in our society? This is a story about misfits in a world of misfits.

He encounters a variety of people come through various hidden doors in which each one claim that he can get out through his own door. His first visitor is a woman named Margaret who claims that the man is her husband Ted as she appears with parents are also present. Her door closes on the Man before she can get him out. The Man then meets Mr. Thomas , the manager of this entire establishment. When asked about the Cube, Mr. Thomas states that he has asked himself that question many times where it is too good to be true. Mr. Thomas shows the Man the Call Button that he should push if he ever needs anything. Mr. Thomas then works to deny the fact that there are other Cubes like this while stating that while some people are quite content and stay in the Cube, others would wish to leave. As Mr. Thomas leaves, he tells the Man that he must find his own door. Arnie returns again where he gives the Man a telephone and states that he can get him anything he wants. Arnie exclaims that the only trouble with this establishment is that there is no organization and The Man wouldn't believe the weirdos that run it. He also talks about the four tons of chocolate rabbits while mentioning that he's been working here for 14 years where there hasn't been a request for chocolate rabbits. As Arnie goes outside to call the Man to see if the telephone is working, the Man sees a brief opening until the telephone rings and Mr. Thomas briefly appears to give the receiver to him before leaving. The Man answers it and Arnie tells him that the telephone is in business. The Man discovers that his telephone only calls up Arnie. When the Man throws it towards the wall, Arnie opens it as it flies through as Arnie rewards his accuracy by giving him a chocolate rabbit. Two police officers consisting of a police sergeant and Officer Fritz from the MPD enter with a search warrant. They find different things in the panels of the Cube like smuggled diamonds in the chocolate rabbit, a stack of gold bullion from the Bank of Munich, vital plans of the X-74 , microfilm documenting the entire National Security System, an arsenal , and a bound and gagged Dr. Kingsley . The Man is then handcuffed by the police sergeant in an uncomfortable way as the police officers leave with everything while telling the Man to wait until they return.

She then changes her mind and wants tangerine paint as the Man struggles to get his leg out from the position the handcuffs have him in. Upon trying to hold back the info on how long the Man will be in the Cube, Miss Bix changes her mind about the paint and has shellac sprayed onto the already white Cube as she leaves. Arnie states to the Man that he is actually spraying deodorant and that Miss Bix can't tell the difference. Before leaving, Arnie stops the Man from following him since this is Arnie's door. A guitarist comes in and gives the Man the keys to the handcuffs which frees the Man. Upon finding a bed that manifested, the Man rests on it while the guitarist practices his music. The guitarist is then joined by the rest of his band as they sing a song to the Man about never getting out of the Cube. After the band leaves, Mr. Thomas briefly enters telling the Man that the \"Rest Period\" is over. A prisoner named Watson enters the Cube having escaped from his Cube. He notices that the Man hasn't been here for long while mentioning how his Cube had squares while the Man's Cube has rectangles. Watson tells the Man that he had to tell how many times has passed by making marks in his thumbnail which didn't work when he lost his thumbnails. Watson decides to return to his Cube to see if he left anything behind. When the Man states that if he re-enters his Cube where he won't get out again, Watson ranted about having to depend on the squares. Watson decides to go back to his Cube.

Arnie reprimands the scientist for breaking the wall and gives him his hammer back while he gets the wall fixed. Upon being unable to convince the Man, the scientist leaves hoping that the Man rots in the Cube. Arnie fixes the hole and leaves stating that the scientist is a real pain in the neck. A woman named Liza enters where she gives the Man a hint on how to get out which is \"it's going to get worse before it gets better.\" Her other hint is \"don't trust anybody\" as she turns into an elderly-like appearance . After she leaves, Mr. Thomas enters stating that the Man's time is up and that he must leave. As the Man tries to leave through the door that Mr. Thomas claims to be the Man's door, the Man has his suspicions in which if he steps out the door, two gorillas in ballerina dresses would grab him, drag him back into the cube, throw him to the ground, and dance around him singing \"Home! Sweet Home!\" The Man attempts to step out and is assaulted by the ballerina-dressed gorillas in the manner that he described where they substitute \"home\" with \"the Cube.\" Mr. Thomas leaves stating that the Man is getting pretty good at predicting these things. Two comics enter and tell jokes to the audience. They then turn their attention to the Man when they find that he wasn't joining in on the laughter. The Man stated that he just didn't feel like laughing. The comics then laugh at the Man before leaving. A kid on a tricycle rides around the Cube mocking the Man stating that he's never going to get out of the Cube and then leaves. A monk enters and disperses his wisdom onto the Man while stating that he is part of the \"All.\" Before leaving, the monk gives the Man an orb called the Ramadar which is supposed to hold the meaning of life. After the monk leaves, the Ramadar only makes a grinding noise. The Man smashes it with the stool to find that inexplicably it is made of strawberry jam inside. Arnie comes in and cleans up the broken Ramadar stating that most people break their Ramadar. Arnie then leaves with the broken Ramadar and the broken stool. After six people bring in a coffin, the Man finds a gun is left in the room. Grabbing the gun, the man attempts to shoot himself and ink squirts onto his face. All the people he had encountered enter and laugh at him as Arnie states that this is all a joke. Enraged, he tells them he's had enough with their tricks and that no matter what happens he knows he is real. The Man then leaves the Cube as the people applaud him. The Man is then escorted into an office so that the head of the organization can sign his release. Once there, the Man reflects on the revelation of his own realness. He accidentally cuts himself with a knife while demonstrating and is asked to taste his blood. He does so and discovers his blood is strawberry jam. The head of the organization and his office fade away to reveal the Man is still trapped in the cube.

The vast scope of Touhou Project derivatives prompted commentary, noting that Touhou Project became an unmissable aspect of Japanese consumer generated media. These d\u014djin activities are mostly responsible for adding original attributes to characters that ZUN may not have intended. ZUN, for the most part, had acknowledged, appreciated, and even encouraged these derivative works by imposing very few restrictions on the use of his works. The major restrictions are on unauthorized commercial distribution and the spoiling of endings; proper attribution to Team Shanghai Alice is a requirement. ZUN stated himself that he did not want the Touhou Project game series to be officially commercialized. The first publication of Touhou derivative doujinshi occurred during December 2003, following the release of Perfect Cherry Blossom; seven circles sold Touhou derivative works at Comiket 65 in December 2003. At Comiket 74 in August 2008, a total of 885 circles had Touhou derivative works on display or for sale, out of a total of 35,000 circles participating at Comiket. At Comiket 77 , 2,372 circles were dedicated to Touhou, breaking the previous record held by The Prince of Tennis at Comiket 66 , which had 2,130 circles. At Comiket 85 , Touhou was still in the lead, with 2,272 participating circles selling Touhou derivatives, compared to Kuroko's Basketball, the second most popular franchise at that year's Comiket, which had 1,462 circles. Throughout the mid 2010s, Touhou popularity at Comiket began to diminish. From 2015-2017, Kantai Collection was consistently the most popular series at Comiket. By 2019, Touhou was the fourth most popular series at Comiket, with less than half the circles at Comiket than the Fate series. The d\u014djin games based on Touhou include adaptations of other game series' mechanics with Touhou characters, such as K\u014dmaj\u014d Densetsu: Scarlet Symphony , Age of Ethanols , and Touhou Puppet Dance Performance . At Tokyo Game Show 2014, ZUN announced a collaborative project with PlayStation bringing unofficial, fan-made Touhou Project d\u014djin games to the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita platforms. Yuyuko Saigyouji and Reimu Hakurei also made cameo character appearances in Square Enix's game Lord of Vermilion Re:2. The music of Touhou has been a particular source of interest, and many arrangement CDs are sold at Comiket and other Japanese conventions. Among the most popular derivatives are the series of Flash music videos created by the d\u014djin music circle IOSYS, which are often shared on otaku internet forums and Nico Nico Douga. One such song, Marisa Stole the Precious Thing, was parodied in derivative anime music videos. Marisa Stole the Precious Thing, alongside Cirno's Perfect Math Class, Night of Nights, and Bad Apple were included in the d\u014djin game Touhou Spell Bubble. Toby Fox, the creator of Undertale, cited Touhou as one of his musical influences. Several fanmade anime have been made for Touhou. Albeit created by amateur studios, the projects have sometimes included appearance by professional voice actors, such as Rie Tanaka. D\u014djin anime of note include  by the circle Manpuku Jinja in 2011,  by the d\u014djin circle Maikaze, and Hifuu Club Activity Record ~ The Sealed Esoteric History by the Chinese d\u014djin circle Kyoto Fantasy Troupe.

After the successes of the romantic Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and the historical epic Devdas \u2014one of the most expensive Hindi films ever made at the time\u2014he had made a plan to make another film in the romantic genre. Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\". Furthermore, he added, \"Black is about the love between a girl and her teacher. They teach each other the dignity of living. To call Black a love story is a true compliment.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy.

Excavations at Wilson Butte Cave near Twin Falls in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America. American Indian peoples predominant in the area included the Nez Perc\u00e9 in the north and the Northern and Western Shoshone in the south. A Late Upper Paleolithic site was identified at Cooper's Ferry in western Idaho near the town of Cottonwood by archaeologists in 2019. Based on evidence found at the site, first people lived in this area 15,300 to 16,600 years ago, predating the Beringia land bridge by about a thousand years. The discoverers, anthropology professor Loren Davis and colleagues, emphasized that they possess similarities with tools and artifacts discovered in Japan that date from 16,000 to 13,000 years ago. The discovery also showed that the first people might not have come to North America by land, as previously theorized. On the contrary, they probably came through the water, using a Pacific coastal road. An early presence of French-Canadian trappers is visible in names and toponyms: Nez Perc\u00e9, C\u0153ur d'Al\u00e8ne, Bois\u00e9, Payette, some preexisting the Lewis and Clark and Astorian expeditions which themselves included significant numbers of French and M\u00e9tis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain. Idaho, as part of the Oregon Country, was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846. From 1843 to 1849, present-day Idaho was under the de\u00a0facto jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon. When Oregon became a state, what is now Idaho was in what remained of the original Oregon Territory not part of the new state, and designated as the Washington Territory. Between then and the creation of the Idaho Territory on March 4, 1863, at Lewiston, parts of the present-day state were included in the Oregon, Washington, and Dakota Territories. The new territory included present-day Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming. The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific and in 1806 on the return, largely following the Clearwater River both directions. The first non-indigenous settlement was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Lake Pend Oreille for fur trading in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company. In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near present-day Lewiston. This post, known as \"MacKenzie's Post\" or \"Clearwater\", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was bought out by the North West Company in 1813, after which it was abandoned. The first attempts at organized communities, within the present borders of Idaho, were established in 1860. The first permanent, substantial incorporated community was Lewiston in 1861. After some tribulation as a territory, including the chaotic transfer of the territorial capital from Lewiston to Boise, disenfranchisement of Mormon polygamists upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1877, and a federal attempt to split the territory between Washington Territory which gained statehood in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864, Idaho achieved statehood in 1890. Idaho was one of the hardest hit of the Pacific Northwest states during the Great Depression. Prices plummeted for Idaho's major crops: in 1932 a bushel of potatoes brought only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income of $686 in 1929 drop to $250 by 1932. In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries. Science and technology have become the largest single economic center within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Idaho enacted statewide crisis standards of care as COVID-19 patients overwhelmed hospitals.

Leonard found Out of This World a welcome antidote to The Avengers, which had proved a difficult production; he recalled, \"It was a great pleasure to make, getting away from today and exploring the unrealities of tomorrow. An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000. Shubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis. The actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence. Three scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K. Dick's \"Impostor\" and Clifford D. Simak's \"Immigrant\" as well as an original story called \"Botany Bay\", were supplied by Terry Nation, who would, a short time after, create the Daleks for Doctor Who.

{"id": "91_775", "question": "What genre is Creatures?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_12610", "text": "The central theme of The Thing concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions. Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diaboliques Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that MacReady destroys the chess computer after being checkmated, and similarly vows to destroy the Thing, even at the expense of the team. The Cold War-style isolationism hurts the group, while a lack of trust destroys it. Screen Rants Michael Edward Taylor draws allusions between The Thing and the accusatory Red Scares and McCarthyism, as the film conveys an anti-communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation. Slant Magazines John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War \"fatigued counterculturalism\"\u2014the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities. Lancaster's script eschews female characters because he believed that a female character would be a love interest who inevitably gets in the way. The Atlantics Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, females are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. Indeed, several assimilations involve penetration, tentacles, and in Norris's case, opened up at the stomach to birth his own replica. The slasher genre favors female stars as they are perceived as weaker and therefore more empathetic, providing a cathartic release when they defeat the villain, but in The Thing the men are not meant to survive. Vices Patrick Marlborough considered The Thing to be a critical take on masculinity. Identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but masculinity prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other. Nerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizonss Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror, the notion that ancient, inhuman beings exist that do not care about humanity in any way. This also includes the fear of losing one's humanity, and being consumed, figuratively or literally, by these ancient eldritch behemoths. The Thing is a being beyond our understanding and possesses the ability to destroy all life on Earth quickly. Just as Lovecraft left his creatures undescribed, the Thing can be seen, but its shape is mostly indescribable, beyond the realm of human knowledge. Grey said that MacReady represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist, but Blair represents the Lovecraftian protagonist, who succumbs to his fear of the creature, is driven insane by the implications of its nature, and eventually becomes what he fears. The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self. It attacks, consumes and imitates an individual perfectly with memories and behaviors. The original is subsumed by an alien copy that is virtually impossible to identify. Den of Geeks Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\" Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could only be identified by a blood test. Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming. During production, Carpenter considered having MacReady be infected, and an alternate ending showed MacReady having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected. Russell has said that analyzing the scene for clues is \"missing the point\". He continued, \"[Carpenter] and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn't know anything... They didn't know if they knew who they were... I love that, over the years, that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past the horrificness of the monster... to see what the movie was about, which was paranoia.\" However, Carpenter has teased, \"Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father later settled in Antwerp and was likely his first teacher. His brothers Frans Francken I and Ambrosius Francken I both became successful painters. According to the early 17th century biographer Karel van Mander, who referred to him three times using three different names, i.e. Ieroon Francken van Herenthals, Ieroon Vrancks, and Ieroon Franck, Francken was a pupil of Frans Floris. He probably went to work with Floris in the early 1560s. It is unclear whether he traveled to Italy after his training in Antwerp. Such a trip is suggested by a work of his hand dated 1565 that depicts a scene from the Carnival of Venice . From 1566 to 1572 he was in France where he was one of the masters employed to decorate the Palace of Fontainebleau. Cornelis Floris, the Antwerp architect and brother of Francken's master Frans Floris, sent his son to Paris in 1568 to train with Hieronymus Francken I.  Hieronymus became a master in Paris in 1570 and a naturalized French citizen in 1572.  This did not stop him from returning to Antwerp regularly. In 1571 he was back in Antwerp to finish the Adoration of the Magi that had been left unfinished by Frans Floris when he died in 1570.  In 1574 he is documented in Antwerp. In 1571 he collaborated with his younger brother Frans on a large Adoration of the Magi triptych which bears his monogram as well as that of his younger brother Frans.  The brothers included self-portraits in profile: Hieronymus on the left side and Frans on the right side of the triptych.   From 1578 until his death Hieronymus lived in Paris and Fontainebleau. In 1578 Hieronymus married for the second time.  His second wife was Fran\u00e7oise Miraille, the daughter of an Italian embroiderer who was also concierge of Madame de la Roche-sur-Yon in Tournon Street.  The couple went on to have seven children. In 1619 four of his children were recorded as still being alive.  His daughter Isabella was a history and genre painter.  He was successful and frequented higher middle-class circles.  It is possibly that he also operated a side business as an art dealer. Hieronymus was appointed court painter to the French court in 1594.  His service at the French court had already started before this date. In the course of his career he served a large number of kings and queens including Louise de Lorraine , Henry III of France , the Queen-mother Catherine de' Medici and Henry IV of France as well as Marie de' Medici .  Near the end of his life, in 1607, Hieronymus was elevated to the nobility and could from then onwards refer to himself as 'noble homme, peintre du roy' . Hieronymus Francken I was the teacher of Abraham Bloemaert during Bloemaert's short stay in Paris and Fontainebleau from 1581 to 1583.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Initially, the mystery of Dawn's sudden existence is not acknowledged in the series, with the other characters accepting her as a part of the status quo. Four episodes later, Buffy discovers Dawn is, in fact, a mystical object known as The Key; a group of monks transformed The Key into human form and sent it to the Slayer for protection from the villainous Glory . The memories of Buffy and her associates were altered, along with relevant records, so that they believed her to have always existed as Buffy's sister. She is shown to look up greatly to Willow and Tara and has a crush on Xander. She also is friendly with Spike, who is as protective of her as Buffy herself. When Dawn learns of her origin, she resorts to self-harm and runs away from home, until Buffy assures her they are real sisters no matter what, securing it with a blood oath. Her relationship with Buffy, having been portrayed with a typical sister dynamic in the first half of the season, changes when she discovers what she is. The two become closer as Dawn becomes Buffy's sole focus once she drops out from college to protect her, going as far as to warn her friends she is prepared to kill anyone who attempts to go near Dawn in the finale. Dawn suffers more pain when her mother dies unexpectedly from a brain aneurysm, which leads to Dawn resorting to black magic to try to bring her back from the grave, an action she immediately reverses upon realizing the consequences of her actions. It is eventually revealed that Dawn's purpose as The Key is to open portals to alternate dimensions \u2014 a power the hell-god Glory wishes to exploit to return home. When Glory successfully uses Dawn's blood to break down the dimensional barriers, Buffy sacrifices her own life to end the apocalypse and save Dawn; Buffy's sacrifice also neutralizes the power of The Key, giving Dawn the opportunity of a normal life. The following season opening sees Dawn struggle with abandonment issues, as well as her escalating kleptomania. Having been devastated by her sister's death, Dawn is overjoyed when Willow casts a spell to bring her back to life. However, with Buffy spiraling into a deep depression, Dawn feels highly neglected and is often seen alone and seeking attention from her sister, as well as other members of the group. She later experiences her first kiss with a vampire named Justin, whom she is reluctantly forced to stake when he tries to turn her. Dawn's isolation from the other characters reaches its apex when she inadvertently makes a wish to the vengeance demon Halfrek , which results in trapping everyone who enters the Summers house. Halfrek herself is inadvertently trapped, and undoes the curse to free herself; meanwhile, Dawn's kleptomania and feelings of neglect by her friends and family are exposed. Buffy vows to mend their relationship and starts spending more time with her sister, whilst still trying to shield her from her life as a Slayer, much to Dawn's disappointment, as she is eager to help Buffy in her duties. While helping Buffy battle demons in the season finale, Dawn proves herself to be capable in a fight, finally earning her sister's respect and a promise to train her. In the final season, Dawn becomes more grown-up and a full-fledged member of the \"Scooby Gang\" \u2014 as witnessed in the first few episodes when she aids Buffy and Xander during Willow's absence, and is trained by Buffy in combat. When Buffy expresses her doubts about her first day as a guidance counselor at the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High in the episode \"Help\", Dawn assures her that she'll be fine and that she'll be a great counselor. Falling victim to a love spell in the episode \"Him\", Dawn displays dangerous behavior such as attacking people and trying to commit suicide to prove her \"love\" for classmate RJ Brooks. While home alone one night, Dawn is forced to perform a solo exorcism to protect what she believes to be her mother from a demon, though it is revealed to be The First Evil attempting to cause Dawn to doubt her bond with Buffy, which she does for several episodes following this. Dawn's feelings of neglect begin to resurface as Buffy spends time training the potentials now living in their home. After wrongly believing herself to be a Potential Slayer, Xander explains to Dawn that being normal is perhaps the hardest burden of all, as nobody understands the pain of being overlooked \u2014 as he has been in Dawn's shoes.

He had found an aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the Muses, or the nymphs of Nysa. Athena was also present to witness the contest. Marsyas taunted Apollo for \"wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts\". He also further said, 'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!' The Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could \"do whatever he wanted\" to the loser. According to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the Nysiads. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas' haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr. According to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack. Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him. Apollo flayed the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed Marsyas' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons Linus and Orpheus. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined Cybele in her wanderings to as far as Hyperborea.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona , but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas.

Only when he has gained confidence after being accused does he succeed, grinning widely at the audience. At one point, during what is supposed to be a serious solo scene by Sykes, Edwards could be seen by the audience in his shirtsleeves and braces relaxing in the wings on an armchair. He is smoking a cigarette, flicking over pages of the play's script and making occasional wry faces at Sykes's performance, while Sykes feigns puzzlement at the audience's laughter.

She weighed approximately 75 pounds at her lowest weight. She spent time in five different treatment centers, and visited doctors and psychologists across the country. One day after returning from a family vacation, she began to feel faint, and was rushed to a hospital, where her heart stopped for eight seconds. She has since recovered and become a vocal spokesperson against eating disorders in Mexico. In 2008, with the support of Televisa, Anah\u00ed launched a campaign against anorexia and bulimia. In 2006, the tax administration of Mexico froze four of Anah\u00ed's bank accounts as a preventive measure because she was under investigation for tax fraud. In 2008, after taking the issue to court, Anah\u00ed was granted her accounts back, two with Banamex and two at Scotiabank. In 2007, a Barbie doll version of Anah\u00ed, Dulce Maria, and Maite Perroni were released, based on their characters in Rebelde. People en Espa\u00f1ol named her one of their \"50 Most Beautiful\" in 2010. On March 11, 2011, doctors discovered that Anah\u00ed's brain was being deprived of a large percentage of oxygen due to a deviated septum.  It was determined that this was the main cause of several ailments that had plagued Anah\u00ed, including a heart attack. She underwent a successful operation. On March 23, 2011, Anah\u00ed became the spokeswoman for Snickers in Latin America. The advertising campaign that was launched sparked controversy, with National Council to Prevent Discrimination and the National Institute of Women deeming the commercial sexist and filing complaints. Anah\u00ed defended the campaign, saying that the commercial wasn't intended to offend anyone. Effem Mexico, the company behind Snickers, disagreed with the sexism complaints. However, before the advertisement aired, they conducted a survey among women, asking their opinions on the content. According to Effem, the majority of the women surveyed did not feel the advertisement was discriminatory. On September 18, 2011, National Geographic aired the original production of \"Obsession: Bodies That Scream\", filmed in Latin America, which featured the testimonies of people who suffer from body dysmorphia and eating disorders. Anah\u00ed spoke about the five-year period in which she suffered from anorexia, and her recovery.  On October 12, 2011, Anah\u00ed joined the Non-Violence Project's campaign, \"Imagine One Billion Faces For Peace\", as a Global Ambassador. The campaign's ambassadors include public figures such as Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono, and Ringo Starr. The campaign aims to honor the legacy of the late John Lennon by calling for peace and non-violence worldwide. During the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Anah\u00ed, alongside other Global Ambassadors, performed in an event for The Non-Violence Project presented by Yoko Ono. Maxim named her as one of the Maxim Hot 100 of 2012, calling her a \"Mexican beauty\" who represents \"a true triple threat: she sings, she acts, and writes hilarious tweets\". On July 16, 2013, a nail polish line by Anah\u00ed titled \"BE by Anah\u00ed\" was released. The line is a collection of 25 different colors, with names relating to her music like \"rebelde\", \"delirio\", \"absurda\", \"click\", \"hipn\u00f3tico\" and \"S\u00e1lvame\".

Born and raised in Xalapa, Mario Talavera was the son of Francisco and Sebastiana Talavera. The young Mario grew up with an intense love for music, especially opera and art songs. He also showed an early interest for composition, writing his first piece of music at the age of nine. As a teenager, he moved with his parents to C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz, where he completed his basic education. Talavera then moved to Mexico City and joined the opera company, where he honed his vocal skills and achieved his dream of singing before large audiences opera works as Giacomo Puccini's La boh\u00e8me, that gave him the musical direction he had long coveted, although his main contribution was as a popular music songwriter rather than as an opera singer. During the decade of the 1920s, Talavera was part of several ensembles of traditional Mexican music, toured with the Orquesta T\u00edpica Presidencial, and organized and led various groups. Some of his most popular tunes include Amar en silencio, Arrullo, Bendita seas, China, El Nopal, Flor de Mayo, Jesusita la Vaquera and Muchachita m\u00eda.

{"id": "91_807", "question": "What genre is The Attack?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_67640", "text": "Scholar Carol J. Clover has argued that the film, and its genre at large, links sexuality with danger, saying that killers in slasher films are fueled by a \"psychosexual fury\" and that all the killings are sexual in nature. She reinforces this idea by saying that \"guns have no place in slasher films\" and when examining the film I Spit on Your Grave she notes that \"a hands-on killing answers a hands-on rape in a way that a shooting, even a shooting preceded by a humiliation, does not.\" Equating sex with violence is important in Halloween and the slasher genre according to film scholar Pat Gill, who made a note of this in her essay \"The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, and the Family\". She remarks that Laurie's friends \"think of their babysitting jobs as opportunities to share drinks and beds with their boyfriends. One by one they are killed ... by Michael Myers an asylum escapee who years ago at the age of six murdered his sister for preferring sex to taking care of him.\" Carpenter has distanced himself from these interpretations, saying \"It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In Halloween, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.\" In another interview, Carpenter said that readings of the film as a morality play \"completely missed the point,\" adding, \"The one girl who is the most sexually uptight just keeps stabbing this guy with a long knife. She's the most sexually frustrated. She's the one that's killed him. Not because she's a virgin but because all that sexually repressed energy starts coming out. She uses all those phallic symbols on the guy.\" Some feminist critics, according to historian Nicholas Rogers, \"have seen the slasher movies since Halloween as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hard-core pornography.\" Critics such as John Kenneth Muir state that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of \"any good planning\" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in Halloween and Halloween II only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers. However, Clover has argued that despite the violence against women, Halloween and other slasher films turned women into heroines. In many pre-Halloween horror films, women are depicted as helpless victims and are not safe until they are rescued by a strong masculine hero. Despite the fact that Loomis saves Strode, Clover asserts that Halloween initiates the role of the \"final girl\" who ultimately triumphs in the end. Strode fights back against Myers and severely wounds him. Had Myers been a normal man, Strode's attacks would have killed him; even Loomis, the male hero of the story, who shoots Michael repeatedly with a revolver, cannot kill him. Aviva Briefel argued that moments such as when Michael's face was temporarily revealed are meant to give pleasure to the male viewer. Briefel further argues that these moments are masochistic in nature and give pleasure to men because they are willingly submitting themselves to the women of the film; they submit themselves temporarily because it will make their return to authority even more powerful. Critics, such as Gill, see Halloween as a critique of American social values. She remarks that parental figures are almost entirely absent throughout the film, noting that when Laurie is attacked by Michael while babysitting, \"No parents, either of the teenagers or of the children left in their charge, call to check on their children or arrive to keen over them.\" According to Gill, the dangers of suburbia is another major theme that runs throughout the film and the slasher genre at large: Gill states that slasher films \"seem to mock white flight to gated communities, in particular the attempts of parents to shield their children from the dangerous influences represented by the city.\" Halloween and slasher films, generally, represent the underside of suburbia to Gill. Myers was raised in a suburban household and after he escapes the mental hospital he returns to his hometown to kill again; Myers is a product of the suburban environment, writes Gill. Michael is thought by some to represent evil in the film. This is based on the common belief that evil never dies, nor does evil show any remorse. This idea is demonstrated in the film when Dr. Loomis discusses Michael's history with the sheriff. Loomis states, \"I spent eight years trying to reach him [Michael Myers], and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply ... evil.\" Loomis also refers to Michael as \"evil\" when he steals his car at the sanitarium.", "hasanswer": false}]}

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

The titular \"game\" involves handcuffing Jessie to the bed for lovemaking, a recent addition to their marriage that both partners find exciting. This time, however, Jessie finds herself reluctant after being handcuffed to the bedposts and asks to stop, only to be ignored by Gerald, who pretends her protests are only part of their game. Realizing her husband is deliberately feigning ignorance and that he plans to rape her, Jessie lashes out, kicking Gerald in the chest. The shock causes him to have a fatal heart attack. He dies, leaving Jessie still handcuffed to the bed. At first Jessie is only horrified at her husband's death and fears the humiliation of being discovered semi-naked and handcuffed, but she quickly realizes the situation is far more dire: it is unlikely that she or Gerald will be missed for several days, no one will think to look for them at the lake house, and all the usual lake residents have gone for the season. There is a real possibility that Jessie will die if she cannot escape. While Jessie frantically explores and rejects plans, a combination of panic and thirst causes her to hallucinate voices: \"The Goodwife\" or \"Goody Burlingame,\" a Puritanical version of herself that undermines her escape attempts by insisting things will be fine and that she should wait to be rescued; \"Punkin,\" a representation of Jessie as a 10-year-old girl; Ruth Neary, a college roommate whom Jessie abandoned after a conversation that strayed dangerously close to uncovering Jessie's childhood; and Nora, Jessie's former psychologist, whom Jessie likewise abandoned when Nora questioned Jessie's relationship with her father. Guided by these voices, Jessie realizes that \"Goody's\" advice to wait for rescue stems from a subconscious belief that she deserves to be trapped in this situation, even if it means her death. When she probes for the reason behind this self-destructive belief, Jessie is able to recall a long-repressed memory of being sexually abused by her father during a solar eclipse when Jessie was ten. Her father manipulated young Jessie into believing that she was complicit, resulting in lifelong feelings of shame and guilt. Jessie also remembers an inexplicable event in the aftermath of the abuse, during which she experienced a momentary psychic connection with an unknown woman. The memories cause Jessie to acknowledge how unhappy and controlling her marriage to Gerald was, leading her to suspect she gave up her independent and courageous spirit for the security of being Gerald's trophy wife. Waking from an imaginary confrontation with all these characters to a dark bedroom, Jessie sees a tall, gaunt apparition, whom she initially mistakes for the spirit of her long-dead father and whom she nicknames \"Space Cowboy\" . The figure shows her a wicker basket of jewelry mixed with human bones. Unsure if the figure is another hallucination, Jessie dismisses it, saying aloud it is \"only made of moonlight,\" which seems to make it vanish. Her inner voices, however, believe the figure is real and that it will return to harm Jessie if she does not escape by the next night. The following morning, Jessie manages to secure a drink of water from a glass on the bedside table. Refreshed and encouraged by her own ingenuity in getting the water, she renews her efforts to escape, first by trying to break the headboard, then by trying to slip off the bed and push it to the bureau where the keys are placed. Inspired by her memory of the eclipse, in which her father warned her not to cut herself on the smoked glass panes they used as eclipse viewers, Jessie breaks the water glass and uses a sharp shard to slice her wrist, giving herself a degloving injury to lubricate her skin enough to slide her right hand from the cuff. She is then able to escape the bed, reach the keys, and free her other hand, only to faint from blood loss. When she awakens, it is nearly dark and the Space Cowboy, now undeniably real, has returned. Jessie throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones, thinking that is what he wanted all along. Still dazed and weak with blood loss, she reaches her car and drives away, only to discover the Space Cowboy hidden in the back seat. Jessie crashes and is knocked unconscious. Months later, Jessie is still recuperating from her ordeal. An attorney at Gerald's law firm assists her in covering up the incident to protect her and the law firm from scandal, but Jessie feels this is another version of burying her trauma, just as she buried her childhood abuse years before. To free herself, Jessie writes to the real Ruth, with whom she has not spoken in decades, detailing what really happened at the lake house and subsequent events. The \"Space Cowboy\" was a serial killer and necrophile named Raymond Andrew Joubert who had been living in and robbing lake houses in the area. Jessie confronted Joubert at his court hearing, where Joubert mocked her \"made of moonlight\" statement, confirming that the encounter really occurred and causing Jessie to spit in his face. Being able to directly confront the man who once terrified her allowed her to face the other manipulative men in her life, including her father and Gerald, freeing her of fear and allowing her to deal more honestly with her past. She apologizes for abandoning Ruth, acknowledging that Ruth had confronted her with a truth she could not then face, and hopes they can resume their friendship. After mailing the letter, Jessie is able to sleep without nightmares for the first time since her ordeal at the lake house.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By molding what academic Daniel J. Boorstin called \"an image\", which \"is not simply a trademark, a design, a slogan or an easily remembered picture\", but \"a studiously crafted personality profile of an individual, institution, corporation, product or service\", Hilton successfully parlayed her early tabloid notoriety \u2014mainly prompted by personal scandals and controversies\u2014 into a lucrative entertainment and endorsement career. In 2020, Los Angeles Times regarded Hilton as \"the woman who will likely go down in history for putting the 'i' in influencer\". GQ had previously called her \"the figure who set off Hollywood 2.0's Big Bang, the effects of which continue to radiate through the industry today. Hilton, the one who made it possible to be famous for doing nothing, was so sought-after in the [...] 2000s that you couldn't get her to walk to her mailbox without giving her a check\". Bert Marcus, the director of the documentary The American Meme , echoed that sentiment, remarking that she \"paved the way for creating a brand and a celebrity out of being herself and she turned it into a phenomenon,\" while Instagram celebrity and entrepreneur The Fat Jew, who was one of the subjects in the aforementioned documentary, credited her for \"inventing the way the world thinks about influence\". Galore magazine named her \"the Original Reality TV Business Queen\" and featured her in its Art Issue 2017. Indeed, her fame made her a leading figure in the early 2000s popularization of reality television into mainstream pop culture. Vice, in a 2015 profile, noted that after The Simple Life premiered in 2003, \"cable channels began programming reality television shows. MTV's second golden age consisted of The Hills; Andy Cohen reinvented Bravo with a repertoire of The Real Housewives, and TLC started teaching Americans about Dance Moms and Honey Boo Boo\". Dazed once considered that every \"[reality] star who cashes in after the series by collaborating with brands is essentially selling a sort of post-Hilton aspirational glamour\". The Kardashian family, Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, Tila Tequila, Danielle Staub, Alexa Chung, Brittny Gastineau, and Snooki are some of the personalities who are said to have followed in her footsteps. Kim Kardashian acknowledged Hilton for \"giving\" her a career, while Tana Mongeau stated that the media personality \"paved the way for me. A girl like me who is literally famous for nothing \u2014Paris Hilton taught us how to make that a business, you know what I mean\". Despite the public's overall negative perception on her, Hilton is considered an American pop culture icon. The height of her fame coincided with and contributed to the growth of what The New York Times described as a \"misogynist\" and intrusive celebrity culture, dominated by tabloids and paparazzi. By the turn of the 21st century, society had been noted to be fixated on celebrity in \"a way that it had never been before\", and with the internet becoming a more accessible medium, Hilton's media ubiquity ultimately proved highly beneficial for the press in general. For instance, a paparazzi photograph of her, at that time, could range from US$8,000 to US$1 million,  celebrity-focused newspapers and media agencies attributed their large viewership to their coverage on Hilton, and a network of gossip blogs such as PerezHilton.com emerged after she rose to fame. The clothing style that defined her image in her heyday \u2014Juicy Couture tracksuits, rhinestones, Von Dutch trucker hats and even \"the accessory dog\"\u2014 have become popular fashion trends. The Julien Macdonald dress Hilton wore for her 21st birthday has been recreated numerous times and she was part of the revival of Juicy Couture in 2017, even attending their Spring/Summer 2018 presentation at New York Fashion Week. People magazine wrote in a March 2017 article: \"For millennials, Paris Hilton has always been and will always be a living legend. The socialite has come to perfectly define not only the millennial fashion aesthetic, but also a bygone era of celebrity where social media was nonexistent, as were stylists, and getting papped while partying was simply de rigueur\" . Hilton has been discussed by journalists and scholars interested in the role of celebrities and their influence through the media. Feminist theorist Camille Paglia described her as a \"groundbreaking\" figure in Hollywood, while in her book The Bling Ring, an account on the group of thieves who robbed Hilton's house, Nancy Jo Sales positioned her as a \"celebrity symbol of how destructive individualism ruled the 2000s\". On August 29, 2006, the mayor of Las Vegas proclaimed the day \"Paris Hilton Day\" and gave Hilton a key to the city. Her quote, \"Dress cute wherever you go; life is too short to blend in\", was added to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations in September 2009.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber , changing her story again and the thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking a map and a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes , to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays on the dining room table. As Don prepares to return to the office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation. Charlie develops the model needed to find the rapist and refines it with graduate student Amita Ramanujan's assistance. Charlie's model yields what he calls a \"hot zone\", an area in which the suspect probably lives. As the case progresses, Silber is found dead in her house. Don and his team resort to comparing DNA samples of men who live in the hot zone to samples of the rapist/killer. Using statistical analysis, Charlie deduces that Silber lied about where her rape took place. After Don learns from Silber's colleagues where Silber was raped, Charlie refines his equation, which yields a smaller area within the original hot zone. DNA, however, clears everyone in the original hot zone. As a result, Assistant Director in Charge Walter Merrick pulls Don and his team from the investigation. At the same time, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt , Charlie's colleague and friend, encourages Charlie to make his equation \"less elegant\" and to evaluate the worth of his consultation work. Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don discuss what went wrong. Alan is confident that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where he spends most of his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim, who is still alive. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier.

In 1990, Hill's wife, Hildy Gottlieb, had left her job as an agent to head up Alec Baldwin's production company, Meadowbrook Productions. Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford. According to Baldwin, Hill always wanted to film his original script of The Getaway before it had been changed by Sam Peckinpah. Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other. And when mistrust occurs, it breeds violence and havoc.\" Basinger says her views were incorporated into rewrites of the script by Amy Jones. She liked them and accepted the role. Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\". According to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the pageand spaceseparating the columns. John Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation , but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\". Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The majority of scholars consider the compilation of these books to go back to the Persian period, 538\u2013332\u00a0BCE, but based on earlier written and oral traditions. There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the Jewish apocrypha and in the genre of rabbinical exegesis known as Midrash, as well as in the primary works of the Jewish oral law, the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition. The Midrash identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names. Moses's other names were Jekuthiel , Heber , Jered , Avi Zanoah , Avi Gedor , Avi Soco , Shemaiah ben Nethanel . Moses is also attributed the names Toviah , and Levi , Heman, Mechoqeiq and Ehl Gav Ish . In another exegesis, Moses had ascended to the first heaven until the seventh, even visited Paradise and Hell alive, after he saw the Divine vision in Mount Horeb. Jewish historians who lived at Alexandria, such as Eupolemus, attributed to Moses the feat of having taught the Phoenicians their alphabet, similar to legends of Thoth. Artapanus of Alexandria explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/Hermes, but also with the Greek figure Musaeus , and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres. Jewish tradition considers Moses to be the greatest prophet who ever lived. Despite his importance, Judaism stresses that Moses was a human being, and is therefore not to be worshipped. Only God is worthy of worship in Judaism.

Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis , Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima , and Fluorescences , were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters. By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character. Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\" The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the Academy's kitchen, Myrtle watches as Cordelia drops some eggs in an attempt to make breakfast. She asks Cordelia if she believes Myrtle blinded her. Myrtle recounts the day when young Cordelia first arrived at the Academy when Cordelia asked if Myrtle was now her mother. Cordelia knows Myrtle did not harm her. Hank arrives at Delphi Trust in Atlanta, Georgia. With his father and David, he discusses the orders given to him to act as an information gatherer, not as a witch hunter. Hank is frustrated with his role and claims a successful hunt on his own. His father calls Hank sloppy, explaining how that \"success\" actually required his father to \"clean up\" the murder of Kaylee. Hank is shocked to learn that Delphi was behind the attack on Cordelia. His father reminds Hank that one day Cordelia will have to be \"put down.\" At the Academy, Myrtle prepares for a meeting with the Council of Witchcraft. Quentin and Cecily express regret over the \"misunderstanding\" that led to Myrtle's death, but marvel at her healed scars and ask about Misty's mud.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.

But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

{"id": "91_835", "question": "What genre is Visitors?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24563", "text": "As the \"first true megamusical\", Cats pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals\u00a0\u2014 including Les Mis\u00e9rables , The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon \u2014 that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained: Cats introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting\u00a0\u2014 and then aggressively promoting\u00a0\u2014 a single recognisable image as the face of the show. The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline to create what The Daily Telegraph called \"one of musical theatre's greatest posters\". Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for Les Mis\u00e9rables and the Phantom's mask for The Phantom of the Opera. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called \"critic-proof\" status of megamusicals. Additionally, Cats was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official Cats t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry. Beyond the megamusical, Cats also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: \"Cats is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped. People do want a theatrical experience for their children.\" Thanks to its easily accessible spectacle, the original Broadway production also tapped into the then-burgeoning tourist boom in New York and its audience shifted increasingly towards foreign visitors in its later years. Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to Cats, citing the latter's disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience. The musical's fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey's pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an \"architectural manner\", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of Cats was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre. Cats opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote: In the 1980s, the success of local productions of Cats in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit. The musical was also a boon for the Broadway touring industry. In 1997, The New York Times credited the regional and touring productions of Cats with \"almost single-handedly reviv[ing] the sagging road business\". Cats revolutionised the touring business by introducing the now commonplace practice of extended touring engagements that can last several weeks or months in a single city, as opposed to the typical one-week or ten-day tour stop. Mackintosh's insistence that all touring productions of Cats replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical's demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Game Informer listed Fahrenheit last among ten video game openings. Garnett Lee of 1Up.com praised the \"disturbing\" and graceful nature of the story as well as its combination with the gameplay, saying Fahrenheit had set a new standard for future aims of doing so. GameSpots Alex Navarro highlighted the layers of context and \"heartfelt meaning\" to its use of cinematic gameplay. He enjoyed the narrative, dubbing it \"deep, captivating\", and, echoing Lee, \"disturbing\". The character development, art style, voice acting, and music also saw approval from Navarro. Raymond M. Padilla at GameSpy declared that \"it's so good that it just might save a dying genre\", regarding the plot and main characters to be well-written and the voice cast as one of the best of the year. The controls were admired for their accessibility, while the score was complimented for its \"moody and captivating\" qualities. Writing for GameZone, Ronnie Hobbs liked that the controls helped with narrative immersion, and that this created an emotional connection to the characters.

{"id": "91_841", "question": "What genre is The House of God?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_36005", "text": "The four canonical gospels are the foremost sources for the life and message of Jesus. But other parts of the New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26. Acts of the Apostles refers to Jesus' early ministry and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1-11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the Gospels, Jesus' words or instructions are cited several times. Some early Christian groups had separate descriptions of Jesus' life and teachings that are not in the New Testament. These include the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these were written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels. The canonical gospels are four accounts, each by a different author. The authors of the Gospels are all anonymous, attributed by tradition to the four evangelists, each with close ties to Jesus: Mark by John Mark, an associate of Peter; Matthew by one of Jesus' disciples; Luke by a companion of Paul mentioned in a few epistles; and John by another of Jesus' disciples, the \"beloved disciple\". One important aspect of the study of the Gospels is the literary genre under which they fall. Genre \"is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings\". Whether the gospel authors set out to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted. Some recent studies suggest that the genre of the Gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient biography. Although not without critics, the position that the Gospels are a type of ancient biography is the consensus among scholars today. Concerning the accuracy of the accounts, viewpoints run the gamut from considering them inerrant descriptions of Jesus' life, to doubting whether they are historically reliable on a number of points, to considering them to provide very little historical information about his life beyond the basics. According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels are the most reliable sources of information about Jesus. According to the Marcan priority, the first to be written was the Gospel of Mark , followed by the Gospel of Matthew , the Gospel of Luke , and the Gospel of John . Most scholars agree that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source for their gospels. Since Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark, many scholars assume that they used another source in addition to Mark. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the Synoptic Gospels, from the Greek \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd and \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 , because they are similar in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure, and one can easily set them next to each other and synoptically compare what is in them. Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John. While the flow of some events are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in John, which also differs on other matters, such as the Cleansing of the Temple. The Synoptics emphasize different aspects of Jesus. In Mark, Jesus is the Son of God whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of God's Kingdom. He is a tireless wonder worker, the servant of both God and man. This short gospel records few of Jesus' words or teachings. The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes that Jesus is the fulfillment of God's will as revealed in the Old Testament, and the Lord of the Church. He is the \"Son of David\", a \"king\", and the messiah. Luke presents Jesus as the divine-human savior who shows compassion to the needy. He is the friend of sinners and outcasts, come to seek and save the lost. This gospel includes well-known parables, such as the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. The prologue to the Gospel of John identifies Jesus as an incarnation of the divine Word . As the Word, Jesus was eternally present with God, active in all creation, and the source of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more. In general, the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in John 21:25, the Gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in Jesus' life. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of Jesus' life in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. The Gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, but it is possible to draw from them a general picture of Jesus' life story.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin , the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn , while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films. Following the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond\u00a0... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere. The 24 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 26 Bond films have grossed over $7.04\u00a0billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\". Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart. Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps. The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in S\u00f6lden at 10,000\u00a0ft above sea level.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Those failing to show enthusiasm for the cause are gruesomely blown to pieces. In the first scene, a bright and chirpy schoolteacher, played by Lyndsey Marshal, tells her class about the 10:10 campaign, and asks what they are doing to reduce their carbon footprint. She asks which students are planning to participate; most raise their hands, but two children shrug apathetically. The teacher reassures them that this is \"fine, it's absolutely fine, it's your choice\" and there is \"no pressure\", but then shifts the papers on her desk to reveal a red-buttoned detonator, which she presses. The two children who did not want to participate explode, covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts. The blood-spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain the night's homework to her horrified charges. The second scene shows a group of white-collar workers in an office meeting. The office manager, played by Paul Ritter, similarly explains the purpose of the 10:10 campaign, and asks who will be participating. While most raise their hands, four raise their hands unconvinced. The manager reassures them that there is \"no pressure\" to participate, but he is then handed a detonator by an assistant, which he uses to blow up the four workers, splattering appalled co-workers with gore. The third scene is set on a football pitch during team training. The coach, played by David Ginola, asks the players to explain the 10:10 campaign that the team is participating in. They describe a range of energy-saving measures which have been implemented by the team and its fans. However, the coach remains unmoved, remarking the campaign would distract him from football. A player tells him that there's \"no pressure\", produces a detonator, and blows him up. Unlike the witnesses depicted in previous scenes, the team is not at all surprised, and casually jogs away to resume training. A brief interlude with captions explains the campaign, accompanied by music from Radiohead. In the final scene, the actress Gillian Anderson is finishing the voice-over for the interlude just seen. The sound engineer asks her what she is planning to do to cut her carbon footprint. Anderson irritably remarks that she thought providing the recording was a sufficient contribution. The sound engineer repeats the film's catchphrase, \"no pressure\", and detonates Anderson before picking up to leave. The film ends with a shot of Anderson's gory remains sliding down the sound-booth window with the text \"Cut your carbon by 10%. No pressure.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Picking up where the first film left off, the film sees Daniel accompany Miyagi on a trip to Okinawa, where he is reunited with loved ones and is challenged by an old adversary. Although a commercial success, it received mixed reviews. The Karate Kid Part III followed in 1989, which saw Kreese seek revenge on Daniel and Miyagi with the help of new allies. It was criticized for rehashing elements of the first two films. Another sequel, The Next Karate Kid , was the first in the series not to include Macchio, although Morita returned as Miyagi. It follows Hilary Swank as one of his new students. A remake of the original film, also titled The Karate Kid, was released in 2010. Set in Beijing, it starred Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith and received generally favorable reviews. Aside from the film series, an animated series based on the film, also called The Karate Kid, aired on NBC in the fall of 1989. Consisting of thirteen episodes, the series abandoned the karate tournament motif and followed Daniel and Miyagi, voiced by Joey Dedio and Robert Ito, respectively, in an adventure/quest setting. A sequel live-action television series, Cobra Kai, debuted in 2018. Created by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, it stars Macchio and Zabka, who reprise their roles as LaRusso and Lawrence, respectively. Set 34 years later, Cobra Kai re-examines the \"Miyagi-Verse\" narrative from Johnny's point of view, his decision to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo, and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel. The series draws upon all of the sequels, as well as the original film. The series also pays tribute to Morita, who died in 2005. After a guest appearance in the show's first season, Kove reprised his role as John Kreese starting in the second season, while Shue reprised her role as Ali Mills in the series' third season.

{"id": "91_848", "question": "What genre is Egg?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_70722", "text": "O'Bannon introduced Scott to the artwork of H. R. Giger; both of them felt that his painting Necronom IV was the type of representation they wanted for the film's antagonist and began asking the studio to hire him as a designer. 20th Century Fox initially believed Giger's work was too ghastly for audiences, but the Brandywine team were persistent and eventually won out. According to Gordon Carroll: \"The first second that Ridley saw Giger's work, he knew that the biggest single design problem, maybe the biggest problem in the film, had been solved.\" Scott flew to Z\u00fcrich to meet Giger and recruited him to work on all aspects of the Alien and its environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict spacecraft, and all four forms of the Alien from the egg to the adult. The scene of Kane inspecting the egg was shot in postproduction. A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves. The top of the egg was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason, the image of a hen's egg was used on the poster, and has become emblematic of the franchise as a whole\u2014as opposed to the Alien egg that appears in the finished film. The \"facehugger\" and its proboscis, which was made of a sheep's intestine, were shot out of the egg using high-pressure air hoses. The shot was reversed and slowed down in editing to prolong the effect and reveal more detail. The facehugger itself was the first creature that H.R. Giger designed for the film, going through several versions in different sizes before deciding on a small creature with human-like fingers and a long tail. Dan O'Bannon, with help from Ron Cobb, drew his own version based on Giger's design, which became the final version. Cobb came up with the idea that the creature could have a powerful acid for blood, a characteristic that would carry over to the adult Alien and would make it impossible for the crew to kill it by conventional means, such as guns or explosives, since the acid would burn through the ship's hull. For the scene in which the dead facehugger is examined, Scott used pieces of fish and shellfish to create its viscera. The design of the \"chestburster\" was inspired by Francis Bacon's 1944 painting Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. Giger's original design, which was refined, resembled a plucked chicken. Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon credits his experiences with Crohn's disease for inspiring the chest-busting scene. For the filming of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the creature would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but they had not been told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest, a stream of blood shot directly at Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt, \"What you saw on camera was the real response. She had no idea what the hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up.\" The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to go through and passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about. The real-life surprise of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made it one of the film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings, the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater so as not to be too close to the screen during the sequence. The scene has frequently been called one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking it above the decapitation scene in The Omen and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London . For the scene in which Ash is revealed to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body, which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and reactivated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing and the result was not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and Foley's Urinary Catheters were combined to form the android's innards.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: \"Kinda? I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years. But at the same time, we have amazing fans around the world so I can't say 'the world's unluckiest band', but what I can say is 'the world's luckiest band'. Thanks to our fans.\" The group was popular among rebellious youths, who were attracted to, as Asiaweek put it, \"the tone of alienation and frustration for which X was revered.\" Their music was described by Asiaweek as having \"an angry sound that rejected the cookie-cutter principles of Japanese society.\" In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained \"In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans: they dress like it, they breathe it.\" In the documentary Global Metal, Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them, \"but eventually we sold 20 million albums, so they had no choice\". X Japan has also been named one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent record label. In 1990, they won the \"Grand Prix New Artist of the Year\" award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards. HMV Japan ranked the band number 40 on a 2003 list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts, and in 2010 they came in third in a poll by Oricon on which Japanese bands people want around for future generations. In 2011, Consequence of Sound named X Japan one of their Top 15 Cult Acts. In April 2012, X Japan won the Revolver Golden Gods Award for \"Best International Artist\". They were awarded \"Most Devoted Fans\" in the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards on January 17, 2013, and won the poll again two years later on February 3, 2015. Later that year, they also won the website's Best Live Band Tournament in August, beating out Pearl Jam in the final round. LA Weekly ranked X Japan tenth on an October 2014 list of the 10 Best Prog Metal Bands. In March 2017, Loudwire named X Japan the Best Metal Band from Japan writing that \"their high-octane power metal and exhilarating live show make them the pinnacle of heavy music in the 'Land of the Rising Sun'.\" However, X Japan has also made a mark outside of the music industry. In 1999, at the request of the Japanese government, Yoshiki composed and performed a classical song for Japan's Emperor Akihito at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of his enthronement. Japan's former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is a well-known fan of the band. His political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, even used X Japan's song \"Forever Love\" in several commercials in 2001. It was also reported that Koizumi was influential in getting the Hide Museum opened in Yokosuka in 2000. Yoshiki stated he loved \"the punkish elements\" of the albums Iron Maiden and Killers by Iron Maiden. He also cited Sex Pistols, the Clash, GBH, and Chaos UK as favorite bands.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature.

Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.

But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics.

{"id": "91_881", "question": "What genre is Collaboration West?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_30860", "text": "Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\". His method of sampling technique is reminiscent of record production from the 1990s, involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs. According to mixing engineer Craig Bauer, the co-owner of Hinge Studios, a downtown Chicago recording and mixing facility where West has been a client, \"He knew what he wanted, and he was always striving to make his beats sound like no one else's. He would lift samples and manipulate them\u2014twist them around, turn them up an octave\u2014until he got something fresh out of something that was made twenty or thirty years ago. He never wanted to be like someone else.\" This is typically done on an Akai MPC or an Ensoniq ASR-10 and combined with his own instrumentation. West further developed his style on his debut studio album, The College Dropout . On the album, West formed the constitutive elements of his style: intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. After a rough version was leaked, West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming. Alongside soul samples, the record was characterized by its relatable lyrics. West drew from his own experiences after leaving college to pursue music and recovering from a near-fatal car accident. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects. His songs found him rapping about higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, and his own self-doubts and personal struggles in the music industry in a manner particular to his middle-class upbringing. West progressed forward towards more musically adventurous, maximalistic production on his subsequent albums, beginning with his sophomore effort, Late Registration . For his second album, West collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion and drew influence from diverse influences such as English trip hop group Portishead. Blending West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, the album experimentally incorporated a wide array of different genres and prominent orchestral elements, including string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs, amid a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments. Critic Robert Christgau wrote that \"there's never been hip-hop so complex and subtle musically\". In addition, West's flow improved since his debut album. He became more adept at syncing his phrases up with beats instead of merely coasting over them to deliver punch lines. With his lyrics, West displayed an aptitude for personalizing what would otherwise be political, dwelling on matters close to heart. On his third album, Graduation , West moved towards and atmospheric soundscape influenced by rock music, electronics, and europop\u2014with all three influences on display in the album's break-out single \"Stronger\" which prominently features Daft Punk's \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". West retracted much of the soulful sampling and rich live instrumentation that characterized his previous albums and replaced them with loud, gothic synthesizers. He incorporated layers of distorted synth-chords, house beats, electro-disco rhythms, and a wide array of modulated electronic noises and digital audio-effects into his hip-hop production. West was primarily influenced by arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones, U2 and Led Zeppelin. Drawing from his experiences on stadium tours, West progressed to a more anthemic style of composing rap songs that would function well when performing in large arenas. He also drew musical inspiration from European Britpop and Euro-disco, American alternative and indie-rock, and his native Chicago house. Lyrically, Graduation is more introspective in comparison to predecessors. West dedicated much of his songwriting towards providing inspirational messages directed at individuals while exploring personal issues surrounding his own fame and media scrutiny. West's fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak , marked a radical departure from his previous releases. He largely abandoned rapping over hip-hop beats in favor of emotive, melodic singing within a stark synth-driven electropop soundscape. West stripped away samples and relied almost entirely on droning synthesizers as instruments while singing with the use of Auto-Tune. Throughout the album, he juxtaposes the electronic feel generated by Auto-Tune and distorted Roland TR-808 drum machine with lengthy strings, somber piano and tribal rhythms. Impacted by the death of his mother, Donda West, as well as the broken engagement from his fianc\u00e9e, designer Alexis Phifer, he wrote more sensitive pop songs about love and relationships. West was inspired to sing thanks to words of encouragement from famed pop artist Michael Jackson. Prior to its release, West also cited inspiration from 1980s synthpop artists such as Phil Collins, Gary Numan, and Boy George and confessed an affinity with the work of post-punk and new wave groups such as Joy Division, The Police and TJ Swan. He would later describe 808s & Heartbreak as \"the first black new wave album\". Discussing the album's subsequent influence on popular music, journalist Matthew Trammell for Rolling Stone described 808s as \"Kanye's most vulnerable work, and perhaps his most brilliant\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Winslet was hand-picked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give , Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances. Cameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz' performance in the film to Goldie Hawn, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said. Jude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\" and single father raising his two daughters by himself after his wife's death. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday. Jack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend Ethan. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock . On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\" Eli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set, that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man. The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale together, although they do not share a scene.  The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair. Dustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate . According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster for a movie, saw all the light and came over to see what was going on. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it. Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers' remake of The Parent Trap , and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday. Veteran voiceover talent Hal Douglas was the narrator for the trailer, as well as other \"trailers\" that describe Amanda's situation at various points in the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the game, players take control of a single character from one of three humanoid races to either complete the story in single-player mode or to challenge other players in online multiplayer matches. They can select heavily armed Meccaryns equipped with jet packs, or amphibious spell-casting Sea Reapers; the game's subtitle, \"Citizen Kabuto\", refers to the last selectable race, a thundering behemoth who can execute earthshaking wrestling attacks to pulverize its enemies. The single-player mode is framed as a sequential story, putting the player through a series of missions, several of which test the player's reflexes in action game-like puzzles. Game critics praised Giants for its state-of-the-art graphics on Windows computers, a humorous story, and successfully blending different genres. Criticisms focused on crippling software bugs and the lack of an in-game save feature.

According to the aggregate review website Metacritic, Living Things holds a score of 60 out of 100 based on 15 collected reviews, indicating \"mixed to average reviews.\" Chad Childers of Loudwire stated that \"the album as a whole continues to expand their world-view writing like what listeners got with A Thousand Suns, but it also adds more of the anger that was prevalent in their earliest work, Hybrid Theory.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic declared that \"there is definition to their structure, some of the choruses catch hold without too much effort -- but this album remains one of sustained mood, not individual moments\" and concludes that the album is \"a fitting soundtrack for aging rap-rockers who are comfortable in their skin but restless at heart\". The Guardian writer Dave Simpson observed that \"Living Things is more personal than A Thousand Suns, with underlying themes of recovery from traumatic experiences. The exception, Burn It Down, delivers an antiwar sentiment via Depeche Mode-y electro-bounce, while the similarly standout Roads Untraveled is an eerie confessional ballad\", and concluded that \"Living Things would have benefited from more of such adventure, but they still sound like a band enjoying an unexpected second life\". Johan Wippsson of Melodic wrote that the album is \"too little too pop-oriented and made for the charts than before. The synthesizers are a bit too intent to Coldplay mode, but assume that the band felt it was time to conquer the charts again.\" PopMatters' Jordan Blum concluded that \u201cLiving Things is a very good entry that\u2019s simply not as special as its precursor.\" Phil Mongredien from The Observer comments on their refusal to play it safe and praises their boldness. Tim Grierson at About.com stated that Living Things is \"a straightforward collection that plays to their rap-rock strengths, and while it\u2019s often musically engaging, these 12 songs don\u2019t have enough cumulative impact. As a result, the record ends up being a diverting experience rather than an arresting one.\" At The A.V. Club, Evan Rytlewski commented that the band \"can dial down the heaviness all it wants, recruit the most Grammy-proven producers, and keep current with the latest electronic textures, but those moves can only take Linkin Park so far when its songs have all the emotional range of an MMA bout\". Another mixed review from Hamish MacBain at NME stated that \"...their foray into said genre here is restricted to the three minutes of \u2018Castle of Glass\u2019. The rest is... well, to be fair, they've obviously been listening to a bit of Skrillex, and thus the heavy guitar thud of yore has been replaced by a new, heavy electronic thud, but that aside it's largely the usual semi-hilarious histrionica to which we\u2019ve become accustomed.\" MacBain also added that, in the sub-description of the review, the album is \"A predictable earache\".", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_889", "question": "What genre is Epidemic?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_45699", "text": "Epidemic was formed in 1986 in Palo Alto by bassist Mark Bodine, guitarist Guy Higbey, guitarist Erik Moggridge, and their friend Ted Kamp on drums to play the senior night talent show at their high school. After playing a set of two songs and enjoying the experience, the guys decided to continue and pursue the band full-time taking the Epidemic name from the Slayer song. After recruiting drummer Geoff Bruce and vocalist Carl Fulli to complete the lineup, the band entered a Battle of the Bands contest held at the Mountain View Theater in September 1987.  Having only recruited Fulli a couple of weeks prior, and having no previous experience, the band had no real expectations of winning the contest.  After the first night of competition the band had reached the finals and subsequently won the competition the next night. They won an opening slot for Death Angel the following month. The band recorded their first demo, \"Immortal Minority\", in December 1987.  Achieving minor success in the Bay Area and playing almost every thrash show at the Mountain View Theater, with the likes of Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Death Angel, D.R.I., etc. the band started to branch out further, playing shows at the Stone in San Francisco and the Omni in Oakland. In the fall of 1988, Epidemic came to the conclusion that they needed a drummer with further advanced double kick skills and Bruce agreed to leave the band. They recruited Bobby Cochran, a longtime friend and former Punisher drummer, to take over duties. With this line-up, Epidemic went into Telluride Studios in Palo Alto to record their demo, \"Demo '89\".  The band initially gave out 300 free demos after a Vio-lence show at the Omni and their popularity grew tremendously. The band sent out the demo to many magazines, radio stations and labels and created a name for themselves globally.  The band estimates that they sold roughly 5,000-7,000 demos on their own over the next two years. During this time the band was able to headline venues on their own. Epidemic's first headline show at the Stone was filled at 90% capacity. They also reached agreement with Marco Barbieri, who years later would become the head of the label Century Media Records, to become their manager. In addition, a deal was reached with Metalcore Records in Europe for the release of \"Demo '89\" on CD and vinyl. It would be the first official CD released by the band under the title The Truth of What Will Be, though it was only released in Europe. In January 1991, the band recorded another demo, titled \"Extremities '91\", which led to their signing of a record contract with Metal Blade Records. The band recorded their United States debut album, Decameron, at HOS studios in Palo Alto. The album was released in the summer of 1992. The band went on a two-week East Coast tour with Malevolent Creation and Suffocation in December 1992 to support it, and eight weeks later headed out on a nationwide tour with Cannibal Corpse and Unleashed in early 1993. Epidemic gained considerable exposure as well as experience, as this was what they thought was the beginning of their touring years. After coming home from the tours the band focused on writing new material but asked Higbey to leave the band. This was a difficult decision for the band but they moved forward as a four-piece and continued to write and prepare for their next album. Entering Razor's Edge studios in San Francisco in the fall of 1993, the band recorded their album, Exit Paradise, which was released in October 1994. The band decided to break up a couple months after the release of this album  due to differences in the band and the label's lack of support. In 2011 Divebomb Records approached the band to release all of the band's demos as a single release on CD. The subsequent release called \"Pandemic the Demo Anthology\" was released in the summer of 2012. In 2014 the band was notified that a label from Massachusetts called The Crypt acquired the rights to license the band's first album for Metal Blade, Decameron, and will release it on gate fold vinyl in the first half of 2015.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rock star whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society forms a figurative wall. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time and one of the band's finest works. Bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In The Flesh tour, modelling the character of Pink after himself and former bandmate Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. Producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band members were struggling with personal and financial issues at the time. The Wall was the last album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet; keyboardist Richard Wright was fired by Waters during production but stayed on as a salaried musician. Three singles were issued from the album: \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" , \"Run Like Hell\", and \"Comfortably Numb\". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects.  In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature film for which Waters wrote the screenplay. The Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second best-selling album in the band's catalogue and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were used on the group's next album, The Final Cut . In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stones lists of the greatest albums of all time. From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new Wall live tour that became the highest-grossing tour by a solo musician.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Gene Siskel, film critic with the Chicago Tribune also enjoyed the movie, awarding it three stars out of four and calling it \"a decent enough low-budget horror film that delivers what audiences have every reason to expect - a funny, horrific grossout\". William Wolf with the Gannett News Service rated the film half-a-star out of four. He criticized the movie for its strong gore content as well as the sado-masochistic treatment of women. In his review Wolf wrote, \"The gore gets progressively more stomach-turning without much cleverness, and after a while From Beyond just becomes overkill, more revolting than scary or funny.\" AllMovie's review of the film was favorable, writing \"Gordon is that rare breed who truly finds inspiration in another creator and uses that inspiration to craft a film that captures the essence of that creator while still being totally and uniquely his own\", calling it a \"gory thrill ride of a movie.\" The film score by Richard Band won the award for Best Original Soundtrack at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival in Sitges, Spain. In their book Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P.

His father was successful in business as a silversmith and jeweler and was a director at several financial firms. His mother's brother was Adrian Janes, who owned an iron foundry that constructed the U.S. Capitol Dome. The family's wealth allowed Frederic to pursue his interest in art from a very early age.

Nolan has denied that the film criticizes the Occupy movement, and insists that none of his Batman films are intended to be political: \"I've had as many conversations with people who have seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' \u2013 well, obviously, that's not true.\" Alternatively, politically-conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh alleged that the film was biased against 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney due to Bane's name being a homophone for Bain Capital, the financial service company Romney used to head, despite the fact that the character has existed as a major Batman foe since 1993. In response, Nolan said that the comments were \"bizarre\", while Dixon and Freeman said that the comments were \"ridiculous\". Democratic adviser Christopher Lehane has noted the similarities between the narratives of the film and the presidential campaign. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek argued that film was inspired by the French Revolution as portrayed by novelist Charles Dickens.

{"id": "91_900", "question": "What genre is Infected?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_12610", "text": "The central theme of The Thing concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions. Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diaboliques Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that MacReady destroys the chess computer after being checkmated, and similarly vows to destroy the Thing, even at the expense of the team. The Cold War-style isolationism hurts the group, while a lack of trust destroys it. Screen Rants Michael Edward Taylor draws allusions between The Thing and the accusatory Red Scares and McCarthyism, as the film conveys an anti-communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation. Slant Magazines John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War \"fatigued counterculturalism\"\u2014the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities. Lancaster's script eschews female characters because he believed that a female character would be a love interest who inevitably gets in the way. The Atlantics Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, females are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. Indeed, several assimilations involve penetration, tentacles, and in Norris's case, opened up at the stomach to birth his own replica. The slasher genre favors female stars as they are perceived as weaker and therefore more empathetic, providing a cathartic release when they defeat the villain, but in The Thing the men are not meant to survive. Vices Patrick Marlborough considered The Thing to be a critical take on masculinity. Identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but masculinity prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other. Nerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizonss Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror, the notion that ancient, inhuman beings exist that do not care about humanity in any way. This also includes the fear of losing one's humanity, and being consumed, figuratively or literally, by these ancient eldritch behemoths. The Thing is a being beyond our understanding and possesses the ability to destroy all life on Earth quickly. Just as Lovecraft left his creatures undescribed, the Thing can be seen, but its shape is mostly indescribable, beyond the realm of human knowledge. Grey said that MacReady represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist, but Blair represents the Lovecraftian protagonist, who succumbs to his fear of the creature, is driven insane by the implications of its nature, and eventually becomes what he fears. The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self. It attacks, consumes and imitates an individual perfectly with memories and behaviors. The original is subsumed by an alien copy that is virtually impossible to identify. Den of Geeks Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\" Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could only be identified by a blood test. Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming. During production, Carpenter considered having MacReady be infected, and an alternate ending showed MacReady having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected. Russell has said that analyzing the scene for clues is \"missing the point\". He continued, \"[Carpenter] and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn't know anything... They didn't know if they knew who they were... I love that, over the years, that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past the horrificness of the monster... to see what the movie was about, which was paranoia.\" However, Carpenter has teased, \"Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the 1990s, Evan Dando's group The Lemonheads recorded \"Frank Mills\" for their 1992 album It's a Shame About Ray, and Run DMC sampled \"Where Do I Go\" for their 1993 single \"Down With the King\" which went to  on the Billboard rap charts and reached the top 25 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.  In 2004 \"Aquarius\", from the 1979 film version, was honored at number\u00a033 on AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Songs. Songs from the musical have been featured in films and television episodes.  For example, in the 2005 film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the character Willy Wonka welcomed the children with lyrics from \"Good Morning Starshine\". \"Aquarius\" was performed in the final episode of Laverne and Shirley in 1983, where the character Carmine moves to New York City to become an actor, and auditions for Hair.  \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" was also performed in the final scene in the film The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Three Dog Night's recording of \"Easy to Be Hard\" was featured in the first part of David Fincher's film Zodiac. On the Simpsons episode \"The Springfield Files\", the townspeople, Leonard Nimoy, Chewbacca, Dana Scully and Fox Mulder all sing \"Good Morning Starshine\". The episode \"Hairography\" of the show Glee includes a much-criticized mash-up of the songs \"Hair\" and \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyonc\u00e9. In addition, Head of the Class featured a two-part episode in 1990 where the head of the English department is determined to disrupt the school's performance of Hair. The continued popularity of Hair is seen in its number ten ranking in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the \"[United Kingdom]'s Number One Essential Musicals\". Because of the universality of its pacifist theme, Hair continues to be a popular choice for high-school and university productions. Amateur productions of Hair are also popular worldwide. In 2002, Peter Jennings featured a Boulder, Colorado, high school production of Hair for his ABC documentary series In Search of America. A September 2006 community theater production at the 2,000-seat Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, was praised by original producer Michael Butler, who said it was \"one of the best Hairs I have seen in a long time.\"  Another example of a recent large-scale amateur production is the Mountain Play production at the 4,000-seat Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre in Mount Tamalpais State Park in Mill Valley, California, in the spring of 2007. Legacy Hair was Broadway's \"first fully realized\" concept musical, a form that dominated the musical theatre of the seventies, including shows like Company, Follies, Pacific Overtures and A Chorus Line. While the development of the concept musical was an unexpected consequence of Hair tenure on Broadway, the expected rock music revolution on Broadway turned out to be less than complete. MacDermot followed Hair with three successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona ; Dude , a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica . While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteen\u00a0performances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. According to Horn, these and other such \"failures may have been the result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard to the quality of the material presented\". Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell were two religiously themed successes of the genre. Grease reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz were heavily influenced by gospel, R&B and soul music. By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls and Little Shop of Horrors , audience tastes in the 1980s turned to megamusicals with pop scores, like Les Mis\u00e9rables and The Phantom of the Opera . Some later rock musicals, such as Rent and Spring Awakening , as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You and Rock of Ages , have found success. But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. Critic Clive Barnes commented, \"There really weren't any rock musicals. No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ...  You might think of the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why. There's so much more money in records and rock concerts. I mean, why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia?\"Subsequent to Barnes' comment, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark began performances in 2010, with a rock score by Bono, but the musical suffered a series of mishaps, record expenses and tepid reviews. See, e.g., Pennacchio, George. \"Spider-Man musical opens: What critics said\". . ABClocal-KABC, June 14, 2011. On the other hand, Hair had a profound effect not only on what was acceptable on Broadway, but as part of the very social movements that it celebrated. For example, in 1970, Butler, Castelli and the various Hair casts contributed to fundraising for the World Youth Assembly, a United Nations\u2013sponsored organization formed in connection with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the United Nations. The Assembly enabled 750 young representatives from around the world to meet in New York in July 1970 to discuss social issues.\"Racusin Keys Trade Youth Drive of UN\". . Billboard, June 6, 1970, accessed April 19, 2011 For about a week, cast members worldwide collected donations at every show for the fund.  Hair raised around $250,000 and ended up being the principal financier of the Assembly. Cast and crew members also contributed a day's pay, and Butler contributed a day's profits from these productions. Moreover, as Ellen Stewart, La MaMa's founder, noted:", "hasanswer": false}]}

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona , but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior.

The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702. The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane. After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813. Thomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s. The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County. What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed. With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal.

Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany. Ono went on a musical hiatus following the release of Starpeace, until she signed with Rykodisc in 1992 and released the comprehensive six-disc box set Onobox. The box set included remastered highlights from Ono's solo albums and previously unreleased material from the 1974 \"lost weekend\" sessions. She also released a one-disc sampler of highlights from Onobox, simply titled Walking on Thin Ice. That year, she sat down for an extensive interview with music journalist Mark Kemp for a cover story in the alternative music magazine Option. The story took a revisionist look at Ono's music for a new generation of fans more accepting of her role as a pioneer in the merger of pop and the avant-garde. In 1994, Ono produced her own off-Broadway musical entitled New York Rock, which featured Broadway renditions of her songs. In 1995, she released Rising, a collaboration with her son Sean and his then-band, Ima. Rising spawned a world tour that traveled through Europe, Japan, and the United States. The following year, she collaborated with various alternative rock musicians for an EP entitled Rising Mixes. Guest remixers of Rising material included Cibo Matto, Ween, Tricky, and Thurston Moore. In 1997, Rykodisc reissued Ono's catalog of solo recordings on CD, from Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band through Starpeace. Ono and her engineer Rob Stevens personally remastered the audio, and various bonus tracks were added, including outtakes, demos, and live cuts. In the same year, Ono and the BMI Foundation established an annual music competition program for songwriters of contemporary musical genres to honor John Lennon's memory and his large creative legacy. Over $350,000 has been given through BMI Foundation's John Lennon Scholarships to talented young musicians in the United States, making it one of the most respected awards for emerging songwriters. In 2000, she founded the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan, which housed over 130 pieces of Lennon and Beatles memorabilia from Ono's private collection. The museum closed in 2010.

Early decisions made by the Arce administration as well as MAS itself indicated that Morales' influence in the party had declined. In late November and early December, MAS officials began the process of selecting party candidates to run in the upcoming March 2021 regional elections. In four departments , candidates for governor endorsed by Morales were not chosen by MAS officials. On 11 December, Morales tweeted Miguel \u201cChiquit\u00edn\u201d Becerra would be the MAS candidate for Governor of Pando. This was met by surprise by MAS officials in Pando as Becerra had not even entered the list of candidates voted on as he did not meet the minimum membership requirement of eight years in the party. Instead, Germ\u00e1n Richter had been chosen as the candidate 5 days prior on 7 December. On 14 December, MAS officials in Tarija and Santa Cruz proclaimed Rodolfo Meyer and Adriana Salvatierra as candidates for mayor of those cities before Morales had had the opportunity to arrive. The same day in the town of Lauca, Morales participated in a meeting to nominate a candidate for Governor of Santa Cruz. Though Morales initially endorsed former Mayor of Warnes Mario Cronenbold, he withdrew his support when Cronenbold made statements in favor of not prosecuting Luis Fernando Camacho, an anti-Morales activist. Instead, Morales endorsed former Minister of Government Carlos Romero as a candidate for governor. However, the announcement of the appointment of Romero was rejected by the meeting's participants with shouts calling for renewal. The discontent ultimately resulted in one person throwing a plastic chair at Morales in what was dubbed the \"silletazo.\" Morales blamed the incident on opposition party backers who infiltrated the rally. Half an hour later, Romero was withdrawn as a candidate and Morales announced television presenter Pedro Garc\u00eda as the new nominee. However, the following day MAS bases and grassroots social organizations ratified Mario Cronenbold as their candidate for governor in opposition to Garc\u00eda. The \"silletazo\" was met by various reactions within and outside of the party. Former UD Deputy Rafael Quispe affirmed that the event showed that Morales has \"finished his cycle and [...] should go home.\" Civic Community Senator Andrea Barrientos claimed that the incident proved that \"the people have lost their fear of Evo Morales,\" emphasizing that Morales' continued presence was a detriment not only to the country but to MAS as well. Segundina Flores, former MAS Deputy and executive of the Bartolina Sisa Confederation of Women, stated that Morales \"deserves respect\" and people \"cannot be bouncing around with chairs.\" However, she also pointed out that the picking of candidates should not be done by the pointing of a finger and that there must be transparency. As a result of these disputes, protesters in Potos\u00ed, El Alto, and Cochabamba expressed their disagreement with decisions that came out of meetings chaired by Morales. At a protest in El Alto on 15 December, MAS supporters rejected continued interference by Morales in the selection of candidates. \"Evo wants to nominate other people that not even the people have asked for, we will not allow that anymore.

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should. Mark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks. Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little\". King never hid his rejection of the final result of the film project, and accused Kubrick of not understanding the rules of the horror genre. King was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired the story . However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled The Shining, filmed at The Stanley Hotel. The animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the Bravo channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\". Nonetheless, writing in the afterword of Doctor Sleep, King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it \"...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember\u00a0\u2013 for reasons I have never quite understood\u00a0\u2013 as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.\" Mike Flanagan, director of the film adaptation of Doctor Sleep, would reconcile the differences between novel and film versions of The Shining there. Doctor Sleep is a direct adaptation of its novel counterpart, which itself is a sequel to the novel version of The Shining, but is also a continuation of Kubrick's film; in explaining the latter, Flanagan expressed, \"The Shining is so ubiquitous and has burned itself into the collective imagination of people who love cinema in a way that so few movies have. There\u2019s no other language to tell that story in. If you say \u2018Overlook Hotel,\u2019 I see something. It lives right up in my brain because of Stanley Kubrick. You can't pretend that isn't the case\". King initially rejected Flanagan's pitch of bringing back the Overlook as seen in Kubrick's film, but changed his mind after Flanagan pitched a scene within the hotel towards the end of the film that served as his reason to bring back the Overlook. Upon reading the script, King was so satisfied with the result that he said, \"Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version of The Shining is redeemed for me here.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813. Thomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s. The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County. What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed. With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal. Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_952", "question": "What genre is Kiss?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_38504", "text": "From the start of writing the Buffy series, Joss Whedon asserted that it would never have a \"very special episode\" as in contemporary series Beverly Hills, 90210, The Wonder Years, or Party of Five, where the core cast of characters addresses a single issue and resolve all the problems at the end. Whedon was not interested in finding a life-affirming lesson for \"The Body\". Rather, he wanted to capture the isolation and boredom involved in the minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died, what he termed \"the black ashes in your mouth numbness of death\". He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode. He tried to achieve an \"unlovely physicality\" in \"The Body\" to portray the upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible. Small details became significant: to protect her dignity, Buffy pulls the hem of Joyce's skirt down after it rode up when she attempted CPR; the camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while Buffy vomits; to emphasize Buffy's isolation, the scene has no exterior establishing shots of the house. The opening sequence of \"The Body\" was also the closing scene of the previous episode, \"I Was Made to Love You\"; this is the only episode in the series that was first aired without a \"Previously on Buffy\" lead-in. The Christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast the stark reality of the rest of the episode, and to avoid having the credits appear over the beginning scenes where Buffy is trying to revive her mother. The episode is presented in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar . Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move through the house and calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, \"We're not supposed to move the body!\" Both Gellar and Trachtenberg were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, \"you try to separate it as best you can and at the same time it adds that extra layer\". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar \"at a fever pitch\", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure. Kristine Sutherland was informed during the third season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended to spend time in Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of \"The Body\" was strange and tense because she had been a regular character through the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies. The most difficult scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession about what to wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene. Whedon's rejection of the \"very special episode\" format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within \"The Body\". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the \"lesbian kiss episode\" in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it the primary focus of the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was \"not negotiable\". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was \"true to character\" and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so. When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in \"The Body\", saying \"They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy.\" Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was \"truly groundbreaking\"; no long speech, no huge discovery: \"Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world\". Tropiano calls it \"A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do.\" Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers \"the heart of the experience\" and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the \"whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters\". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality of dealing with the crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After discovering that Laura has been tied up and raped, Chyna leaves, promising to return. Chyna hears Laura screaming and runs upstairs, intending to attack Vess with a knife. Before she can intervene, Vess kills Laura and takes her to his motor home. Unaware Laura is dead, Chyna sneaks aboard the motor home and finds her friend's corpse. Before she can escape, Vess drives away. Chyna hides in a back room, planning to escape at the earliest opportunity. When Vess stops at a gas station, she sneaks out of the motor home and looks for a payphone. Chyna secretly watches Vess boast to the gas station clerks that he is holding a young girl, Ariel, prisoner in his basement, before he kills them and drives away. She feels compelled to follow Vess and help free Ariel, taking a clerk's car. Chyna passes Vess while traveling through a state park and intentionally crashes her car into a redwood tree. While Vess gets out to investigate, Chyna sneaks on board the motor home. However, unbeknownst to Chyna, Vess glimpses her. Fascinated, he decides not to kill her immediately, wanting to see what she will do. Eventually, they arrive at Vess's remote house. Vess watches as Chyna leaves the motor home. She enters the house to find a catatonic Ariel locked in a room in the basement. Before she can free Ariel, Vess attacks Chyna in the kitchen, punching her unconscious before binding her with a chain. He taunts her for a while, revealing details about his past crimes. Obsessed with the \"intensity\" of any particular experience, sensory and existential, Vess styles himself as a \"homicidal adventurer\" and has killed continually since childhood. He offers to allow Chyna to live if she aids him in tormenting Ariel out of her catatonia. After Vess leaves for work, Chyna manages to break away from the table to which she is chained and slam her chair into a wall. She releases Ariel from her prison. Vess has trained a pack of deadly Dobermann pinschers to guard his property and kill anyone attempting to get in or out.

Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a \"champion\", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their \"Nexus\", a large structure located within. League of Legends received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively; the negative and abusive in-game behavior of its players, criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, the game regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an animated series, Arcane. Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games, including a mobile version, a digital collectible card game and a turn-based role-playing game, among others. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the property is in development. Regularly cited as the world's largest esport, the game has an international competitive scene consisting of 12 leagues. These domestic leagues culminate in the annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019 event registered over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million.

The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers in the style of a music video was a major influence on other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as Flashdance , Footloose and Dirty Dancing . It also inspired the creation of other similar performing arts schools around the world, including the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts , and the BRIT School. The film and its title song helped launch Irene Cara's musical career. She recorded three solo albums and contributed to several film soundtracks, notably performing \"Flashdance...What a Feeling\", the title song for Flashdance, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Paul McCrane, Meg Tilly, and Barry Miller went on to successful acting careers, while Gene Anthony Ray, Debbie Allen and Lee Curerri found success and popularity with the television series. Ray struggled with drug and alcohol addictions, and worked sporadically after the series ended in 1987. In 1996, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive and died after a stroke on November 14, 2003. The film was Christopher Gore's only original screenplay. He was also involved with the 1982 television series as its creator, and wrote several episodes before his death from AIDS on May 18, 1988.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds .  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format. The influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time. The traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings. While his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer. Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other.

Many reviewers directed their criticism at Diana Ross, who they believed was too old to play Dorothy. Most agreed that what had worked so successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen. Hischak's Through the Screen Door: What Happened to the Broadway Musical When It Went to Hollywood criticized \"Joel Schumacher's cockamamy screenplay\", and called \"Believe in Yourself\" the score's weakest song. He described Diana Ross's portrayal of Dorothy as: \"cold, neurotic and oddly unattractive\"; and noted that the film was \"a critical and box office bust\". In his work History of the American Cinema, Harpole characterized the film as \"one of the decade's biggest failures\", and, \"the year's biggest musical flop\". The Grove Book of Hollywood noted that \"the picture finished off Diana Ross's screen career\", as the film was Ross's final theatrical feature. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, Tom Shone referred to The Wiz as \"expensive crud\". In the book Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, the author criticized the script, noting, \"The Wiz was too scary for children, and too silly for adults.\" Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film, did not think highly of The Wiz, stating \"The Wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal that the classic MGM musical has obtained.\" Jackson's performance as the Scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed \"genuine acting talent\" and \"provided the only genuinely memorable moments.\" Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: \"I don't think it could have been any better, I really don't.\" In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was \"my greatest experience so far . . . I'll never forget that.\" Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film some of its most positive reviews on Sneak Previews. Siskel called it \"superior musical theater,\" said Diana Ross was \"superb,\" \"terrific\" and came across as \"a real star\" but had reservations about the film's \"heavy message.\" Ebert praised other cast members and numerous technical aspects of the film, saying it was \"fun\" and in the \"great tradition of the American musical.\" The film received another positive critique for its elaborate set design in the book American Jewish Filmmakers, which noted that it \"features some of the most imaginative adaptations of New York locales since the glory days of the Astaire-Rogers films.\" In a 2004 review of the film, Christopher Null wrote positively of Ted Ross and Richard Pryor's performances. However, Null's overall review of the film was critical, and he wrote that other than the song \"Ease on Down the Road\", \"the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing, garish sets, and a Joel Schumacher-scripted mess that runs 135 agonizing minutes.\" A 2005 piece by Hank Stuever in The Washington Post described the film as \"a rather appreciable delight, even when it's a mess\", and felt that the singing \u2013 especially Diana Ross's \u2013 was \"a marvel\". The New York Times analyzed the film within a discussion of the genre of blaxploitation: \"As the audience for blaxploitation dwindled, it seemed as if Car Wash and The Wiz might be the last gasp of what had been a steadily expanding black presence in mainstream filmmaking.\" The St. Petersburg Times noted, \"Of course, it only took one flop like The Wiz to give Hollywood an excuse to retreat to safer creative ground until John Singleton and Spike Lee came along. Yet, without blaxploitation there might not have been another generation of black filmmakers, no Denzel Washington or Angela Bassett, or they might have taken longer to emerge.\" The Boston Globe commented, \"the term 'black film' should be struck from the critical vocabulary.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

{"id": "91_992", "question": "What genre is Omen?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_23445", "text": "American scholar Brad Duren argued that The Omen was part of a trend of films featuring cosmic horror that started with Rosemary's Baby in 1968, but the film was unusual at the time because it concerned the \"end times\" predicted in The Book of Revelation and used the ideology of premillennial dispensationalism favored by American fundamentalist Protestants. Duren further maintained that the box office success of The Omen, which concerned the first stages of the Apocalypse as the Antichrist is born, reflected the zeitgeist of 1970s America. In 1973, an advertising executive and evangelical Christian, Robert Munger, who had read Hal Lindsey's book The Late, Great Planet Earth, speculated to film producer Harvey Bernard about the possibility that the Antichrist might be walking the earth in the form of a child, unknown to the vast majority of humanity. This conversation inspired Bernard with the idea for the film that became The Omen. Bernard commissioned script-writer David Seltzer to write a script for the film. Seltzer in turn borrowed many ideas from premillennial dispensationalism, especially The Late, Great Planet Earth, while inventing his own. For an example, a supposed quote from the Book of Revelation featured in The Omen is a fabrication created by Seltzer. Likewise, the sinister figure who will rule the world for seven years predicted in The Book of Revelation, commonly known as the Antichrist, is not described in the Bible as the son of Satan, whereas Seltzer made Satan the father of the Antichrist in The Omen. Duren commented that it was a sign of the popularity of The Omen that ever since the film was released in 1976 it is widely believed, even by evangelical Christians, that Satan will be the father of the Antichrist despite the fact that the Bible says nothing of the sort . In the same vein, the film's portrayal of certain Catholic priests as the allies of the Antichrist owes much to fundamentalist Protestant views of the Roman Catholic Church and has nothing to do with Catholic doctrine. The \"daggers of Megiddo\", which are the only things that can kill the Antichrist in The Omen, are not mentioned in the Book of Revelation, which states that only Christ can kill the Antichrist. Finally, Duren stated that the film massively distorts the Book of Revelation by requiring Robert Thorn to kill Damien with one of the sacred daggers as the only way to avert the Apocalypse. In fact, the Book of Revelation contends that the Apocalypse will be a horrific but necessary chapter in the future that will end in the ultimate triumph of good over evil and the salvation of humanity. Duren wrote that from a fundamentalist viewpoint Damien should not be killed because his temporary rule as the dictator of the world will be followed by the eternal rule of Christ, but Seltzer needed to add dramatic tension to the story. Duren noted that Munger, who served as the religious consultant on the film, should have been aware of the film's distortions of the Bible. The success of the film in 1976 may have been due to a sense of malaise in the West at the time. As film critic John Kenneth Muir wrote: \"What if the Bible is correct? What if all the signs of the Apocalypse are happening around about now? Would we believe them? Heck, would we even notice?\" Duren wrote that though it was unlikely that most people who viewed the film in 1976 accepted the dispensationalist viewpoint, the mere feeling that the world or the West was in terminal decline gave the film a resonance that its subsequent sequels lacked. Beyond the success of the film, Duren wrote that the impact of the film on popular culture can be seen in the way that many people accept the dispensationalist reading of the Book of Revelation as the correct interpretation whereas in fact, the dispensationalist interpretation was and still is rejected by many churches. Duren wrote that dispensationalism had once been a \"fringe\" theory within Protestant theology, but due to the popularity of The Omen it is now widely accepted as doctrine. Duren noted that in the film it has to be explained to Robert Thorn that the number 666 is the \"mark of the beast\" as presumably the audiences in 1976 were not familiar with this aspect of the Book of Revelation, but because of the film's popularity, the number 666 has entered popular culture and most people, even those of a secular bent, are aware of the sinister significance attached to the number.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds .  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format. The influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time. The traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings. While his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer. Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford.

Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do.

Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other.

Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship.

I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence. But at the same time, how else are we going to make a film that faithfully mirrors the truth out there in our society? This is a story about misfits in a world of misfits.

Jones, came to the attention of Universal Pictures through executive Jeff Kirschenbaum, a comic book fan who sought a film adaptation that would be considered a \"hard-R\" and encouraged the studio to pick up the rights to the miniseries. By 2004, producer Marc Platt had gotten the film rights, and lobbied the studio to get Russian-Kazakh director Timur Bekmambetov, as Platt considered that the visual style and sensibility Bekmambetov showed in Night Watch and its sequel Day Watch fit Wanted in the sense that \"the comic is dark and edgy but it also has an ironic, comedic tone beneath its violent action.\" In December 2005, Bekmambetov was hired to direct, his first English-language film, and writers Derek Haas and Michael Brandt were assigned the script. Bekmambetov described the original comic as \"risky and very provocative\", with \"a twist and good characters\", and declared that the thing that attracted him the most in Wanted was how it went through various film genres in its plot: \"It's a comedy, a tragedy, a drama, a melodrama. Every scene, we change genres and that's why our movie is different.\" Universal was initially reluctant on giving a potentially lucrative action film to a filmmaker who had never made an English-language film, but Platt convinced the studio that he could \"create an environment that would allow Timur to be himself as a filmmaker and exercise his creative muscles.\" Millar was unhappy with the first draft of the screenplay, considering the approach to be \"too tame\" and \"a little bit Americanized\" given he wanted \"basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want, then choosing the dark path.\" The author only started to support the direction the project was taking once Bekmambetov \"came in with his Eastern European madness\" and the intention of coming closer to the spirit of the book. Bekmambetov said that he would take liberty in adapting the comic book's world: \"It's difficult for me to just follow. It's interesting for me to create. I feel a little bit different how this world has to be executed.\" In July 2006, screenwriter Chris Morgan was hired to revise the third act of Haas and Brandt's script. Haas and Brandt returned to refine the character of Wesley Gibson, which they had established in their first draft. Millar saw previsualized footage of the film and said that it exceeded his expectations for the adaptation. He described its first half as being close to the source comic, and added the ending was similar though it was relocated elsewhere from the comic's original setting. The superhero costumes in the series were also removed, with the exception of the leather attire worn by Wesley and Fox. Incidentally, this had been Millar's intent when writing the miniseries, but he and artist J. G. Jones had forgotten to. Millar said, \"I wanted them to have those powers and then just wear those costumes for the initiation, but just for one panel. And then I forgot.\" Millar also stated that he would have liked to keep the supervillain mythos that dictates the original comic in the film. Millar was favorable to most of the changes in the storyline, which includes the story arc of the Fates issuing death orders in line with the series' original theme of predestination.", "hasanswer": false}]}

How to be Both shows us that the arrangement of a story, even when it's the same story, can change our understanding of it and define our emotional attachments. We may have known this, but to see it enacted with such imagination is dazzling indeed.

The possibilities unleashed by the desire to be neither one thing nor the other means that one may ever and always strive to be both.

Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\".

The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria. The relative isolation of the Lebanese mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the Levant. As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and existence of several well established sects and religions, notably, Maronites, Druze, Shiite Muslims, Ismailis, Alawites and Jacobites. During the 11th century the Druze religion emerged from a branch of Shia Islam. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The southern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families to the early 14th century. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. Keserwan, Jabal Amel and the Beqaa Valley was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, Sidon, Tyre, Acre, Tripoli, Beirut, and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture. Following the fall of Roman Anatolia to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the Crusades launched by the Franks from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially Syria and Palestine . The First Crusade succeeded in temporarily establishing the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast. These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks. Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the Eastern Mediterranean, who swore allegiance to Constantinople or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family.

{"id": "91_1020", "question": "What genre is The Visitors?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24563", "text": "As the \"first true megamusical\", Cats pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals\u00a0\u2014 including Les Mis\u00e9rables , The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon \u2014 that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained: Cats introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting\u00a0\u2014 and then aggressively promoting\u00a0\u2014 a single recognisable image as the face of the show. The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline to create what The Daily Telegraph called \"one of musical theatre's greatest posters\". Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for Les Mis\u00e9rables and the Phantom's mask for The Phantom of the Opera. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called \"critic-proof\" status of megamusicals. Additionally, Cats was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official Cats t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry. Beyond the megamusical, Cats also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: \"Cats is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped. People do want a theatrical experience for their children.\" Thanks to its easily accessible spectacle, the original Broadway production also tapped into the then-burgeoning tourist boom in New York and its audience shifted increasingly towards foreign visitors in its later years. Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to Cats, citing the latter's disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience. The musical's fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey's pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an \"architectural manner\", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of Cats was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre. Cats opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote: In the 1980s, the success of local productions of Cats in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit. The musical was also a boon for the Broadway touring industry. In 1997, The New York Times credited the regional and touring productions of Cats with \"almost single-handedly reviv[ing] the sagging road business\". Cats revolutionised the touring business by introducing the now commonplace practice of extended touring engagements that can last several weeks or months in a single city, as opposed to the typical one-week or ten-day tour stop. Mackintosh's insistence that all touring productions of Cats replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical's demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_1021", "question": "What genre is The New Spirit?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_3638", "text": "During his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting\u2014rhetorically\u2014that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\". A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\". Poe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work in Continental Europe. Poe's early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H.\u00a0G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell. Horror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft stated, \"When I write stories, Edgar Allan Poe is my model.\" Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films\". Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators. One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook. Even so, Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\", and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\". Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"\u2014the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger. It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film's female leads were played by Cathy Moriarty, who had made her film debut in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull , and Kathryn Walker, who had been the girlfriend of Belushi's National Lampoon colleague Douglas Kenney . The production of Neighbors was troubled. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd switched their roles in pre-production, acting against type . Belushi and Aykroyd also argued constantly with director John G.

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\" Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

An art dealer recognized his talent and saw to it that Jacob was able to work in the studio of Hubertus van Hove.  There he painted interiors as well as figurative and genre works. Van Hove took Maris under his wings and was not only his boss but also his new teacher. Van Hove moved to Antwerp and the nineteen-year-old Maris went with him. This relationship continued until his brother Matthijs received a royal subsidy and joined Jacob.  Together they rented space which also had room for their friend Lawrence Alma-Tadema. They took lessons at the Antwerp Academy and were able to sell some of their works. After this he traveled through Germany, Switzerland and France in 1861. Like many of the Hague School alumni, Jacob Maris had enormous success in the Netherlands and abroad. He sold the biggest part of his paintings to private collectors in the United States and in Scotland. In 1857, Jacob Maris returned to the Hague, but Matthijs stayed another year in Antwerp before he again shared a studio with Jacob in The Hague. After they had earned enough money by copying eight royal portraits, they were able to go to Oosterbeek where they met Johannes Warnardus Bilders, his son Gerard, and others who later play important parts in the Hague School. The brothers also went on a study trip together  to Germany, Switzerland and France. When their money was spent, they again moved in with their parents and Jacob took more lessons at the Hague Academy of Art. In the summer of 1864, Jacob again went to Oosterbeek and possibly to Fontainebleau and Barbizon. Following this trip he lived in  Paris from 1865 till 1871, and then returned to the Netherlands when the Franco-Prussian War broke out. In The Hague, he became a strong landscape painter painting rivers and landscapes with mills and towpaths, and beach views with fishing boats.   His stroke became broader and larger and his use of color became more subdued and directed towards portraying the atmospheric depiction of clouds. This part of has been compared to the seventeenth-century painters Jan van Goyen, Jacob Van Ruisdael and Johannes Vermeer. His way of working has been described in the following way:  Also, M. Philippe Zilcken said, In 1871, Maris became a member of the Pulchri Studio and would fill various administrative positions there. It was only after 1876 that he experienced any renown  in the Netherlands and from 1885 on he was a celebrated painter. As a leader of the Hague School his influence was enormous. Nevertheless, Willem de Zwart and possibly Bernard Blommers had been his only students. When he was in his sixties, Maris began to suffer from asthma and corpulence. At the advice of his doctors he went to take the waters at Karlsbad, where he suddenly died on 7 August 1899.  He was buried in The Hague.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jacob suggests several explanations: first, the name connection ; second, the double-sided nature, the \"other side of the stereotypical sunshine city, Beach Boys and Walt Disney\", \"the place of pain, anonymity, alienation and broken dreams\".; third, American noir was originally a \"Los Angelian genre\".  Angel was originally conceived as supernatural noir. Noir had continued investigation of the \"dark city, a place of regression and darkness as a counterpoint to the city's promise of progress and civilization\" that had begun under William Blake and Charles Dickens.

Production designer Stuart Blatt outlined the new base: \"An old hotel, something [the writers] could use to evoke the past of Los Angeles and some of Angel's history, something kind of creepy and spooky but not too dark because they didn't want something depressing, it's called the Hyperion Hotel.

Developed by Shiny Entertainment, the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001. Unlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana\u2014energy for casting spells\u2014constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks. Sacrifice was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tesselation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as Tim Curry, and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei. Sacrifice was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw.

The creature was designed by Chin Wei-chen, the modeling was done by New Zealand-based Weta Workshop and the animatronics were by John Cox's creature Workshop. The CGI for the film was done by The Orphanage, which also did some of the visual effects in The Day After Tomorrow. The monster was designed with some specific parameters in mind. According to the director himself the inspiration came from a local article about a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the Han River. Therefore, the director's wishes were for it to look like an actual mutated fish-like creature, rather than have a more fantastical design. In the opening scenes of the film, two fishermen presumably encounter the creature whilst it is still small enough to fit in one of their cups; suggestive of its humble, more realistic origins. The monster also exhibits frontal limbs similar to amphibians' legs. This element of its design seems to have been more a choice of functionality on the designers' part as the monster needed to be able to run and perform certain acrobatic movements during the film. For a genre film monster, the creature's size is rather small, only about the size of a truck. Also unlike in many other monster-themed films, the creature is fully visible from early on in the film, sometimes for large stretches of time and even in broad daylight, which earned the film some critical praise.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco. The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587, when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay.

Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century.

Dealers deliver!  Hiding us away in a three-hundred room former convent was a prescription for total lunacy.\"  Largely due to their drug consumption, both Tyler and Perry were not as involved in the writing and recording as they had been on previous albums. According to Perry: Producer Jack Douglas, who had started producing the band with Get Your Wings in 1974, expressed similar feelings about the apathy that permeated the recording sessions: For his part, Tyler has maintained that it was the band's lethargy, not his, that slowed his progress, because \"I wasn't Patti Smith writing poetry. I write exactly to the music, and when the music ain't coming, neither were the lyrics.\"  However, Tyler confessed to Alan di Perna of Guitar World in April 1997, \"What I specifically remember was not being present in the studio because I was so stoned.  In the past, I always had to be there and hear every note that was going downwho was playing what and were they out of tune... I just didn't care anymore.\"  Tyler's condition is evident in some of his lyrics, such as the line \"pass me the vial and cross your fingers that it don't take time.\"  In the VH1 Behind the Music episode on the group Douglas states, \"People were shooting, bullets were flying.  It was insane.  People, drugs and guns. You know, they don't go together,\" with drummer Joey Kramer adding, \"I don't know if we did any of those sessions, or made any of that record, straight.\"  In his autobiography Rocks, Perry admits that he had misplaced a cookie tin full of demos for the band that he had prepared in his basement studio, irritating Douglas, but they were eventually found by Perry's wife Elyssa: Relations deteriorated further when Perry presented \"Bright Light Fright\" to the band and they \"didn't like it. I said, 'Do you want to do it or not?' They said no.\" Perry, who has stated the song was inspired by the Sex Pistols, sang the song himself on the LP. Of \"Draw the Line,\" Tyler later recalled, \"Joe had this lick on a six-string bass that was so definitive, the song just about wrote itself. It reached down my neck and grabbed the lyrics out of my throat.\" The song encompasses many of the typical things Aerosmith is known for, including the strong rhythm backbeat and the back-and-forth interplay between guitarists Perry and Brad Whitford. The song slows down before building to a climax showcasing Tyler's trademark scream. The B-side of some versions of \"Draw the Line,\" \"Chip Away the Stone\", was not on the LP but eventually surfaced on the compilation album Gems. It was written by Richard Supa, received a fair amount of radio airplay after the release of Gems and found its way into Aerosmith's live set-lists for a while. Kramer explained in 1997 that \"Kings and Queens,\" the LP's second single, was a \"typical session at the Cenacle. It was recorded in the chapel with the pews out, the drums on the altar. Jack was in the confessional, hitting the snare drum by himself.\" In his memoir, Tyler writes that the song's lyrics were inspired by a \"medieval fantasy\" that featured \"a stoned-out rock star in his tattered satin rags lying on the ancient stone floor of a castle - slightly mad, but still capable of conjuring up a revolutionary album that would astound the ears of the ones who heard it and make the critics cringe.\" Jack Douglas plays the mandolin on the track, which was also used as a B-side to Aerosmith's version of the Beatles' \"Come Together,\" released to promote the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band film and soundtrack. \"Get It Up\" features Karen Lawrence, singer of the band L.A. Jets, on the chorus. David Krebs later stated that he felt Tyler's lyrics on songs like \"Get It Up\" did not help the album's standing among Aerosmith fans: \"The essence of Aerosmith had always been a positive and very macho sexuality, total unashamed, a little sleazy... They didn't want to hear lyrics like 'Get It Up,' which repeated over and over again, Can't get it up'... The negative lyrics were a big problem.\" \"Get It Up\" was released as the album's third single but failed to break into the singles chart. The song is noted for its usage of slide guitar and was played occasionally by the band during the Aerosmith Express Tour from 1977 to 1978 in support of the Draw the Line album. The band did not have enough original material to cover the running time for a single album so they recorded two blues classics: Otis Rush's \"All Your Love\" and Kokomo Arnold's \"Milk Cow Blues.\" Reception Contemporary reviews were quite negative. Billy Altman of  Rolling Stone called the LP \"a truly horrendous record, chaotic to the point of malfunction and with an almost impenetrably dense sound adding to the confusion.\" Robert Christgau considered the album the product of a band \"out of gas\". Retrospective reviews are more positive. Kerrang! magazine listed the album at No. 37 among the \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\" for its \"high energy\", although it never touches heavy metal as a genre, concluding with the comment \"sleaze was never so classy.\" According to Greg Prato of AllMusic, \"the band shies away from studio experimenting and dabbling in different styles,\" returning \"to simple, straight-ahead hard rock\" and releasing \"the last true studio album from Aerosmith's original lineup for nearly a decade.\" Another AllMusic reviewer stated that, \"although some fans see Draw the Line as the beginning of a decline for Aerosmith, it still offers up some strong hard-rock tunes. One of its best moments is the title track, one of the group's most relentless rockers.\" In a review for Ultimate Classic Rock, Sterling Whitaker cited \"Get It Up\" as an example of a track that \"should-have-been-great-but-not-quite,\" saying that it \"featured important elements of the classic Aerosmith sound, but somehow didn't catch fire.\" Martin Popoff defined Draw the Line \"complicated, murky and layered\", coming across as \"the serious, distressed Aerosmith album\". He also wrote that despite \"being ambiguously dense, uncommunicative and busy\", the album showed the band reaching \"new levels of musical maturity.\" Draw the Line went platinum its first month of release, entering the music charts on December 24, 1977, peaking at No. 11 on the US Billboard 200, and eventually being certified 2x multi-platinum nearly a decade later. Even so, it marks the band's first slowdown in album sales of their 1970s era, after their initial rise with the albums Toys in the Attic and Rocks.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_1038", "question": "What genre is Madman at War?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_44875", "text": "In 1980, Harvey Weinstein was desperate to break into the movie business. Weinstein and producing partner Michael Cohl recognized the success of low-budget horror films such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween , and began swapping horror stories. Having heard stories about the Cropsy legend when he was a young camper in upstate New York, Weinstein brought the idea to Cohl, who loved it. The project was initiated before the popularity of Sean S. Cunningham's sleeper hit Friday the 13th , with Harvey Weinstein creating a five-page treatment in 1979 under the title \"The Cropsy Maniac\" and registering it in April 1980, a full month before Cunningham's film was released. Coincidentally, at the same time, director Joseph Ellison also had a film in pre-production under the title \"The Burning\", but changed the name to Don't Go in the House to avoid confusion with Weinstein's film. The production also bore similarities to another slasher movie in pre-production, a film that would become known as Madman . In summer 1980, during a casting call for Madman, one of the actresses commented that her boyfriend was acting in The Burning. This prompted Madman to change its entire premise, which was built around the Cropsy legend. This change caused story alterations on Madman, and filming on that film was delayed until October 1980. Madmans delay was costly for the film, as it did not receive a theatrical release until January 1982. The over-saturation of genre films competing with each other was one of the side-effects of the early 1980s slasher boom. Cohl told Variety that he, Weinstein and producer Corky Burger took an early version of the script to the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, where it was met with positive reception, although they rejected initial six-figure offers, hoping to land more money once the film had been shot. This was a similar approach to how Friday the 13th had earned distribution with Paramount Pictures. British director Tony Maylam, known for rock music documentaries in the 1970s, was hired as The Burnings director in summer 1980. Maylam had met Weinstein and Burger while the producers worked as rock promoters. During his discussion with film critic Alan Jones on the commentary track of MGM's DVD, Maylam said that once he came on board things moved very quickly. The screenplay was written in just six weeks and was sculpted to conform to the emerging genre conventions of the time. As it was, the film takes place mostly outside and is set in summer, so there was only a small window of opportunity to make the film or, perhaps, have to wait until the following year. Knowing that the slasher craze would not last forever, and wanting to get their film released before it fizzled out, the producers rushed into production. The screenplay was written by Peter Lawrence and Harvey's brother, Bob Weinstein. Again, showing a knowledge of the then in-vogue conventions of the slasher movie, the script showcased a murder every ten minutes in the script. It was Maylam's idea to make Cropsy's weapon-of-choice gardening shears. The film originally had a different ending. A script dated July 6, 1980 shifted the location to one much more in keeping with a summer camp slasher. Originally, the showdown was to take place in a boathouse. The other big change is that Todd ends up as the \"final boy\" rather than as the heroic adult, and Alfred is killed by Cropsy. Other changes included an excised character named Alan, who was to be the love interest for Tiger. This version also ends with a campfire scene, but the last line is different: \"...And every year he seeks revenge for the terrible things those kids did to him ... every year he kills!\" The production company became Miramax, named after Harvey and Bob Weinstein's parents, Miriam and Max, who helped fund the picture. The budget is reported to have been between $500,000 and $1.5 million, although the latter is more often cited. Cohl admitted that the fact that most of the people behind the production were relatively new to the movie business did cause some problems, and the film did go over budget \u2014 with them underestimating how much money would have to be spent on behind-the-scenes elements.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eurogamer cited that \"the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the Half-Life story is absolute genius\", while GameSpy noted, \"What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration.\" The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the standalone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28\u00a0reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version. The game generated a fan following for the Weighted Companion Cube\u2014even though the cube itself does not talk or act in the game. Fans have created plush and papercraft versions of the cube and the various turrets, as well as PC case mods and models of the Portal cake and portal gun. Jeep Barnett, a programmer for Portal, noted that players have told Valve that they had found it more emotional to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube than to harm one of the \"Little Sisters\" from BioShock. Both GLaDOS and the Weighted Companion Cube were nominated for the Best New Character Award on G4, with GLaDOS winning the award for \"having lines that will be quoted by gamers for years to come.\" Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation praised the game as \"absolutely sublime from start to finish ... I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game\". He felt the short length was ideal as it did not outstay its welcome. Writing for GameSetWatch in 2009, columnist Daniel Johnson pointed out similarities between Portal and Erving Goffman's essay on dramaturgy, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, which equates one's persona to the front and backstage areas of a theater. The game was also made part of the required course material among other classical and contemporary works, including Goffman's work, for a freshman course \"devoted to engaging students with fundamental questions of humanity from multiple perspectives and fostering a sense of community\" for Wabash College in 2010. Portal has also been cited as a strong example of instructional scaffolding that can be adapted for more academic learning situations, as the player, through careful design of levels by Valve, is first hand-held in solving simple puzzles with many hints at the correct solution, but this support is slowly removed as the player progresses in the game, and completely removed when the player reaches the second half of the game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Hamish Todd considered Portal as an exemplary means of game design by demonstrating a series of chambers after the player has obtained the portal gun that gently introduce the concept of flinging without any explicit instructions. Portal was exhibited at the Smithsonian Art Exhibition in America from February 14 through September 30, 2012. Portal won the \"Action\" section for the platform \"Modern Windows\". Since its release Portal is still considered one of the  best video games of all time, having been included on several cumulative \"Top Games of All Time\" lists through 2018.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it \"defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never been anything like this before.\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as \"like eating popcorn, but it's not just any old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel...[Woo's] ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie\". Later critiques of the film remained positive. The Washington Post stated that \"the plot doesn't exactly break new crime-story ground. It's all the Woo flourishes...that elevates The Killer to another level\". Lucia Bozzola of the online film database Allmovie gave the film a five star rating, and stated it as \"One of the high points of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema\". Empire gave the film five stars and proclaimed that \"John Woo's trademark style reached its zenith in The Killer\".

Legacy The Killer has been recognized as an important and influential film for both Western and Asian filmmakers. Film scholars have noted the similarities between Woo's style and The Killer with the films Nikita and L\u00e9on directed by French director Luc Besson.Mazdon, 2000. p.108 Kenneth E. Hall described L\u00e9on as having the similar character configuration of a hitman and the person he protects. In Nikita, the main character's crisis of conscience after performing a number of hits is also seen in The Killer. Lucy Mazdon described the style of Nikita as recalling \"the work of directors like John Woo. Like Nikita, Woo's films show alienated and often brutal characters and graphic violence\". Brandon Lee used The Killer as an influence when choreographing his fight scenes in the film Rapid Fire. In the United States, directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino developed films that were influenced by The Killer.Elder, 2005. p.143 Rodriguez's films El Mariachi , Desperado , & Once Upon A Time In Mexico contain stylistic homages to The Killer. In the film Jackie Brown, Tarantino wrote dialog referencing The Killer. No references to the film are made in the original novel. Asian-based directors were also influenced by the film. Hong Kong director Johnnie To borrows from The Killer's gunfighting style, oppositional character pairing, and parody in his films A Hero Never Dies, Running Out of Time, and Fulltime Killer.Hall, 2009. p.63The Killer was also influential on hip hop music. American hip hop artist, and Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically praised debut album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... that sampled numerous portions of dialog from the film. RZA, the producer of the album described the album's themes by stating that \"Rae and Ghost was two opposite guys as far as neighborhoods was concerned, I used John Woo's The Killer. [In that movie] you got Chow Yun Fat [playing the role of Ah Jong] and Danny Lee [Inspector Li]. They have to become partners to work shit out.\" Woo felt honored that the group sampled The Killer and asked for no monetary return from them. In 2005, Vibe magazine placed The Killer at number 21 on their list of top fifty films that shaped hip hop.

In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". \"Mothership\" essentially means \"Main series\", where as \"Escort\" essentially means \"Spinoff\". One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

Genesis and Yes were directly influenced by the band's initial style of symphonic Mellotron rock, and many King Crimson band members were involved in other notable bands: Lake in Emerson, Lake & Palmer ; McDonald in Foreigner; Burrell in Bad Company, and Wetton in U.K. and Asia. Canadian rock band Rush's drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles on his own approach to percussion. King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practised together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century \" and the name of their record label, Epitaph , comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences. King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula's Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti. Members of metal bands Mudvayne, Voivod, Enslaved, Yob, Pyrrhon, and Pallbearer have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Zeni Geva, Ancestors, and Oranssi Pazuzu all cite King Crimson's influence. Other artists affected by King Crimson include video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow, jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land, folktronica exponent Juana Molina, hip hop producer RJD2, hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge, film director Hal Hartley, and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Muga: Muga is the high priest of the Temple. Due to his body being host to the horrific 'soul bugs', he has been transformed into a giant and bizarre monster. Muga surprises Kotaro in the Temple, having knocked Kurenai unconscious, saying she will make a fine gift to Lord Tohjo. When asked what Lord Tohjo has to do with anything, Muga tells Kotaro that it does not matter because he will die soon anyway. Before their battle begins, Muga cracks his knuckles, saying that he has been praying to test his new powers. He is the second boss in Kotaro's path. Yukinosuke: Yukinosuke is Kotaro's childhood friend. Along with Kotaro he trained under his 'master' in kenjutsu, and could not best Kotaro, although Kotaro could not beat him either. He secretly harbours a deep feeling of resentment towards this fact, and strives for a way to defeat Kotaro . Some time after Kotaro left, he turned to Lord Tohjo and he gave him a soul bug, giving him more power. Despite this, the soul bug has not deformed him like other hosts, and he despises the soul bug.

Many reviewers directed their criticism at Diana Ross, who they believed was too old to play Dorothy. Most agreed that what had worked so successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen. Hischak's Through the Screen Door: What Happened to the Broadway Musical When It Went to Hollywood criticized \"Joel Schumacher's cockamamy screenplay\", and called \"Believe in Yourself\" the score's weakest song. He described Diana Ross's portrayal of Dorothy as: \"cold, neurotic and oddly unattractive\"; and noted that the film was \"a critical and box office bust\". In his work History of the American Cinema, Harpole characterized the film as \"one of the decade's biggest failures\", and, \"the year's biggest musical flop\". The Grove Book of Hollywood noted that \"the picture finished off Diana Ross's screen career\", as the film was Ross's final theatrical feature. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, Tom Shone referred to The Wiz as \"expensive crud\". In the book Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, the author criticized the script, noting, \"The Wiz was too scary for children, and too silly for adults.\" Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film, did not think highly of The Wiz, stating \"The Wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal that the classic MGM musical has obtained.\" Jackson's performance as the Scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed \"genuine acting talent\" and \"provided the only genuinely memorable moments.\" Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: \"I don't think it could have been any better, I really don't.\" In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was \"my greatest experience so far . . . I'll never forget that.\" Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film some of its most positive reviews on Sneak Previews. Siskel called it \"superior musical theater,\" said Diana Ross was \"superb,\" \"terrific\" and came across as \"a real star\" but had reservations about the film's \"heavy message.\" Ebert praised other cast members and numerous technical aspects of the film, saying it was \"fun\" and in the \"great tradition of the American musical.\" The film received another positive critique for its elaborate set design in the book American Jewish Filmmakers, which noted that it \"features some of the most imaginative adaptations of New York locales since the glory days of the Astaire-Rogers films.\" In a 2004 review of the film, Christopher Null wrote positively of Ted Ross and Richard Pryor's performances. However, Null's overall review of the film was critical, and he wrote that other than the song \"Ease on Down the Road\", \"the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing, garish sets, and a Joel Schumacher-scripted mess that runs 135 agonizing minutes.\" A 2005 piece by Hank Stuever in The Washington Post described the film as \"a rather appreciable delight, even when it's a mess\", and felt that the singing \u2013 especially Diana Ross's \u2013 was \"a marvel\". The New York Times analyzed the film within a discussion of the genre of blaxploitation: \"As the audience for blaxploitation dwindled, it seemed as if Car Wash and The Wiz might be the last gasp of what had been a steadily expanding black presence in mainstream filmmaking.\" The St. Petersburg Times noted, \"Of course, it only took one flop like The Wiz to give Hollywood an excuse to retreat to safer creative ground until John Singleton and Spike Lee came along. Yet, without blaxploitation there might not have been another generation of black filmmakers, no Denzel Washington or Angela Bassett, or they might have taken longer to emerge.\" The Boston Globe commented, \"the term 'black film' should be struck from the critical vocabulary. To appreciate just how outmoded, deceptive and limiting it is, consider the following, all of which have been described as black films, . . .\" and characterized The Wiz in a list that also featured 1970s films Shaft , Blacula , and Super Fly .

Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\". Furthermore, he added, \"Black is about the love between a girl and her teacher. They teach each other the dignity of living. To call Black a love story is a true compliment. Black is a pure love story.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly: NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two\u00a0hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the series's cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2\u00a0million for 30\u00a0seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the Seinfeld finale at $1.7\u00a0million. In the U.S., 52.5\u00a0million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998. Although not the most-watched episode of the series, the finale was the fourth\u00a0most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of M*A*S*H, Cheers and Seinfeld, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4 and 76.2\u00a0million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36\u00a0million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl.

The Red Army dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and Lower Silesia, with its coal mines and Szczecin, an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The socialist centrally planned economy of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the COMECON trade bloc. In 1985, collective enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 . In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent. This made the East German economy the richest in all of the Soviet Bloc until reunification in 1990. Notable East German exports were photographic cameras, under the Praktica brand; automobiles under the Trabant, Wartburg, and the IFA brands; hunting rifles, sextants, typewriters and wristwatches. Until the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of basic foodstuffs such as sugar and coffee. East Germans with friends or relatives in the West and the necessary Staatsbank foreign currency account could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via Intershop. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish Jauerfood, and Genex companies. The government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\". At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark . Economic issues would also persist in the east of Germany after the reunification of the west and the east.

Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14. A scientific study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result violence and war.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In contrast to the \"sexy\" or \"cute\" female stereotypes, the group is said to have rewritten history and brought about the expansion of girl group styles in the industry. Rolling Stone called them \"undeniably one of the most influential acts\" of their era, widening K-pop's musical scope and stated that in the process, they \"exerted a huge influence on the generation of artists\" that came after them. Tamar Herman wrote for Billboard, \"The group's aggressive, fashion-forward persona combined with their relatable lyrics enabled the quartet to rise to the top of the K-pop world\". The magazine ranked 2NE1 among the top K-pop girl groups of the decade; the \"quartet dominated K-pop with their fierce charisma from day one\", and \"2NE1's hard-hitting hip-pop styling launched a career that brought the act to astronomical heights, and paved the way for a more empowered side to K-pop girl groups.\" Fuse highlighted their addictive music and forward-thinking fashion and said they \"led the way for Korean pop and hip hop's international advancement.\" South China Morning Post called them one of the most iconic girl groups of their time, where they \"proved their artistry through their edgy visuals, out-of-the-box concepts, and their versatile sound, and have become one of the most influential powerhouses of K-pop.\" Atwood Magazine editor Kevin Young called the group one of K-pop's most internationally-renowned legacy acts: \"Their innovative signature sound of hip-hop based beats mixed in with rock, pop, R&B, and even reggae propelled them to the forefront.\" The group's work has been recognized globally, with Caitlin Kelley of Billboard calling \"I Am the Best\" \"one of the most iconic girl crush concepts on many levels\". Spin magazine ranked \"I Am the Best\" and \"Ugly\" the third- and ninth-best K-pop songs of all time, respectively. Both songs were included on Stereogum list of 20 best K-pop music videos, and editor Tom Breihan called \"I Am the Best\" video the \"greatest music video ever made\". Pitchfork listed \"Missing You\" as one of 20 essential K-pop songs, describing it as \"one of the most vocally rich and structurally distinctive singles Korea's ever produced\". Billboard ranked \"I Am the Best\" and \"I Love You\" the fourth- and 67th-greatest K-pop songs of the 2010s, noting 2NE1's versatility and their ability to \"transcen[d] linguistic barriers\".  \"Fire\" and \"I Am the Best\" were considered by music-industry experts some of the genre's defining girl-group songs in Melon and Seoul Shinmuns list of top 100 K-pop masterpieces of all time, \"set[ting] fire\" to a \"completely new attitude\" to the music of K-pop girl groups. British GQ called 2NE1 one of the industry's game-changers during the 2010s; the group \"not only brought K-pop to the curious attention of the Western fashion and music media\", but \"became a visual blueprint for the genre's feisty 'girl crush' concept.\" They have been called the \"Queens of K-pop\" by several media outlets for their contributions to the global spread of the Korean wave. Following the quartet's disbandment in late 2016, the editor-in-chief of webzine Idology wrote that the group established a new image of Korean female idols and went the farthest, creating a K-pop fandom abroad. Music critic Kim Yun-ha wrote that \"the expression 'reminiscent of 2NE1' will remain as an eternal praise of K-pop revolutionaries\". 2NE1 and their work has influenced or inspired numerous artists including I-dle, Blackpink, Lorde, Jeremy Scott, Mamamoo, Diplo, Chungha, Ailee, Jeon So-mi, Choi Ye-na, Oh My Girl's Seunghee, Woo!ah!, Choi Yoo-jung, Secret Number, Chocolat, Dal Shabet, Momoland's Jane, Loona's Vivi, Itzy's Lia, Hot Issue's Hyeongshin, and Swizz Beatz.

Roger Ebert reiterated Gene Siskel's earlier opinion, stating that the film was \"basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship.\" He described it as one of several science fiction pictures that were \"real disappointments\" compared to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, in both episodes Ebert singled out the early scene of the Nostromo crew exploring the alien planet for praise,  calling the scene \"inspired,\" said that it showed \"real imagination\" and claimed that it transcended the rest of the film. Over two decades later, Ebert had revised his opinion of the film, including it on his Great Movies list, where he gave it four stars and said \"Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original.\" In 1980, the film was included in Cinefantastiques list of the top films of the 1970s while failing to make the magazine's top ten. Frederick S. Clarke, the magazine's editor, wrote that Alien was \"an exercise in style, refreshingly adult in approach, wickedly grim and perverse, that manages to compensate for a lack of depth in both story and characters.\" In 1982, John Simon of the National Review praised the cast of Alien, particularly Sigourney Weaver, and the film's visual values. Simon also wrote, \"For fanciers of horror, among whose numbers I do not count myself, Alien is recommendable, provided they are free from hypocrisy and finicky stomachs\". Despite initial mixed reviews, Alien has received critical acclaim over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment, and is cited one of the best films of 1979. It is seen as one of the most influential science-fiction films. It holds a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 125 reviews and an average rating of 9.11/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A modern classic, Alien blends science fiction, horror and bleak poetry into a seamless whole.\" Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Halliwell's Film Guide awarded it a full four stars, describing it as \"a classic of suspense and art direction\". Alan Jones of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five, describing it as a \"revolutionary 'haunted house in space' thrill-ride [...] stunning you with shock after shock\", praising the \"top-notch acting [...] and imaginative bio-mechanical production design\", as well as \"Ridley Scott's eye for detail and brilliant way of alternating false scares with genuine jolts, which help to create a seamless blend of gothic horror and harrowing science fiction\". Critical interest in the film was re-ignited with the theatrical release of the \"Director's Cut\" in 2003. Roger Ebert ranked it among \"the most influential of modern action pictures\" and praised its pacing, atmosphere, and settings: David McIntee praises Alien as \"possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings.\" He notes that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: \"It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal.\" Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th , he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: \"The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.\" He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: \"Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim.\" David Edelstein wrote, \"Alien remains the key text in the 'body horror' subgenre that flowered in the seventies, and Giger's designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety. Men traveled through vulva-like openings, got forcibly impregnated, and died giving birth to rampaging gooey vaginas dentate \u2014 how's that for future shock? This was truly what David Cronenberg would call 'the new flesh,' a dissolution of the boundaries between man and machine, machine and alien, and man and alien, with a psychosexual invasiveness that has never, thank God, been equaled.\" In 2008, the American Film Institute ranked Alien as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre as part of AFI's 10 Top 10, a CBS television special ranking the ten greatest movies in ten classic American film genres. The ranks were based on a poll of over 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians, with Alien ranking just above Terminator 2: Judgment Day and just below Scott's other science fiction film Blade Runner . The same year, Empire magazine ranked it thirty-third on its list of the five hundred greatest movies of all time, based on a poll of 10,200 readers, critics, and members of the film industry. In 2021, Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number two in the \"25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made\".

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona , but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\" Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

Anna travels to Warsaw to visit her aunt Wanda, a chain-smoking, hard-drinking, sexually promiscuous judge who reveals that Anna's actual name is Ida Lebenstein; Ida's parents had been Jews who were murdered late in the German occupation of Poland during World War II . Ida, after being orphaned, was raised by nuns in a convent. Wanda, who had been a Communist resistance fighter against the German occupation, became the state prosecutor \"Red Wanda\"  who sent \"men to their deaths\". Wanda tells Ida that she should try worldly sins and pleasures before taking her vows. On their way to their hotel for the night, Wanda picks up a hitchhiker, Lis , who turns out to be an alto saxophone player who is going to a gig in the same town. Wanda tries to get Ida interested in Lis and come to his show, but she resists until going down after hours to watch the band wrap up their evening with a song after the crowd has left. Lis is drawn to Ida and talks with her before leaving for the night to rejoin her aunt, who is passed out in their room. Ida wants to see her parents' graves, R\u00f3\u017ca and Haim Lebenstein, and Wanda reveals that it is unknown where or if they were buried. Wanda asks her what would happen if she goes to their bodies and discovers that God is not there. Wanda takes her to the house they were born in and used to own, now occupied by a Christian farmer, Feliks Skiba, and his family. During the war, the Skibas had taken over the home and land and hidden the Lebensteins from the German authorities. Wanda demands that Feliks tell her where his father is to tell her what happened to her family. After some searching, Wanda and Ida find him close to death in a hospital, where he remembers R\u00f3\u017ca and speaks well of the Lebensteins but says little else. Wanda reveals to Ida that she had left her son Tadzio with R\u00f3\u017ca and Haim while she went to fight in the Polish Resistance and that he presumably died alongside them, robbing her of the opportunity of getting to know him. Feliks does not want his father to die feeling guilty of murder and asks them to keep his father out of their search. Instead, he agrees to tell them where the bodies are buried if Ida promises to leave the Skibas alone and give up any claim to the house and land. Feliks takes the women to the burial place in the woods and digs up the bones of their family. He admits to Ida that he took them into the woods and killed them. Feliks says that because Ida was very small and able to pass for a Christian, he gave her to a convent. But Wanda's small son was \"dark and circumcised,\" and, as he couldn't pass for a Christian child, Feliks had killed him along with Ida's parents. Wanda and Ida take the bones to their family burial plot, in an abandoned, overgrown Jewish cemetery in Lublin, and bury them. Wanda and Ida then part ways and return to their previous existences and routines, but they both have been profoundly affected by their experience. Although Wanda continues to drink and engage in apparently meaningless casual sex, she is also now mourning not only the loss of her son and sister but now also her niece. Ida returns to the convent but is visibly thoughtful about her life and decides she is not yet ready to take her solemn vows. Wanda's melancholy deepens, and she ultimately jumps to her death out of her apartment window. Ida returns to Warsaw and attends Wanda's burial, where she sees Lis again. At Wanda's apartment, Ida changes out of her novitiate's habit and into Wanda's stilettos and evening gown, tries smoking and drinking, and then goes to Lis's gig, where he later teaches her to dance. They kiss. After the show, Ida and Lis sleep together.

{"id": "91_1107", "question": "What genre is Point of View?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The names of the two inside line backers are often called Sam and Mike and these two are lined up about four yards from the line of scrimmage and are lined up with the offensive guard. The inside line backers are often more of a run player so they will defend the run before they will the pass. These line backers will be reading the offensive guard so they know what to do, so if the guard sets up to pass block the line backers know to get into their zone in order to cover the pass. If the guard come out for a run play they know that they need to fill the gap that they are supposed to so that they can make a play if it comes to them. Also, these inside line backers are often called on a blitz which is when no matter what the offense does, as soon as that ball is snapped they are shooting their gap and trying to get into the back field to make a play as fast as possible. Outside line backers sometimes are considered to be pass players before they are run players. But that depends on where they are lined up, if they are outside of the box of the defense then they will be pass first players, but if they play inside the box lined up behind the defensive end then they are typically a run player.

Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he'd done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, \"We're doing some squeaky clean, sweet, optimistic, non-cynical piece, I wanted to do something that sorta tapped into the different side of my personality.\" Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. He said, \"You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards.\" The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. In February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Murphy and Falchuk, with both as episode writers and Murphy as director.

{"id": "91_1120", "question": "What genre is The Visitor?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24563", "text": "As the \"first true megamusical\", Cats pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals\u00a0\u2014 including Les Mis\u00e9rables , The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon \u2014 that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained: Cats introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting\u00a0\u2014 and then aggressively promoting\u00a0\u2014 a single recognisable image as the face of the show. The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline to create what The Daily Telegraph called \"one of musical theatre's greatest posters\". Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for Les Mis\u00e9rables and the Phantom's mask for The Phantom of the Opera. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called \"critic-proof\" status of megamusicals. Additionally, Cats was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official Cats t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry. Beyond the megamusical, Cats also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: \"Cats is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped. People do want a theatrical experience for their children.\" Thanks to its easily accessible spectacle, the original Broadway production also tapped into the then-burgeoning tourist boom in New York and its audience shifted increasingly towards foreign visitors in its later years. Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to Cats, citing the latter's disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience. The musical's fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey's pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an \"architectural manner\", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of Cats was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre. Cats opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote: In the 1980s, the success of local productions of Cats in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit. The musical was also a boon for the Broadway touring industry. In 1997, The New York Times credited the regional and touring productions of Cats with \"almost single-handedly reviv[ing] the sagging road business\". Cats revolutionised the touring business by introducing the now commonplace practice of extended touring engagements that can last several weeks or months in a single city, as opposed to the typical one-week or ten-day tour stop. Mackintosh's insistence that all touring productions of Cats replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical's demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, he sometimes took elements from one and converted them to the other.  Krulik writes:  \"This imposition of science upon magic, and its reverse, forms a fascinating conflict that is apparent in his writings.\"  In Doorways Zelazny changes three fantasy elements into science fiction elements. Jewels with supernatural properties are a staple in fantasy.  In Zelazny's Amber series the Jewel of Judgment plays a decisive role in the plot.  In Jack of Shadows, Jack is imprisoned in a jewel that is worn around the neck by another character, the Lord of Bats. Zelazny takes the jewel fantasy motif and revises it into the star-stone in Doorways.  Instead of having magical qualities, the star-stone is described in the vocabulary of science:  To function properly, [Speicus] requires a host built along our lines.  It exists then as a symbiote within that creature, obtaining data by means of that being's nervous system as it goes about its business.  It operates on this material as something of a sociological computer.  In return for this, it keeps its host in good repair indefinitely.  On request, it provides analyses of anything it has encountered directly or peripherally, along with reliability figures, unbiased because it is uniquely alien to all life forms, yet creature-oriented because of the nature of the input mechanism.  It prefers a mobile host with a fact-filled head. Another fantasy element that Zelazny converts to science fiction is Alice's looking glass.  Looking through her mirror Alice observes that objects are the same as in her drawing room, but \". . . the things go the other way.\"  A book held up to a mirror in the right hand has reversed writing in the mirror and the book is in the left hand of the mirror image of the person on the other side of the looking glass.  The mirror reverses the image from one side to the other. In Doorways Zelazny reimagines Alice's looking glass as the Rhennius machine, the device given to man by the aliens that reverses objects into their mirror images.  At Speicus' urging Fred puts himself through the machine.  The left side of his body is on the right and vice versa.  Also left becomes right and vice versa, and writing is backwards for Fred. And finally, Zelazny reenvisions another Alice artifact in Fred's mind.  In Alice the White Rabbit goes down the rabbit hole which leads to Wonderland.  While Fred is being tortured in the Australian desert, he looks around for a doorway in the sand, a passageway that will take him out of his surreal nightmare back to his normal world. However, at the end of Doorways Zelazny revises the rabbit hole again.  Fred imagines all the doorways in the sand that will lead to all the exotic places he and Speicus will visit and experiences that they will have throughout the galaxy:  \"Behind me the beach was suddenly full of doorways, and I thought of ladies, tigers, shoes, ships, sealing wax. . . .\"Carroll 1865, p. 235", "hasanswer": false}]}

Producer Sasha Harari wanted filmmaker Oliver Stone to write the screenplay but never heard back from his agent. After two unsatisfactory scripts were produced, Imagine Films replaced Columbia. Harari contacted Stone again and the director met with the surviving band members, telling them he wanted to keep a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended by this and exercised their right of approval over the director, rejecting Stone. By 1989, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who owned Carolco Pictures, had acquired the rights to the project and wanted Stone to direct it. The Doors had seen Stone's film Platoon and were impressed with what he had done, and Stone agreed to make the film after his next project, Evita. After spending years working on Evita and courting both Madonna and Meryl Streep to play the titular role, the film fell apart over salary negotiations with Streep and Stone quickly moved into pre-production for The Doors.

{"id": "91_1144", "question": "What genre is Grease?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_21387", "text": "Grease is a 1971 musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey. Named after the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers, the musical is set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School and follows ten working-class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure, politics, personal core values, and love. The score borrows heavily from the sounds of early rock and roll. In its original production in Chicago, Grease was a raunchy, raw, aggressive, vulgar show. Subsequent productions sanitized it and toned it down.  The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy, peer pressure and gang violence; its themes include love, friendship, teenage rebellion, sexual exploration during adolescence, and, to some extent, class consciousness and class conflict. Jacobs described the show's basic plot as a subversion of common tropes of 1950s cinema, since the female lead, who in many 1950s films transformed the alpha male into a more sensitive and sympathetic character, is instead drawn into the man's influence and transforms into his wild, roguish fantasy. Grease was first performed in 1971 in the original Kingston Mines nightclub in Chicago . From there, it has been successful on both stage and screen, but the content has been diluted and its teenage characters have become less Chicago habitu\u00e9s and more generic. At the time that it closed in 1980, Greases 3,388-performance run was the longest yet in Broadway history, although it was surpassed by A Chorus Line on September 29, 1983. It went on to become a West End hit, a successful feature film, two popular Broadway revivals in 1994 and 2007, and a staple of regional theatre, summer stock, community theatre, and high school and middle school drama groups. It remains Broadway's 16th longest-running show. Grease was adapted in 1978 as a feature film also named Grease, which removed some plot elements, characters, and songs while adding new songs and elaborating on some plot elements only alluded to in the musical. Some of these revisions have been incorporated into revivals of the musical . A 2016 live TV musical used elements from both the original stage version and the film. A 1982 film sequel, Grease 2, included only a few supporting characters from the film and musical and had no involvement from Jacobs or Casey.

{"id": "91_1147", "question": "What genre is Kiss?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_38504", "text": "From the start of writing the Buffy series, Joss Whedon asserted that it would never have a \"very special episode\" as in contemporary series Beverly Hills, 90210, The Wonder Years, or Party of Five, where the core cast of characters addresses a single issue and resolve all the problems at the end. Whedon was not interested in finding a life-affirming lesson for \"The Body\". Rather, he wanted to capture the isolation and boredom involved in the minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died, what he termed \"the black ashes in your mouth numbness of death\". He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode. He tried to achieve an \"unlovely physicality\" in \"The Body\" to portray the upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible. Small details became significant: to protect her dignity, Buffy pulls the hem of Joyce's skirt down after it rode up when she attempted CPR; the camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while Buffy vomits; to emphasize Buffy's isolation, the scene has no exterior establishing shots of the house. The opening sequence of \"The Body\" was also the closing scene of the previous episode, \"I Was Made to Love You\"; this is the only episode in the series that was first aired without a \"Previously on Buffy\" lead-in. The Christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast the stark reality of the rest of the episode, and to avoid having the credits appear over the beginning scenes where Buffy is trying to revive her mother. The episode is presented in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar . Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move through the house and calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, \"We're not supposed to move the body!\" Both Gellar and Trachtenberg were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, \"you try to separate it as best you can and at the same time it adds that extra layer\". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar \"at a fever pitch\", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure. Kristine Sutherland was informed during the third season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended to spend time in Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of \"The Body\" was strange and tense because she had been a regular character through the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies. The most difficult scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession about what to wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene. Whedon's rejection of the \"very special episode\" format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within \"The Body\". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the \"lesbian kiss episode\" in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it the primary focus of the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was \"not negotiable\". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was \"true to character\" and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so. When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in \"The Body\", saying \"They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy.\" Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was \"truly groundbreaking\"; no long speech, no huge discovery: \"Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world\". Tropiano calls it \"A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do.\" Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers \"the heart of the experience\" and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the \"whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters\". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality of dealing with the crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Originally aired by the Fox network on February\u00a013, 2000, \"Closure\" received a Nielsen rating of 9.1 and was seen by 15.35 million viewers. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics; many felt that the final reveal was emotional and powerful, although some were unhappy with the resolution.

It contained the remains of his brother Lawrence and other family members, but the decrepit brick vault needed repair, prompting Washington to leave instructions in his will for the construction of a new vault. Washington's estate at the time of his death was worth an estimated $780,000 in 1799, approximately equivalent to $17.82million in 2021. Washington's peak net worth was $587.0\u00a0million, including his 300 slaves. Washington held title to more than 65,000 acres of land in 37 different locations. In 1830, a disgruntled ex-employee of the estate attempted to steal what he thought was Washington's skull, prompting the construction of a more secure vault. The next year, the new vault was constructed at Mount Vernon to receive the remains of George and Martha and other relatives. In 1832, a joint Congressional committee debated moving his body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol. The crypt had been built by architect Charles Bulfinch in the 1820s during the reconstruction of the burned-out capital, after the Burning of Washington by the British during the War of 1812. Southern opposition was intense, antagonized by an ever-growing rift between North and South; many were concerned that Washington's remains could end up on \"a shore foreign to his native soil\" if the country became divided, and Washington's remains stayed in Mount Vernon. On October 7, 1837, Washington's remains were placed, still in the original lead coffin, within a marble sarcophagus designed by William Strickland and constructed by John Struthers earlier that year. The sarcophagus was sealed and encased with planks, and an outer vault was constructed around it. The outer vault has the sarcophagi of both George and Martha Washington; the inner vault has the remains of other Washington family members and relatives.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Many allegorical parallels can be drawn between the film's plot and the main tenets of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. The violence of the marauders preventing the former slaves from settling their own land parallels the housing and property ownership issues of the 1960s. Additionally, the film comments on the systemic racism of the twentieth century by depicting a conversation between the leader of the marauders and a sheriff. Essentially, the point of the conversation is to illustrate that although there are laws in place to prevent racism and violence, the lack of enforcement of those laws makes them useless, in effect. There is even one scene where it is implied an egalitarian white sheriff gets literally stabbed in the back by one of the racist \"eastermen\"! The film also has themes shared by other Blaxploitation films in regards to its depiction of white people and how they interact with African Americans. Not only does the film depict most white people as being sadistic, there is a specific scene in which Preacher uses a racist stereotype to fool the night riders into a sense of comfort. He improvises an over-the-top sermon to get the white men to laugh and let their guards down, and as soon as they do, Buck enters and kills everyone at the table. This usage of racist stereotypes by oppressed people can be seen in other Black Power films such as The Spook Who Sat by the Door.

She began writing in her early thirties while completing a dissertation in English literature about gay and lesbian fiction from the 1870s onward. Not enjoying expository writing, she attempted fiction and finding that she liked it, followed Tipping the Velvet with Affinity, another Victorian-set novel with gothic themes, and Fingersmith, also Victorian yet more of a Dickensian crime drama. All three have significant lesbian themes and characters; Waters often labels them as \"Victorian lesbo romps\". To avoid being pigeonholed as a niche writer, however , she followed these with The Night Watch, which also has gay and lesbian characters, but is set in the 1940s. For The Little Stranger, Waters diverted from overt lesbian themes, but incorporated other elements from previous books. A character in Affinity talks to spirits of the dead; the setting of Fingersmith is a large country estate inhabited by a small family and house staff; The Night Watch is set in post-WWII Britain with characters who are somewhat at a loss with what to do following the upheaval of war. Barry Didock in The Herald considers The Night Watch a companion piece to The Little Stranger. Waters states that the change from a conservative to socialist society was her true impetus for writing The Little Stranger: \"I didn't set out to write a haunted house novel. I wanted to write about what happened to class in that post-war setting. It was a time of turmoil in exciting ways. Working class people had come out of the war with higher expectations. They had voted in the Labour government. They want change.... So it was a culture in a state of change. But obviously for some people it was a change for the worse.\" She had originally set out to rewrite a version of The Franchise Affair by Josephine Tey, which is a courtroom thriller about a middle-class family accused of kidnapping a young girl. Waters is well known for the immense amount of research she conducts for her novels. Groundwork for The Night Watch also found its way into The Little Stranger; after this probing she concluded 1947 was \"a miserable year\". Much of her time preparing for this novel was spent in Warwickshire estate homes and local newspaper archives. She told The Globe and Mail I read a lot of novels from the period. And diaries were a wonderful resource. I also watched films from that period and went to museums and archives to look at ephemera from the period. I like to try to capture the idiom and slang... A writer at that time wouldn't have used profanity in a respectable novel. But if you look at diaries or letters, people were swearing all the time, in very modern-sounding ways. One of the excitements about writing about the past from the present is that you can put in a lot of the details that the mainstream novelists of the time couldn't because of the conventions of the time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1164", "question": "What genre is Jazz?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_53126", "text": "Lonnie Liston Smith Jr. is an American jazz, soul, and funk musician who played with such jazz artists as Pharoah Sanders and Miles Davis before forming Lonnie Liston Smith and the Cosmic Echoes, recording a number of albums widely regarded as classics in the fusion, smooth jazz and acid jazz genres. Early career Smith was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, United States to a musical family; his father was a member of Richmond Gospel music group The Harmonizing Four, and he remembered groups such as the Swan Silvertones and the Soul Stirrers as regular visitors to the house when he was a child. He studied piano, tuba and trumpet in high school and college before receiving a B.S. in music education from Morgan State University in Baltimore in 1961. Smith has cited Charlie Parker, John Coltrane and Miles Davis as major influences in his youth. While still a teenager, Smith became well known locally as a backing vocalist as well as pianist in the Baltimore metropolitan area. During this period, he regularly performed with a number of his contemporaries, including Gary Bartz , Grachan Moncur , and Mickey Bass . He also backed a number of jazz singers while performing in the house band at Baltimore's Royal Theater shortly after receiving his degree. In 1963, he moved to New York City, where he initially played piano in Betty Carter's band for a year. Early in 1965, Smith began playing with Roland Kirk, first recording with his band on Here Comes The Whistleman , an album recorded live in New York on March 14, 1965. A further track from that gig, \"Dream\", appeared on Roland Kirk and Al Hibbler's live album A Meeting Of The Times . Late in 1965, Smith joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, sharing the piano position with Mike Nock and Keith Jarrett. The Jazz Messengers, together with Miles Davis' group, were one of the main proving grounds for young up-and-coming jazz musicians, experimentally edgy and musically stretching, and both were an ever-revolving door of young modern jazz musicians as modes and moods rapidly changed during a fresh period of experimentation. Beginning with a live session at The Five Spot, New York City, November 9, 1965, Smith's time as a Jazz Messenger was fairly short-term, only lasting until a three-gig engagement at The Village Vanguard 26\u201328 April 1966; by May 1966 his position was filled by Chick Corea. No recordings exist of this period. In May 1967, Smith returned to working with Roland Kirk for the album sessions for Now Please Don't You Cry, Beautiful Edith before continuing his career as pianist for a year with drummer Max Roach . Following this stint, Smith moved to Pharoah Sanders' ensemble early in 1968, a group Sanders had set up on the death of John Coltrane the previous year. Fiercely improvisational, Sanders pushed the band creatively to the boundaries of free jazz, recording three of Sanders' finest recordings: Karma , Jewels of Thought and Thembi , together with 1969 recording sessions not released until 1973 as Izipho Zam . It is at this point that Smith began experimenting with electric keyboards: On Thembi, that was the first time that I ever touched a Fender Rhodes electric piano. We got to the studio in California \u2014 Cecil McBee had to unpack his bass, the drummer had to set up his drums, Pharoah had to unpack all of his horns. Everybody had something to do, but the piano was just sitting there waiting. I saw this instrument sitting in the corner and I asked the engineer, 'What is that?' He said, 'That\u2019s a Fender Rhodes electric piano.' I didn\u2019t have anything to do, so I started messing with it, checking some of the buttons to see what I could do with different sounds. All of a sudden I started writing a song and everybody ran over and said, 'What is that?' And I said, 'I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just messing around.' Pharoah said, 'Man, we gotta record that. Whatcha gonna call it?' I\u2019d been studying astral projections and it sounded like we were floating through space so I said let\u2019s call it 'Astral Traveling.' That\u2019s how I got introduced to the electric piano. During this period, Smith also backed Sanders vocalist Leon Thomas on his first album Spirits Known and Unknown . Having already guested on Gato Barbieri's 1969 album The Third World , Smith joined Barbieri's band from 1971 to 1973. Barbieri had by then begun to temper his free jazz excursions of the 1960s with softer Afro-Cuban and South American textures in his music, which would influence Smith's playing into new directions in the following years. Smith played on a number of albums marking this transition, Fenix , the live album El Pampero , Bolivia and Under Fire . One further recording, El Gato , was released after Smith had again moved on; from 1972 he had also taken up the invitation to join Miles Davis band on electric keyboards. Over the next year, during an intense period of studio recording by Davis, various line-ups laid down a considerable number of sessions, which were later inter-cut and remixed for final release. Miles Davis insisted that Smith learn to play the organ for the sessions: \"Miles gave me two nights to learn how to make music on the thing. Miles liked to introduce new sounds in a surprising way \u2014 that's how he produced such innovative, fresh music.\" Smith's contributions appeared on On The Corner and the track \"Ife\" on Big Fun . The Cosmic Echoes and solo work While passing through Miles Davis' ever-changing line-up, Smith had finally formed his own group, 'Lonnie Liston Smith and the Cosmic Echoes' in 1973, together with his partner in Pharoah Sanders group, Cecil McBee, on bass, George Barron , Joe Beck , David Lee, Jr. , James Mtume , Sonny Morgan , Badal Roy , and Geeta Vashi . Blending atmospheric fusion, soul and funk, Smith was encouraged by Bob Thiele, the owner of Flying Dutchman Records, who had produced both Pharoah Sanders' and Gato Barbieri's output while Smith had been in their bands, the latter for Thiele's newly formed label. For his debut album, Astral Traveling , Smith re-recorded the title song he had composed and played on with the Pharoah Sanders band two years previous. An instrumental album, Astral Travelling also contained a re-arrangement of the gospel standard \"Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord\", which Smith had also previously arranged for Sanders. The following year Smith's brother, Donald, joined the Cosmic Echoes as vocalist for Cosmic Funk . Although he remained close to his earlier roots with featured versions of Wayne Shorter's \"Footprints\" and John Coltrane's \"Naima\" on this album, by now Smith was heading into the smooth jazz funk/fusion style that would dominate his output from here on, with dreamy vocals and long, spacy instrumental passages underlaid by strong funky bass-lines and a distinctive use of light percussion, with a message of peace and tranquillity in both the lyrics and song titles. \"I was trying to expand the consciousness of humanity\" explained Smith in an interview in 2009. This attitude may not have endeared Smith to the hardcore free jazz fans who had appreciated his earlier work, but this new relaxed fusion style proved popular with a cross-over audience not normally associated with jazz, and the following albums, Expansions , Visions of a New World and Reflections of a Golden Dream have since become mainstays of the jazz-funk and chill jazz genres with DJs and audiences worldwide, especially in Europe and Japan. Renaissance continued this crossover fame, and the following year Smith expanded upon his success with a new contract with Columbia Records and two further crossover albums in Loveland and Exotic Mysteries , the latter containing the single \"Space Princess\" which became a disco/R&B hit popular in clubs today in both 7\" and remixed 12\" versions. \"Space Princess\" was written by, and featured the bass lines of 16-year-old Marcus Miller, who was discovered by Smith and also wrote the track \"Night Flower\" on Exotic Mysteries. A further track from the same album, \"Quiet Moments\", was to become a mainstay of the smooth jazz genre over the next decade. After the crossover success of the 1970s, and continuing interest in and discovery of his earlier work by fans of the new \"Quiet Storm\" late-night radio/smooth jazz format, Smith moved to Bob Thiele's new label, Doctor Jazz, and had a minor hit in 1983 with \"Never Too Late\". He also appeared in Marvin Gaye's backing band at the 1980 Montreux Jazz Festival, which has since been released on both CD and DVD . However, public interest slowly waned in his newer material as the decade wore on, and the Cosmic Echoes eventually dissipated around 1976. The story of how Smith came to join Bob Thiele at Thiele's new label is told on the LP cover notes to Dreams of Tomorrow by Leonard Feather. Clearly Smith was at a crossroads. The reuniting with Thiele brought Smith full circle for Thiele was partly responsible for supporting Smith's early work. Thiele's new record label 'Doctor Jazz' provided the perfect platform for Smith to showcase his new and critically acclaimed work of the early to mid 1980s. For Dreams of Tomorrow, Smith enlisted the vocal talents of his younger brother Donald Smith for the album's opener A Lonely Way To Be and side two's stunning opening Never Too Late. A major musician on the album was Marcus Miller on bass guitar. David Hubbard plays a series of saxophones and flutes on the album, with Yogi Horton, Buddy Williams and Steve Thornton leading on drums and percussion. The album relaunched Smith and the 'Doctor Jazz' albums are now considered amongst Smith's finest work. The Dreams of Tomorrow sessions were produced by Marcus Miller. Later career In October 1986, he moved closer to his musical roots with \"Make Someone Happy\" , an acoustic session that included new recordings of several jazz standards by the trio of Smith, Cecil McBee and Al Foster, produced by Bob Thiele. However, despite critical acclaim for this work, Smith found himself without a recording contract until the turn of the decade, when the small Startrak label released Love Goddess  and Magic Lady .  \"I had a lot of idealistic concepts about music, and about the spiritual message I was trying to get across. But most record companies only care about demographics and bottom line sales.\" Both of the Startrak albums marked an about turn to the smooth jazz mode of the Cosmic Echoes period, \"Love Goddess\" featuring vocalist Phyllis Hyman and saxophonist Stanley Turrentine. Around this time, the emerging hip-hop movement took an interest in Smith's earlier work, and he found himself working with rapper Guru, who was mixing hip-hop with jazz in an innovative way. \"Guru and the other rappers would tell me how their uncles used to make them listen to me and Miles and Donald Byrd and how they got the message\" Smith told Australia's Daily Telegraph Mirror  newspaper in 1995. Smith appeared on Guru's groundbreaking Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1 album , once again finding a new audience for his earlier work as a result. He had also toured Europe in 1991, but after this short period of activity Smith produced little further work in the 1990s. Despite extensive radio play, appearing on a number of compilation albums and being name-checked and sampled by an increasing number of younger musicians discovering his Cosmic Echoes output, he spent the next few years mainly involved in setting up his own label, Loveland, and it was not until 1998 that Sony International took advantage of his newfound audience by reissuing Exotic Mysteries and Loveland as a double CD. The same year, he recorded Transformation , once again revisiting the genre he had been most successful in and reuniting with his brother Donald's vocals. For this release he re-recorded \"A Chance For Peace \" and \"Expansions\" as well as \"Space Princess\". Since then he has not recorded, although he has performed live and toured on a number of occasions, especially in Europe and Japan, where he remains popular with new generations of listeners.  He has also spent much of his time teaching at various workshops. In 2002, Sony issued a double album retrospective of his Columbia output, Explorations: The Columbia Years, and his compositions remain a feature of jazz fusion orientated radio and CD compilations. The Cosmic Echoes track, \"Expansions\" has been featured in two videogames: Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Driver: Parallel Lines, while \"A Chance for Peace\" featured in Grand Theft Auto IV.

An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000. Shubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis. The actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence. Three scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K. Dick's \"Impostor\" and Clifford D. Simak's \"Immigrant\" as well as an original story called \"Botany Bay\", were supplied by Terry Nation, who would, a short time after, create the Daleks for Doctor Who.

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jada and Michael are friends and Michael asks her out but is politely rejected because Jada has a boyfriend, a gangster named Lorenzo. Lorenzo, coincidentally, drives by with buddies T-Bone and Baby Boy in the car and sees Michael talking to Jada. They stop and beat up Michael while a homeless man watches on silently from an alley. That night, Michael, tries to bring to life a doll he calls Killjoy, but seemingly, it doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s abducted by Lorenzo, T-Bone and Baby Boy and brought to a secluded area where he\u2019s \u201caccidentally\u201d shot. They leave his body. One year later: Jada is now seeing Jamal but is still dealing with her feelings for Lorenzo and Michael. Lorenzo is partying with T-Bone and Baby Boy and leaves to meet Kahara, his new girlfriend. T-Bone and Baby Boy encounter an ice cream truck with a clown inside who claims he sells drugs. Inviting them inside, Killjoy transports them to his lair, an abandoned warehouse. Baby Boy is rammed into the wall by the ice cream truck, killing him. T-Bone finds a lit blunt and smokes it, causing him to burst into flames and disappear. Their battered and burned corpses are shown together in Killjoy\u2019s lair. Meanwhile, at Kahara\u2018s apartment, Lorenzo investigates a noise at the door and sees a figure running off. He finds the ice cream truck parked outside and Killjoy pulls him inside and into his lair. He shoots Killjoy over a dozen times, but Killjoy absorbs the bullets into his body and shoots them out of his mouth, killing Lorenzo. Meanwhile, Jada and Jamal are called to Monique\u2019s apartment for an emergency. Once there, they find Monique with the homeless man from earlier who brings Jada up to speed on Michael and the gang members\u2018 fate and the origins of Killjoy who was brought to life by Michael\u2019s desire for revenge. Killjoy merged with Michael\u2019s spirit in order to gain more power, which he gets by killing. He also tells them that Killjoy can be destroyed by Jada, because the love of a young woman can destroy the evil in the heart. Before leaving, he tells them that they have to kill the doll the spirit came from, as the ice cream truck is conveniently parked outside. He then vanishes in front of them. They go to the truck and are pulled into Killjoy\u2019s warehouse, where they\u2019re confronted by undead versions of T-Bone, Baby Boy, and Lorenzo, who are now Killjoy's accomplices. The trios start fighting and Monique, Jada and Jamal are able to kill the henchmen again, their bodies disintegrating. Killjoy comes out, knocking out Jamal and Monique. He asks Jada for a kiss, which Jada agrees to, under one condition: that he will leave her world and never come back. But instead of disappearing, Killjoy transforms into Michael. Michael tells Jada that he did it all for her. Jada stabs Michael to death and he fades away. Jamal, Jada, and Monique are about to leave when Killjoy, Lorenzo, T-Bone, and Baby Boy appear behind them. The trio frantically run back into the ice cream truck and end up in Michael's house with the Killjoy doll on the floor, encircled by candles. The doll turns into Michael, who constantly begs her for forgiveness, but Jada stabs him and he turns back into the doll. A portal opens outside and Baby Boy, T-Bone, and Lorenzo's souls are sucked in. The trio then watch as Killjoy vaporizes Michael and are sent back to Jada's room, where the homeless man thanks them and vanishes again. The trio go out to eat where they are confronted by Ray Jackson, and Tamara, both from Jada's English class. Ray says that he gained access to the club for free because his brother owns the place. When they ask his brother\u2019s name he says Killjoy, laughs maniacally, then he and Tamara turn into Lorenzo and Killjoy, respectively, while Jada screams.

What a nice plump mouthful...\" After presenting a quote by The Brothers Grimm, the cold open shows a girl in a red sweatshirt running through the woods. She is attacked by a wolf-like creature, after she stops to check out a small figurine lying on the ground. Later that morning, police officer Nick Burkhardt , and his partner Hank Griffin , are discussing Nick's plans to propose to his girlfriend. A woman walks by and while looking at Nick, her face changes to that of a non-human creature. Hank appears not to notice anything. They are then called to investigate the murder of the runner. After visiting the murder scene, Nick and Hank are working at a station of the Portland Police Department. There is a man being processed by another detective, and when Nick looks at him, his face momentarily changes into that of a beast. Nick is again the only one who sees this transformation. Later that night, Nick comes to his home to find his girlfriend, to whom he is preparing to propose, Juliette Silverton , conversing with his aunt, Marie Kessler , who had just come to town with a trailer. Nick finds out that Marie is dying of breast cancer, and she informs him that he is one of the last in a long line of people called Grimms, who can see beasts reminiscent of those about which The Brothers Grimm wrote. She is later attacked by one of those beasts, and Nick manages to shoot the creature who, upon dying, transforms back to a human. Badly injured, Marie gives Nick a key, which he is supposed to protect with his life. At the hospital, Marie informs Nick more about his family and the Grimms, and she informs him that all he needs to know is in her trailer. He goes in the trailer that night and finds a various assortment of weapons and a book, which details encounters with various creatures and descriptions of what they are. When attempting to inform his aunt that he has previously seen some of the creatures about which he had read, he finds out she had slipped into a coma. Nick then is informed of a case in which a young girl wearing a red sweatshirt is attacked by a beast in the woods. He connects this to the previous case. At the crime scene, he follows a trail that leads him to the house of a man, Monroe , whom he arrests after seeing his face change. Monroe is found to be clean and then released, but Nick, being suspicious, returns to Monroe's house. After a scuffle, he has a conversation with Monroe, who turns out to be a reformed Blutbad, the same type of creature as the one that attacked the girls. Monroe agrees to help Nick solve the case. After following the scent of another Blutbad, Monroe leads Nick to the Blutbad's cabin in the woods. Monroe begins transforming against his own will and, fearing that he might attack either Nick or the girl, retreats. Nick calls in Hank to investigate the cabin, and the two of them enter the cabin. Hank is initially dismissive of Nick's thoughts, as the Blutbad appears to be a simple postman named Errol Ditmarsch. However, upon exiting the cabin, Hank realizes that Ditmarsch was humming the same song found on the dead girl's iPod: Sweet Dreams by The Eurythmics. They return to the cabin only to find the lights out, and nobody there. Then Ditmarsch attacks Hank in morphed form, but as he runs out of the cabin, Hank opens fire on him. Nick then tries to interrogate Ditmarsch about the girl's whereabouts, but Ditmarsch only says \"Grimm...\" before dying from his wounds. Nick and Hank return to the cabin, and Nick finds a secret passage to the cellar room, under the rug. As both of them enter the cellar room, they find the missing girl and return her to her home. At the hospital, the woman who transformed in front of Nick at the beginning of the episode arrives with a syringe. Realizing who she is, Nick intervenes and gets injected with the syringe instead of Marie. The woman escapes the hospital and meets up with Captain Renard; both of them had conspired to kill Marie. When Renard asks if Marie is dead, the woman says that because Nick was there to save Marie, Marie lived. Renard then tells her that they will have to try the attempt again in the hopes that Nick is not there and Marie is not conscious when they do so. As they drive away, Marie opens her eyes, having fully awakened from the coma. The episode's plot is reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford.

Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do.

Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status.

Upon formation, the Mentors began to tour the Northwest, playing shows with their trademark executioner hoods and bawdy lyrics. In the early days of the band, El Duce would contact venues saying they were a Kiss cover band and send them a dubbed cassette with Kiss songs on it and say it was them, on one occasion he sent a copy of Deep Purple Live in Japan to what they thought was a club. It was later revealed to be a pizza place and they ended up playing a kid's birthday party, they were forced to stop after one song and were eventually given $50. Broy was in and out of the band during its early career due to his preoccupation with pursuing a degree in engineering. Other bassists from this era include Jeff Dahl, Chris Jacobsen , and Mike Dewey . Through Mystic Records, the Mentors released their first EP, The Trash Bag, in 1983. Their first live album, Live at the Whiskey/Cathey de Grande, came out the following year; both records were produced by Phillip Raves. In 1985, they signed to Death Records, a subsidiary of Metal Blade, and released their debut studio LP, You Axed for It!, with Broy returning on the bass. During this time, Hoke maintained a strong public presence, making a controversial appearance alongside fellow metal band GWAR on The Jerry Springer Show, where Hoke's band, beliefs, and public image were criticized. The Mentors did not achieve true notoriety until the 1985 Congressional hearings orchestrated by Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center . The relatively obscure Mentors caught the attention of the PMRC with their song, \"Golden Shower\", prompting a reading of some of its lyrics on the Congressional floor. Broy was briefly replaced by bassists Wayne Daddio , Ed Danky , Lucinda Rezabek , and Keith McAdam , but later returned to the group. In 1989, the Mentors released their third album, Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll, a faux-live record. This album caught the attention of the hard rock band Revolting Cocks, who invited the Mentors on tour with them. They released Rock Bible in 1990, with Rick Lomas sitting in on drums. To the Max followed the next year. Clark Savage often filled in for Hoke on drums at live shows, as Hoke's alcoholism had made it difficult for him to play drums and sing simultaneously, eventually taking the position as drummer while Hoke became vocalist exclusively. The Mentors remained sporadically active thereafter. Hoke began a solo career, while Carlson formed the band Jesters of Destiny. In 1997, while being interviewed for the documentary film Kurt and Courtney, Hoke claimed that Courtney Love had offered him $50,000 to kill her husband Kurt Cobain, whose death was ruled a suicide. Two days after being interviewed, Hoke died after being struck by a freight train while intoxicated. His death was alternately described as an accident and a suicide, however, some conspiracy theorists have claimed there is evidence suggesting foul play. Carlson, Broy and Savage continued the band and were joined by guitarist Jeff Solberg and vocalist Jake Huber , releasing Over the Top in 2005. In 2006 Singer and drummer Marc DeLeon , of the Mentors tribute band The Mantors, replaced Huber and, later, Savage. 2009 saw the release of Ducefixion, their eighth full-length record. DeLeon left the Mentors in 2014 during the making of full-length documentary film called The Mentors: Kings of Sleaze Rockumentary, directed by April Jones.

{"id": "91_1181", "question": "What genre is Breathing?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_3638", "text": "During his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting\u2014rhetorically\u2014that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\". A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\". Poe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work in Continental Europe. Poe's early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H.\u00a0G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell. Horror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft stated, \"When I write stories, Edgar Allan Poe is my model.\" Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films\". Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators. One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook. Even so, Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\", and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\". Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"\u2014the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger. It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1967, the Keukdong Entertainment Company of South Korea, with production assistance from Toei Company, produced Yongary, Monster from the Deep, a reptilian monster who invades South Korea to consume oil. The film and character has often been branded as an imitation of Godzilla. Godzilla has been considered a filmographic metaphor for the United States, as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier Godzilla films, especially the original, portrayed Godzilla as a frightening nuclear-spawned monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence. As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character. Ghidorah was the turning point in Godzilla's transformation from villain to hero, by pitting him against a greater threat to humanity, King Ghidorah. Godzilla has since been viewed as an anti-hero. Roger Ebert cites Godzilla as a notable example of a villain-turned-hero, along with King Kong, Jaws , the Terminator and John Rambo. Godzilla is considered \"the original radioactive superhero\" due to his accidental radioactive origin story predating Spider-Man , though Godzilla did not become a hero until Ghidorah in 1964. By the 1970s, Godzilla came to be viewed as a superhero, with the magazine King of the Monsters in 1977 describing Godzilla as \"Superhero of the '70s.\" Godzilla had surpassed Superman and Batman to become \"the most universally popular superhero of 1977\" according to Donald F. Glut. Godzilla was also voted the most popular movie monster in The Monster Times poll in 1973, beating Count Dracula, King Kong, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, the Creature from the Black Lagoon and the Frankenstein Monster. In 1996, Godzilla received the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as being given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004 to celebrate the premiere of the character's 50th anniversary film, Godzilla: Final Wars. Godzilla's pop-cultural impact has led to the creation of numerous parodies and tributes, as seen in media such as Bambi Meets Godzilla, which was ranked as one of the \"50 greatest cartoons\", two episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and the song \"Godzilla\" by Blue \u00d6yster Cult. Godzilla has also been used in advertisements, such as in a commercial for Nike, where Godzilla lost an oversized one-on-one game of basketball to a giant version of NBA player Charles Barkley. The commercial was subsequently adapted into a comic book illustrated by Jeff Butler. Godzilla has also appeared in a commercial for Snickers candy bars, which served as an indirect promo for the 2014 film. Godzilla's success inspired the creation of numerous other monster characters, such as Gamera, Reptilicus of Denmark, Yonggary of South Korea, Pulgasari of North Korea, Gorgo of the United Kingdom and the Cloverfield monster of the United States. Dakosaurus is an extinct sea crocodile of the Jurassic Period, which researchers informally nicknamed \"Godzilla\". Paleontologists have written tongue-in-cheek speculative articles about Godzilla's biology, with Ken Carpenter tentatively classifying it as a ceratosaur based on its skull shape, four-fingered hands and dorsal scutes and paleontologist Darren Naish expressing skepticism, while commenting on Godzilla's unusual morphology. Godzilla's ubiquity in pop-culture has led to the mistaken assumption that the character is in the public domain, resulting in litigation by Toho to protect their corporate asset from becoming a generic trademark. In April 2008, Subway depicted a giant monster in a commercial for their Five Dollar Footlongs sandwich promotion. Toho filed a lawsuit against Subway for using the character without permission, demanding $150,000 in compensation. In February 2011, Toho sued Honda for depicting a fire-breathing monster in a commercial for the Honda Odyssey. The monster was never mentioned by name, being seen briefly on a video screen inside the minivan. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society christened a vessel the MV Gojira. Its purpose is to target and harass Japanese whalers in defense of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The MV Gojira was renamed the  in May 2011, due to legal pressure from Toho. Gojira is the name of a French death metal band, formerly known as Godzilla; legal problems forced the band to change their name. In May 2015, Toho launched a lawsuit against Voltage Pictures over a planned picture starring Anne Hathaway. Promotional material released at the Cannes Film Festival used images of Godzilla. Steven Spielberg cited Godzilla as an inspiration for Jurassic Park , specifically Godzilla, King of the Monsters! , which he grew up watching. Spielberg described Godzilla as \"the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies because it made you believe it was really happening.\" Godzilla also influenced the Spielberg film Jaws . Godzilla has also been cited as an inspiration by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Tim Burton. The main-belt asteroid 101781 Gojira, discovered by American astronomer Roy Tucker at the Goodricke-Pigott Observatory in 1999, was named in honor of the creature. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 11 July 2018 .", "hasanswer": false}]}

Roger Ebert reiterated Gene Siskel's earlier opinion, stating that the film was \"basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship.\" He described it as one of several science fiction pictures that were \"real disappointments\" compared to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, in both episodes Ebert singled out the early scene of the Nostromo crew exploring the alien planet for praise,  calling the scene \"inspired,\" said that it showed \"real imagination\" and claimed that it transcended the rest of the film. Over two decades later, Ebert had revised his opinion of the film, including it on his Great Movies list, where he gave it four stars and said \"Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original.\" In 1980, the film was included in Cinefantastiques list of the top films of the 1970s while failing to make the magazine's top ten. Frederick S. Clarke, the magazine's editor, wrote that Alien was \"an exercise in style, refreshingly adult in approach, wickedly grim and perverse, that manages to compensate for a lack of depth in both story and characters.\" In 1982, John Simon of the National Review praised the cast of Alien, particularly Sigourney Weaver, and the film's visual values. Simon also wrote, \"For fanciers of horror, among whose numbers I do not count myself, Alien is recommendable, provided they are free from hypocrisy and finicky stomachs\". Despite initial mixed reviews, Alien has received critical acclaim over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment, and is cited one of the best films of 1979. It is seen as one of the most influential science-fiction films. It holds a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 125 reviews and an average rating of 9.11/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A modern classic, Alien blends science fiction, horror and bleak poetry into a seamless whole.\" Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Halliwell's Film Guide awarded it a full four stars, describing it as \"a classic of suspense and art direction\". Alan Jones of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five, describing it as a \"revolutionary 'haunted house in space' thrill-ride [...] stunning you with shock after shock\", praising the \"top-notch acting [...] and imaginative bio-mechanical production design\", as well as \"Ridley Scott's eye for detail and brilliant way of alternating false scares with genuine jolts, which help to create a seamless blend of gothic horror and harrowing science fiction\". Critical interest in the film was re-ignited with the theatrical release of the \"Director's Cut\" in 2003. Roger Ebert ranked it among \"the most influential of modern action pictures\" and praised its pacing, atmosphere, and settings: David McIntee praises Alien as \"possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings.\" He notes that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: \"It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal.\" Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th , he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: \"The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.\" He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: \"Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim.\" David Edelstein wrote, \"Alien remains the key text in the 'body horror' subgenre that flowered in the seventies, and Giger's designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety. Men traveled through vulva-like openings, got forcibly impregnated, and died giving birth to rampaging gooey vaginas dentate \u2014 how's that for future shock? This was truly what David Cronenberg would call 'the new flesh,' a dissolution of the boundaries between man and machine, machine and alien, and man and alien, with a psychosexual invasiveness that has never, thank God, been equaled.\" In 2008, the American Film Institute ranked Alien as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre as part of AFI's 10 Top 10, a CBS television special ranking the ten greatest movies in ten classic American film genres. The ranks were based on a poll of over 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians, with Alien ranking just above Terminator 2: Judgment Day and just below Scott's other science fiction film Blade Runner . The same year, Empire magazine ranked it thirty-third on its list of the five hundred greatest movies of all time, based on a poll of 10,200 readers, critics, and members of the film industry. In 2021, Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number two in the \"25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made\".

Folha de S.Paulos S\u00e9rgio S\u00e1 Leit\u00e3o pointed out Sepultura's increasing compositional skills, drawing attention to how the band's occasional use of restraint benefited their songs as a whole. The international pop press also took notice of Brazil's premiere metal group. Top British weeklies such as the Melody Maker and NME wrote lengthy articles on the band, praising them. A Melody Maker journalist wrote: \"Sepultura is [...] a Brazilian metal band which seems to be in the verge of getting big \u2013 maybe even bigger than Slayer, their only true rival.\" Genre-specific magazines also reacted positively to the group. Germany's Thrash elected Sepultura the best band in the world, defeating major contenders Metallica and Slayer. Sepultura were also prominently featured on the biggest metal publications of the time, such as Kerrang!, Rock Hard and Metal Forces. Select gave the album a five out of five rating, referring to it as a \"a classic example of rock music as pure cathartic release\" and that \"few metal LPs released this year, if any, will triumph over Arise.\" Arise was the first Sepultura record to enter the Billboard charts, at number 145.

In November 1996, Q magazine stated that \"Arise remains their thrash high water mark, sounding like an angry man throwing tools at a urinal while reading the Book of Revelations [sic].\" AllMusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia considered Arise as \"a classic of the death metal genre.\" The album also appeared in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die , edited by writer Robert Dimery. In January 2016, 25 years since the album's release, Arise was inducted into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame, becoming the third Sepultura album to receive such award, the previous two being Roots and Beneath the Remains.

{"id": "91_1186", "question": "What genre is Frances?", "ctxs": [{"id": "422_52391", "text": "The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail. Other authors are known, for example Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who wrote in Occitan. Much medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the Matter of France, such as The Song of Roland and the various chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, whose novel Gargantua and Pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now. Michel de Montaigne was another major figure of French literature during that century. His most famous work, Essais, created the literary genre of the essay. French poetry during that century was embodied by Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Both writers founded the La Pl\u00e9iade literary movement. During the 17th century, Madame de La Fayette published anonymously La Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves, a novel that is considered to be one of the first psychological novels of all time. Jean de La Fontaine is one of the most famous fabulists of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as The Ant and the Grasshopper. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, which were seen as helping teach wisdom and common sense to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs, such as \"\u00c0 l'\u0153uvre, on conna\u00eet l'artisan.\"[A workman is known by his chips]. Jean Racine, whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as Ph\u00e8dre or Britannicus. He is, along with Pierre Corneille and Moli\u00e8re, considered one of the three great dramatists of France's golden age. Moli\u00e8re, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the Western literature, wrote dozens of plays, including Le Misanthrope, L'Avare, Le Malade imaginaire, as well as Le Bourgeois gentilhomme. His plays have been so popular around the world that the French language is sometimes dubbed as \"the language of Moli\u00e8re\" , just like English is considered \"the language of Shakespeare\". French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclop\u00e9die, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century and to present them to the people, to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as \"the greatest French writer of all time\" for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play Cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. Les Contemplations and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles are considered \"poetic masterpieces\", Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. His novel Les Mis\u00e9rables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas , Jules Verne , \u00c9mile Zola , Honor\u00e9 de Balzac , Guy de Maupassant, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier and Stendhal , whose works are among the most well known in France and the world. The Prix Goncourt is a French literary prize first awarded in 1903. Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry wrote Little Prince, which has remained popular for decades with children and adults around the world. , French authors had more Literature Nobel Prizes than those of any other nation. The first Nobel Prize in Literature was a French author, while France's latest Nobel prize in literature is Patrick Modiano, who was awarded the prize in 2014. Jean-Paul Sartre was also the first nominee in the committee's history to refuse the prize in 1964.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ministry has been classified under many other genres, including EBM/industrial dance, techno-rock, hard rock, heavy metal, speed metal, thrash metal, and electro-industrial; their early output has been categorised as new wave, synth-pop, dance-pop, electronic dance, and dark wave.  In the April 1989 issue of Spin Magazine, an author Michael Corcoran labelled the band as \"industrial disco\"; in 1994, writer Simon Glickman used this term as well. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that, previous to Nine Inch Nails' rise to mainstream popularity, \"Ministry did more than any other band to popularize industrial dance music, injecting large doses of punky, over-the-top aggression and roaring heavy metal guitar riffs that helped their music find favor with metal and alternative audiences outside of industrial's cult fan base.\" Despite frequent descriptions of the band's music as industrial,; . Jourgensen disputed the use of this tag in several publications since the early 1990s, preferring instead to identify his style as \"aggro\", and, much later \"industrious\". Despite Jourgensen's dislike of touring, Ministry are noted for their live performances, featuring extended versions of songs and disturbing visual imagery. MTV also recognized the band as an influential heavy metal act, highlighting the use of sampling during their heyday. Alternative Press included Ministry in their 1996 list of 100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years, stating that they merged \"metal, samples, synths, and the 100-mph sound of urban paranoia, they pretty much created industrial music as we know it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The opening sequence of \"The Body\" was also the closing scene of the previous episode, \"I Was Made to Love You\"; this is the only episode in the series that was first aired without a \"Previously on Buffy\" lead-in. The Christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast the stark reality of the rest of the episode, and to avoid having the credits appear over the beginning scenes where Buffy is trying to revive her mother. The episode is presented in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar . Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move through the house and calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, \"We're not supposed to move the body!\" Both Gellar and Trachtenberg were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, \"you try to separate it as best you can and at the same time it adds that extra layer\". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar \"at a fever pitch\", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure. Kristine Sutherland was informed during the third season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended to spend time in Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of \"The Body\" was strange and tense because she had been a regular character through the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies. The most difficult scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession about what to wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene. Whedon's rejection of the \"very special episode\" format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within \"The Body\". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the \"lesbian kiss episode\" in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it the primary focus of the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was \"not negotiable\". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was \"true to character\" and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so. When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in \"The Body\", saying \"They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy.\" Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was \"truly groundbreaking\"; no long speech, no huge discovery: \"Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world\". Tropiano calls it \"A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do.\" Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers \"the heart of the experience\" and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the \"whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters\". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality of dealing with the crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided to be happy with the results.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It had \"no motion picture lighting equipment, no grip equipment, no professional sound recording equipment\" to have a \"raw\" and realistic feel to it. The vast majority of the cast were adolescents, and Goi required that their parents be on the set during filming due to the graphic nature of the film. The majority of the cast were inexperienced or first-time actors. The casting was intentional, as Goi wanted the characters to be portrayed by non-recognizable actors for the film to have an \"air of reality.\" Rachel Quinn, a seventeen-year-old aspiring actress, and dancer got cast in the eponymous role of Megan Stewart. Amber Perkins, who had previously only done background work for television shows and commercials, was cast in the lead role of Amy Herman. This role marked her feature film debut. The role of the villain, Josh, was given to Australian actor Dean Waite. In the controversial photographs used in the film, Quinn is legitimately wearing the torture device. Quinn describes wearing the headgear as her worst memory of filming. She attests this is because it was physically uncomfortable and mentally traumatizing when she realized what she was portraying. As the photographs are reality-based, Quinn asked Goi to show her the inspiration behind them. Upon seeing the real-life photographs she was reenacting, she began crying on the set. Quinn spent several hours having the special effects for Megan's corpse reveal applied to her and had to wear oversized white contact lenses that essentially blinded her when shooting in the barrel. Goi was very particular about the makeup direction for Megan's corpse. He wanted the audience to be able to tell that it's her, that she looked realistically dead, and to show that she suffered tremendously in the process of dying. The basement scenes were challenging for Perkins. Quinn agreed to stay on the set, making it a more comfortable environment for her. Goi has stated that Waite's scenes were difficult to film for the actor. In particular, the rape scene of the Amy character was difficult for him, which required several reshoots.

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book.  showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed.

The distinctive location filming in the Napa Valley and the dry, wryly humorous tone of the scripts gave the series a personality of its own. The rivalry between Angela, Chase, and Richard stayed at the core of the show for several years, as more romantic entanglements spun around them. Lance and Cole found themselves not only caught up in their family battles for control of Falcon Crest, but were also competing for Melissa's affections. Like its counterparts, Falcon Crest employed memorable end-of-season cliffhangers to boost ratings. The 1982\u201383 season ended with the resolution of a murder mystery \"whodunit\" plot that had spanned most of the season. The killer was revealed in front of the entire cast, only to produce a handgun. Shots were fired as the camera panned away from the mansion, fading into the final scene of a rose-draped coffin being lowered into the ground, leaving the audience to wonder who had been killed. The third-season cliffhanger in 1984 involved a plane crash carrying most of the major characters, resulting in three of their deaths. A bomb explosion which ended the fourth season left Richard and Maggie in peril, and an earthquake that rippled through the valley ended the fifth season. The cliffhanger of the sixth season put Chase, Melissa, Richard, newcomer Dan Fixx and Maggie's baby in danger of drowning in the San Francisco Bay area. At the end of the seventh season, Melissa had finally wrested complete control of Falcon Crest away from Angela, while Richard was apparently murdered by \"The Thirteen\", a powerful group of shady businessmen whom he had turned against. Falcon Crest was a top ten series from 1982 to 1985 , airing after Dallas on Friday nights at 10:00\u00a0p.m. The series also frequently cast former Hollywood royalty in guest roles: Lana Turner, Gina Lollobrigida, Mel Ferrer, Cesar Romero, Robert Stack, Cliff Robertson, Celeste Holm, Lauren Hutton, Ursula Andress and Kim Novak all appeared on Falcon Crest. This aspect to the series seemed to be well-embraced by the producers, who at one stage instituted a rotating guest-star policy. Leslie Caron, Lauren Hutton, Eddie Albert, Eve Arden, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Ursula Andress all made appearances during the 1987\u20131988 season, as did Rod Taylor, who would remain with the series until its cancellation in 1990.

{"id": "91_1211", "question": "What genre is Junction?", "ctxs": [{"id": "182_67708", "text": "From the motorway junction Neuk\u00f6lln the route is currently being continued as A 113 in the direction of Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport [obsolete] and Dresden. Following the motorway junction Neuk\u00f6lln, the following sections are planned as A 100: AS Grenzallee - AS At Treptower Park AS Am Treptower Park - AS Storkower Street Any further possible closure of the motorway ring was eliminated from the Berlin land use plan. The construction of what later became an Autobahn began in April 1956, with the first spade cut for the highway between Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and Hohenzollerndamm. The routing of a ring road parallel to the Ringbahn was already provided for in the Hobrecht Plan of 1862, and in 1948 a freeway was included in the city planning corridor. On 4 July 1955 the Senate decided on a complete expressway ring, but the dedication as a highway did not happen until 1962. As it was planned as an urban expressway, the carriageways were initially narrower; the regulations provided for an overall width of 27 metres, with each lane 3.50 metres wide; and the junctions were closer together than is usual for an Autobahn. For example, near the Funkturm motorway triangle there is today a complex cluster of bridges, tunnels and exits, in a stretch of only a few hundred metres. This includes the 212-meter-long tunnel under the Rathenauplatz, opened in November 1958. The route also goes under the railway lines leading to Westkreuz station, and connects at the Funkturm Triangle with the AVUS which had existed since 1921, and hence with Autobahn A115. The Rudolf Wissell Bridge was built between 1959 and 1962. It stretches in a 930 metre arc over the tracks of the Berlin-Hamburg Railway and the Berlin-Lehrter Bahn as well as the Charlottenburger Spree river. It is the longest bridge in Berlin. Some of the connecting roads of the Charlottenburg motorway intersection are on the bridge itself; the Siemensdamm exit on one of the connecting curves is on the left side. The gap between the Charlottenburg-North triangle and AVUS and Halensee was closed on 20 December 1963 with the connection to the Funkturm triangle. The section to the junction Hohenzollerndamm junction towards Halensee was connected in 1961 to the emerging triangle. The further expansion then follows the land use plan in 1965, which provided a west tangent through the city. The southern part was extended to the motorway junction Sch\u00f6neberg - the intersection with the section A 103 of the west tangent. In the northern part of the ring road was extended to the junction Seestra\u00dfe - just before the planned intersection with the section A 105 of the West Tangent, but even this point never reached. The semi-ring, which was created until 1979, would have resulted in a complete enclosure of the West Berlin city with motorways with a western tangent through the Tiergarten. However, the further construction of the west tangent A 103 as a motorway did not take place. The construction of the tunnel Tiergarten Spreebogen in the same corridor took place from 1995 as a city street without crossing, which also has no connection to the originally planned crossroads. There are some special features on the southern branch. For example, the junction Schmargendorf as Wilmersdorf interchange with the section of the A 104 to Steglitz was built - both were downgraded as parts of a feeder to the A 100 in the course of the 2005 conversions, so that the long flyover connection ramps act unusually spacious. In 1974, the footbridge \"High Arch\" was added to this cross, the name of which was self-evident. The provisional exit Detmolder road led to the Detmold road parallel to today's highway - this was preserved as an exit, with the further construction of the highway then two more ramps, which end behind the old ramps at Heidelberger Platz, so that they traffic like two in each other intertwined half connection points with the same name. In the course of the car-friendly city, the intersecting Bundesallee was equipped with several tunnels in the 1960s, but this high-performance axle does not have its own connection to the ring road, but is reached via the exits and driveways Detmolder road west and the exit Wexstra\u00dfe east. The tunneling of the Innsbrucker Platz took a very long time from 1971 to 1979, whereby a complete connection point was created, which opens up important city centers via Martin-Luther-Stra\u00dfe and Hauptstra\u00dfe / Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe. The ramps of the Wexstra\u00dfe half-access point are integrated into the building at Innsbrucker Platz, with additional connecting routes between Wexstrasse ramparts and Innsbrucker Platz. To this accumulation and entwining of ramps is added that the lanes of the entrances and exits Innsbrucker Platz and the following Sch\u00f6neberger cross merge into each other. In the northern branch of the Jakob-Kaiser-Platz under the motorway junction Charlottenburg a special function. The rebuilt city ring was connected to the square in 1973, the gap closing over this away was only in 1979. The square continues to take over the gap in the ring road continues the lack of connection to the A 111 and at the same time connects the traffic axis Siemens dam / Nonnendammallee. In rush hour traffic, the short driveway Siemensdamm is often blocked at the triangle, and the traffic out of this traffic axis over the square away, and then to use the following driveway to the ring road. merge.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1218", "question": "What genre is Nineteen Eighty-Four?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_70666", "text": "The effect of Nineteen Eighty-Four on the English language is extensive; the concepts of Big Brother, Room 101, the Thought Police, thoughtcrime, unperson, memory hole , doublethink and Newspeak have become common phrases for denoting totalitarian authority. Doublespeak and groupthink are both deliberate elaborations of doublethink, and the adjective \"Orwellian\" means similar to Orwell's writings, especially Nineteen Eighty-Four. The practice of ending words with  is drawn from the novel. Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984, an asteroid was discovered by Anton\u00edn Mrkos and named after Orwell. In 1955, an episode of BBC's The Goon Show, 1985, was broadcast, written by Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes and based on Nigel Kneale's television adaptation. It was re-recorded about a month later with the same script but a slightly different cast. 1985 parodies many of the main scenes in Orwell's novel. In 1970, the American rock group Spirit released the song \"1984\" based on Orwell's novel. In 1973, ex-Soft Machine bassist Hugh Hopper released an album called 1984 on the Columbia label , consisting of instrumentals with Orwellian titles such as \u201cMiniluv,\u201d \u201cMinipax,\u201d \u201cMinitrue,\u201d and so forth. In 1974, David Bowie released the album Diamond Dogs, which is thought to be loosely based on the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. It includes the tracks \"We Are The Dead\", \"1984\" and \"Big Brother\". Before the album was made, Bowie's management had planned for Bowie and Tony Ingrassia to co-write and direct a musical production of Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, but Orwell's widow refused to give MainMan the rights. In 1977, the British rock band The Jam released the album This Is the Modern World, which includes the track \"Standards\" by Paul Weller. This track concludes with the lyrics \"...and ignorance is strength, we have God on our side, look, you know what happened to Winston.\" In 1984, Ridley Scott directed a television commercial, \"1984\", to launch Apple's Macintosh computer. The advert stated, \"1984 won't be like 1984\", suggesting that the Apple Mac would be freedom from Big Brother; i.e., the IBM PC. An episode of Doctor Who, called \"The God Complex\", depicts an alien ship disguised as a hotel containing Room 101-like spaces, and quotes the nursery rhyme as well. The two part episode Chain of Command on Star Trek: The Next Generation bears some resemblances to the novel. Radiohead\u2019s 2003 single \u201c2 + 2 = 5\u201d, from their album Hail to the Thief, is Orwellian by title and content. Thom Yorke states, \u201cI was listening to a lot of political programs on BBC Radio 4. I found myself writing down little nonsense phrases, those Orwellian euphemisms that [the British and American governments] are so fond of. They became the background of the record.\u201d In September 2009, the English progressive rock band Muse released The Resistance, which included songs influenced by Nineteen Eighty-Four. In Marilyn Manson\u2019s autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, he states: \"I was thoroughly terrified by the idea of the end of the world and the Antichrist. So I became obsessed with it... reading prophetic books like... 1984 by George Orwell...\" English band Bastille references the novel in their song \"Back to the Future,\" the fifth track on their 2022 album Give Me the Future, in the opening lyrics: \"Feels like we danced into a nightmare/We're living 1984/If doublethink's no longer fiction/We'll dream of Huxley's Island shores.\" References to the themes, concepts and plot of Nineteen Eighty-Four have appeared frequently in other works, especially in popular music and video entertainment. An example is the worldwide hit reality television show Big Brother, in which a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world but continuously watched by television cameras. In November 2011, the US government argued before the US Supreme Court that it wants to continue utilising GPS tracking of individuals without first seeking a warrant. In response, Justice Stephen Breyer questioned what that means for a democratic society by referencing Nineteen Eighty-Four. Justice Breyer asked, \"If you win this case, then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States. So if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like Nineteen Eighty-Four...\u00a0\" The book touches on the invasion of privacy and ubiquitous surveillance. From mid-2013 it was publicised that the NSA has been secretly monitoring and storing global internet traffic, including the bulk data collection of email and phone call data. Sales of Nineteen Eighty-Four increased by up to seven times within the first week of the 2013 mass surveillance leaks. The book again topped the Amazon.com sales charts in 2017 after a controversy involving Kellyanne Conway using the phrase \"alternative facts\" to explain discrepancies with the media. The book also shows mass media as a catalyst for the intensification of destructive emotions and violence. Since the 20th century, news and other forms of media have been publicising violence more often. In 2013, Nottingham Playhouse, the Almeida Theatre and Headlong staged a successful new adaptation , which twice toured the UK and played an extended run in London's West End. The play opened on Broadway in New York in 2017. A version of the production played on an Australian tour in 2017. Nineteen Eighty-Four was number three on the list of \"Top Check Outs Of All Time\" by the New York Public Library. In accordance with copyright law, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm both entered the public domain on 1 January 2021 in most of the world, 70 calendar years after Orwell died.

Lobell explained that he went to Bergman with the story idea, which then led to Bergman penning the script. Bergman, for his part, told William Wolf, of New York, that after being taken on a tour of the Garment District, he was taken by the chaotic nature of the environment, and imagined how a college professor like himself would have managed if forced into such hectic surroundings, and the plot developed from the juxtaposition of a crazed world with an ordered personality. So Fine also received positive pre-release attention due to the main plot device, the see-through buttocks of the jeans . Costume designer Santo Loquasto said he'd intentionally constructed the design as a sendup of those coming out of \u201cFashion Avenue,\u201d the stretch of Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, which runs through the traditional Garment District. In one scene, an elaborate commercial for the jeans, choreographed by Grover Dale, plays out. Loquasto had designed a custom set, wildly illuminated and featuring dozens of models in the see-through jeans, arching towards the camera. Loquasto amusedly observed that despite he and the filmmakers intentionally aiming to be outrageous, he was amazed to regularly return from the set and find television commercials he felt were even more so. Wolf reporting in a piece published several months before So Fine\u2019s release, visited the Filmways Studio and found the pairing of Richard Kiel and Mariangela Melato entertaining in a scene he viewed. Wolf's article highly praised Bergman, considering him one of the few positive contributors to the comedy genre in film. Bergman's previous writing credits were for Blazing Saddles and The In-Laws, neither of which Bergman had felt positively about, yet both of which were commercial and critical successes. In a New York interview, Bergman said that after his experiences with Blazing Saddles and The In-Laws, he was sure that So Fine was going to be a big hit, so he decided that he would direct the film, in order to be certain that what he thought of as a surefire screenplay would transition to the big screen with his vision intact. Pre-screenings were positive, but two weeks after the film's release , Bergman was disappointed to see the film gone from the theaters. Bergman attributed the failure to the high-brow styling of his comedy being mismatched with its low-brow trappings. O'Neal was cast at the suggestion of Warner Bros.

Angel was originally conceived as supernatural noir.

The cover of the cassette version mirrored the image. A yield sign is hidden in every picture of the liner notes booklet.

Ament said that the cover came from the idea on \"how cool to have a yield sign where there's nothing to yield to\", and the place was a road on the way to his Montana home which he considered perfect for the photo.

He sculpted the creature's body using plasticine, incorporating pieces such as vertebrae from snakes and cooling tubes from a Rolls-Royce. The creature's head was manufactured separately by Carlo Rambaldi, who had worked on the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Rambaldi followed Giger's designs closely, making some modifications to incorporate the moving parts that would animate the jaw and inner mouth. A system of hinges and cables was used to operate the creature's rigid tongue, which protruded from its mouth and featured a second mouth at its tip with its own set of movable teeth. The final head had about 900 moving parts and points of articulation. Part of a human skull was used as the \"face\", and was hidden under the smooth, translucent cover of the head. Rambaldi's original Alien jaw is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution, while in April 2007, the original Alien suit was sold at auction. Copious amounts of K-Y Jelly were used to simulate saliva and to give the Alien an overall slimy appearance. The creature's vocalizations were provided by Percy Edwards, a voice artist famous for providing bird sounds for British television throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the whale sounds for Orca: Killer Whale . For most of the film's scenes, the Alien was portrayed by Bolaji Badejo. A latex costume was made to fit Badejo's slender  frame by taking a full-body plaster cast. Scott later commented that the Alien \"takes on elements of the host \u2013 in this case, a man.\" Badejo attended t'ai chi and mime classes  to create convincing movements for the Alien. For some scenes, such as when the Alien lowers itself from the ceiling to kill Brett, the creature was portrayed by stuntmen Eddie Powell and Roy Scammell\u2014Powell, in costume, was suspended on wires and then lowered in an unfurling motion. Scott chose not to show the full Alien for most of the film, keeping most of its body in shadow to create a sense of terror and heighten suspense. The audience could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: \"Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like.\" Scott said: The Alien has been referred to as \"one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history\", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that \"Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane .

This defensive scheme is often played with two inside line backers and two outside line backers. The names of the two inside line backers are often called Sam and Mike and these two are lined up about four yards from the line of scrimmage and are lined up with the offensive guard. The inside line backers are often more of a run player so they will defend the run before they will the pass. These line backers will be reading the offensive guard so they know what to do, so if the guard sets up to pass block the line backers know to get into their zone in order to cover the pass. If the guard come out for a run play they know that they need to fill the gap that they are supposed to so that they can make a play if it comes to them. Also, these inside line backers are often called on a blitz which is when no matter what the offense does, as soon as that ball is snapped they are shooting their gap and trying to get into the back field to make a play as fast as possible. Outside line backers sometimes are considered to be pass players before they are run players. But that depends on where they are lined up, if they are outside of the box of the defense then they will be pass first players, but if they play inside the box lined up behind the defensive end then they are typically a run player. One of the outside linebackers is usually called into either blitz or pass coverage to make up for the missing DB.

He stated that his commitment to Chile did not allow him to take an easy way out, and he would not be used as a propaganda tool by those he called \"traitors\" , clearly implying he intended to fight to the end. Shortly afterwards, the coup plotters announced that Allende had committed suicide. An official announcement declared that the weapon he had used was an automatic rifle. Before his death he had been photographed several times holding an AK-47, a gift from Fidel Castro. He was found dead with that gun, according to contemporaneous statements made by officials in the Pinochet regime. Lingering doubts regarding the manner of Allende's death persisted throughout the period of the Pinochet regime. Many Chileans and independent observers refused to accept on faith the government's version of events amid speculation that Allende had been murdered by government agents. When in 2011 a Chilean court opened a criminal investigation into the circumstances of Allende's death, Pinochet had long since left power. The ongoing criminal investigation led to a May 2011 court order that Allende's remains be exhumed and autopsied by an international team of experts. Results of the autopsy were officially released in mid-July 2011. The team of experts concluded that the former president had shot himself with an AK-47 assault rifle. In December 2011 the judge in charge of the investigation affirmed the experts' findings and ruled Allende's death a suicide. On 11 September 2012, the 39th anniversary of Allende's death, a Chilean appeals court unanimously upheld the trial court's ruling, officially closing the case. The Guardian reported that a scientific autopsy of the remains had confirmed that \"Salvador Allende committed suicide during the 1973 coup that toppled his socialist government.\" It went on to say that: According to Isabel Allende Bussi, the daughter of Salvador Allende and currently a member of the Chilean Senate, the Allende family has long accepted that the former president shot himself, telling the BBC that: \"The report conclusions are consistent with what we already believed. When faced with extreme circumstances, he made the decision of taking his own life, instead of being humiliated.\" The definitive and unanimous results produced by the 2011 Chilean judicial investigation appear to have laid to rest decades of nagging suspicions that Allende might have been assassinated by the Chilean Armed Forces. But public acceptance of the suicide theory had already been growing for much of the previous decade. In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began to tell their stories to the news media and to human rights researchers. The cumulative weight of the facts reported by those witnesses provided factual support for many previously-unconfirmed details relating to Allende's death.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other.

I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence.

Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\".

One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled. Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family.

It is also understood that Camille will follow Calvin and work in some type of medical field.  Her life is considered by her and people around her to be \"normal\" and what is expected. Then on her 21st birthday she is attended to at a gas station by Billy Ryan Gallo, a mechanic during the day who turns out to be a blues musician at night.  When Camille shows up at Thelma's Bar later that evening, Billy formally introduces himself and then serenades her from the stage, much to her surprise and the amusement of her roommates. Camille runs into Billy again when she is out with Calvin and Billy is playing at the restaurant/casino.  Impressed with Billy's style, Calvin asks if he can buy Billy a drink and Billy joins them at their table and does not let on that he already has met Camille.  After a short conversation, Billy invites both to Thelma's Bar the following evening but Calvin declines saying he will be out of town. The next day, Camille goes alone to Thelma's and watches again as Billy takes the stage and appears to be singing only to her.  When his set is complete, Billy asks if Camille will go out and about New Orleans, a town where Camille has lived for over ten years but has never experienced.  The night sees Camille and Billy visiting clubs, riding around, laughing and dancing and being very free and comfortable with each other.  They then go to a club where she is handed a mic and impromptuly sings with a powerful voice that has Billy awed. As the chemistry between the two heats up, Camille retreats back to her safe world and Billy, respecting her decision, says if they cannot be more than friends, then would she consider singing in his new band.  Camille agrees and two begin a musical friendship.  They decide to try their act out at Camille's college's open mic night, Billy playing guitar and Camille singing.

Overwhelmed by the pressure and her parents happiness, Camille agrees to marry Calvin and options out of her desired career choice.  She then meets with Billy and displays the engagement ring.  Furious with Camille for not standing up for what she wants and trying to make everyone happy but herself, Billy ends their friendship. Two weeks later at the engagement party, Camille's roommates observe Camille and find that their friend isn't herself and the whole event just \"doesn't feel right.\"  They take Camille aside and tell her that at any point she wants to leave, they will help drive her away. The party is an upscale social event attended by what Calvin calls \"very important people.\"  Camille decides to serenade Calvin with a love song and everyone in the audience is amazed by her talent except for Calvin and her father, who appear to be engrossed in their own conversation.  And while she sings, Camille's thoughts turn to Billy as she watches Calvin ignore her performance.  When the song ends she announces to everyone that she is not in love with Calvin but in love with a man who \"really sees her.\"  She calls off the engagement and drives away with her roommates. Camille goes back to her place, changes and drives to find Billy at the gas station.  He is standoffish towards her and asks her to leave but she stays to show him her bare ring finger.  Billy softens and understands the enormity of what Camille did and he again asks her if this is for real.  She smiles and says yes and the two kiss and hug and finally appear as a couple.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14. A scientific study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result violence and war.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who is best known for writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. \"I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [spin on the] spirit of '76. I came up \u2014 out of the blue one day \u2014 with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world,\" he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. \"I've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?\" he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies''' running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, \"It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [Laughs] They say write what you know, and with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories.\" While writing the pilot, Rodat dedicated a five-page montage to the alien invasion, but decided not to go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds. \"I wrote a few drafts of it and I looked at and say, 'Ay-yay-yay, I\u2019ve seen this before. There's no emotion to this. It feels like one of those montages,'\" he said. Rodat came up with the idea of having the children in the series \"harnessed by aliens\". \"When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [Spielberg] was the idea that adults are killed if they're a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we\u2019ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show but that also is something that's going to have to unveil itself gradually,\" he stated. Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Series lead Noah Wyle emphasized Spielberg's presence on set by stating \"Anytime he gives an anointment to a project, it steps up the pedigree.\" Colin Cunningham, who plays outlaw John Pope, exclaimed \"You'd show up and think, \u2018This is not a TV show; this is something else that we're doing,\u2019 \" he said, noting that Spielberg was very hands-on for the pilot. \"Its scope is massive. Anytime you hear the word Spielberg, you know it's not going to be crap; you know it\u2019ll be quality and there will be some money behind it.\" Mark Verheiden, who was the showrunner for the first season, stated \"It's great to know you have a world-class filmmaker backing up what you're trying to do who is supportive and helping design the great stuff.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Following the release of \"The Wind\", Guitierrez and Eubanks left the group, to be replaced by Nolan's brother Jimmy on tenor and George Scott on bass. Over the next two years this configuration of Diablos would turn out several records, including \"Route 16\", \"Do You Remember What You Did\", \"Daddy Rockin' Strong\", \"The Way You Dog Me Around\", \"You Are\", and \"A Teardrop From Heaven\". By late 1956, more changes occurred. Scott decided to leave the group about this time to join Hank Ballard & the Midnighters - and again the Diablos were in need of a bass. Jay Johnson, who was introduced to Strong through fellow Fortune artist Andre Williams. Although not quite 16 at the time, Jay Johnson was already a veteran singer, having sung bass with Williams' \"new\" group on \"Bacon Fat\", \"Just Because of a Kiss\", \"Mean Jean\", and \"Bobby Jean\". Strong was impressed and the Diablos had their new bassman. Jay Johnson's first session with the Diablos was on \"Can't We Talk It Over\" and \"Mambo of Love\", recorded in late 1956 and released in 1957. By the time the first Fortune of Hits album came out, Jay Johnson had already replaced Scott with the group. Unfortunately, the picture on the album cover did not reflect this change, and shows the group with Scott instead of Johnson. This oversight may be a factor in many believing that Jay Johnson did not join the group until several years later. In fact, Johnson is heard on bass on more Diablos recordings than either Eubanks or Scott. Among these are: \"Beside You\", \"Mind Over Matter\", \"Everything They Said Came True\", \"Welcome Baby to My Heart\", \"I Wanna Know\", \"If I Could Be With You\", \"Since You're Gone\", \"Harriet\", \"Harriette It's You\", \"I Am With You\", \"Are You Making a Fool Out of Me\", \"You're My Happiness\", \"Village of Love\", \"For Old Times Sake\", \"My Heart Will Always Belong to You\", and \"Come Home Little Girl\". On \"Village of Love\", Johnson also provided the bass on the original Fortune version by Nathaniel Mayer & the Fabulous Twilights. Also in late 1956, about the time Jay Johnson joined the group, Strong departed for a two-year stint in the army. While Nolan was in the service, the Diablos released one single without him, \"Harriet\", backed with \"Come Home Little Girl\", featuring Hunter on lead. Without Strong, the Diablos' magic seemed to be missing and the record received little fanfare. After Strong returned from the service, the group recorded \"Harriette It's You\", but there were many changes to come. Fortune was focusing more of their attention on Strong, and not the Diablos group. In 1954, records showed \"The Diablos Featuring Nolan Strong\". Then billing changed to \"Nolan Strong & the Diablos\", and by 1962, when \"Mind Over Matter\" was climbing the charts, the label just read \"Nolan Strong\", although the Diablos were on the record, as prominent as ever. This lack of recognition along with financial inequities , inevitably lead to the group's demise. Just as Strong had been influenced by Clyde McPhatter, he in turn would be influential to Smokey Robinson. And Robinson was not the only one at Motown to have an appreciation for Nolan Strong & the Diablos. Berry Gordy had wanted to bring the Diablos into his fast-growing Motown complex. The deal was never finalised. The group disbanded in 1964, with a few more record releases and reissues the following years. Jimmy Strong died on January 29, 1970, at age 34. Edwards died March 17, 2001 at age 63. Hunter and Eubanks are also deceased.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was \"the kind of character you rarely see anymore  he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it\". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \"a very tricky structure\" for a feature film. A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as \"an L.A.-set action mystery\", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board. By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project. Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: \"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me  writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \"very strong character\" at its core, and a \"powerful\" romance. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said: I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft  maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. The actor chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, whose work he admired. He said, \"It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.\" When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Roger Ebert reiterated Gene Siskel's earlier opinion, stating that the film was \"basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship.\" He described it as one of several science fiction pictures that were \"real disappointments\" compared to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, in both episodes Ebert singled out the early scene of the Nostromo crew exploring the alien planet for praise,  calling the scene \"inspired,\" said that it showed \"real imagination\" and claimed that it transcended the rest of the film. Over two decades later, Ebert had revised his opinion of the film, including it on his Great Movies list, where he gave it four stars and said \"Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original.\" In 1980, the film was included in Cinefantastiques list of the top films of the 1970s while failing to make the magazine's top ten. Frederick S. Clarke, the magazine's editor, wrote that Alien was \"an exercise in style, refreshingly adult in approach, wickedly grim and perverse, that manages to compensate for a lack of depth in both story and characters.\" In 1982, John Simon of the National Review praised the cast of Alien, particularly Sigourney Weaver, and the film's visual values. Simon also wrote, \"For fanciers of horror, among whose numbers I do not count myself, Alien is recommendable, provided they are free from hypocrisy and finicky stomachs\". Despite initial mixed reviews, Alien has received critical acclaim over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment, and is cited one of the best films of 1979.

Halliwell's Film Guide awarded it a full four stars, describing it as \"a classic of suspense and art direction\". Alan Jones of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five, describing it as a \"revolutionary 'haunted house in space' thrill-ride [...] stunning you with shock after shock\", praising the \"top-notch acting [...] and imaginative bio-mechanical production design\", as well as \"Ridley Scott's eye for detail and brilliant way of alternating false scares with genuine jolts, which help to create a seamless blend of gothic horror and harrowing science fiction\". Critical interest in the film was re-ignited with the theatrical release of the \"Director's Cut\" in 2003. Roger Ebert ranked it among \"the most influential of modern action pictures\" and praised its pacing, atmosphere, and settings: David McIntee praises Alien as \"possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings.\" He notes that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: \"It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal.\" Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th , he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: \"The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.\" He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: \"Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim.\" David Edelstein wrote, \"Alien remains the key text in the 'body horror' subgenre that flowered in the seventies, and Giger's designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.

With the combined influence of \"Cloud Piece\" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as \"a humanistic paean for the people\". Blaney wrote, \"Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential.\" Rolling Stones David Fricke commented: \"[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class.\" Lennon stated: \"'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\" He told NME: \"There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ...

The original piano musical motif was created in January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions. Lennon finished composing \"Imagine\" one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.

Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\" Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process. In 1982's American Skeptic: Robert Altman's Genre-Commentary Films by Norman Kagan, he cites the film as an \"anti-genre exploration of what might be called the theme of madness. This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1276", "question": "What genre is Push?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_69901", "text": "Early in his career, Penderecki was one of the key figures associated with the Polish avant-garde movement of the 1960s. Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis , Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima , and Fluorescences , were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters. By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character. Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\" The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Born in Covington, Tennessee, he released a record on Sun Records in 1954, just after Elvis Presley. Yelvington began performing in local venues at the age of 14, having learned to sing and play guitar as a boy. His voice was a baritone, somewhat comparable to Ernest Tubb . He continued with mostly local engagements into his 20s, and was passed over for military service in World War II because of his health. In the late 1940s, he began playing with Reece Fleming's band, The Tennesseans, at the Memphis Gem Theater. This group disbanded in 1952, and several of its members, including Yelvington, picked up with local troupe the Star Rhythm Boys. They performed daily on local radio and had a steady and popular gig at the Clover Club north of Covington, but family attachments prevented most of the players from traveling or touring with the group. Yelvington began playing side gigs in Memphis whenever he wasn't playing with the Star Rhythm Boys. Yelvington and guitarist Gordon Mashburn first heard word of Sam Phillips's Sun Records in 1953, and arranged a meeting. Philips was initially unimpressed with Yelvington and the Star Rhythm Boys, because he was not interested in recording straight-ahead country music; however, he thought the band had potential, and had them audition a large number of songs. The first cut he recorded with them was a blues number written by Stick McGhee called \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\". The result was a record with blues roots and a blues feel but a steel guitar that sounded unmistakably country. This recording was issued on Sun Records immediately after Elvis Presley's \"That's All Right Mama\". Phillips did not give Yelvington promotional backing, and so he and the band self-marketed the record to local stations, to little avail. The record was picked up neither by blues nor by country radio stations, each of which seemed to think it sounded too much like the other. \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was one out of only two records Yelvington cut for Sun. In 1955 he released a single, \"Yakety Yak\" , on competitor Meteor Records. The record was released under the name Mac Sales and the Esquire Trio so as to avoid legal action by Phillips, to whom he was still contractually obliged. In 1956, Yelvington recorded again with Sun, releasing the rockabilly track \"Rockin' With My Baby\". Yelvington, now in his late thirties, was not excited about the rockabilly sound, and by 1958 he and his band members parted ways. Yelvington struck out on his own as a solo artist, but had no luck and eventually quit music, concentrating on raising his family of five children. He was essentially forgotten until the 1980s, when popular music historians began digging into the Sun back catalogue; fans and concert promoters attempted to bring him out of retirement. His career saw a resurgence in Memphis as a rockabilly revivalist, and in 1997, he released his first full-length album at the age of 79. By the time of his death in 2001, in Memphis, he was regarded as an elder statesman of country music and rockabilly. A live show in the Netherlands during his first European tour in 1988 was taped and released on Collector Records in 1991. In 2006, Bear Family Records reissued his Sun Records recordings on compact disc. On February 22, 2018, the song \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" b/w \"Just Rolling Along\" by Malcolm Yelvington and the Star Rhythm Boys was accepted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation.

{"id": "91_1298", "question": "What genre is Analyze This?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_12610", "text": "The central theme of The Thing concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions. Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diaboliques Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that MacReady destroys the chess computer after being checkmated, and similarly vows to destroy the Thing, even at the expense of the team. The Cold War-style isolationism hurts the group, while a lack of trust destroys it. Screen Rants Michael Edward Taylor draws allusions between The Thing and the accusatory Red Scares and McCarthyism, as the film conveys an anti-communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation. Slant Magazines John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War \"fatigued counterculturalism\"\u2014the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities. Lancaster's script eschews female characters because he believed that a female character would be a love interest who inevitably gets in the way. The Atlantics Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, females are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. Indeed, several assimilations involve penetration, tentacles, and in Norris's case, opened up at the stomach to birth his own replica. The slasher genre favors female stars as they are perceived as weaker and therefore more empathetic, providing a cathartic release when they defeat the villain, but in The Thing the men are not meant to survive. Vices Patrick Marlborough considered The Thing to be a critical take on masculinity. Identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but masculinity prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other. Nerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizonss Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror, the notion that ancient, inhuman beings exist that do not care about humanity in any way. This also includes the fear of losing one's humanity, and being consumed, figuratively or literally, by these ancient eldritch behemoths. The Thing is a being beyond our understanding and possesses the ability to destroy all life on Earth quickly. Just as Lovecraft left his creatures undescribed, the Thing can be seen, but its shape is mostly indescribable, beyond the realm of human knowledge. Grey said that MacReady represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist, but Blair represents the Lovecraftian protagonist, who succumbs to his fear of the creature, is driven insane by the implications of its nature, and eventually becomes what he fears. The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self. It attacks, consumes and imitates an individual perfectly with memories and behaviors. The original is subsumed by an alien copy that is virtually impossible to identify. Den of Geeks Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\" Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could only be identified by a blood test. Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming. During production, Carpenter considered having MacReady be infected, and an alternate ending showed MacReady having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected. Russell has said that analyzing the scene for clues is \"missing the point\". He continued, \"[Carpenter] and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn't know anything... They didn't know if they knew who they were... I love that, over the years, that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past the horrificness of the monster... to see what the movie was about, which was paranoia.\" However, Carpenter has teased, \"Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream.

South Korean singer Luna's song \"Madonna\" referenced \"Vogue\" on its lyrics, \"When I grow up, I wanna be like Madonna / When I grow up, I wanna vogue how I wanna\". The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death.

{"id": "91_1306", "question": "What genre is Phantom of the Opera?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24563", "text": "As the \"first true megamusical\", Cats pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals\u00a0\u2014 including Les Mis\u00e9rables , The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon \u2014 that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained: Cats introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting\u00a0\u2014 and then aggressively promoting\u00a0\u2014 a single recognisable image as the face of the show. The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline to create what The Daily Telegraph called \"one of musical theatre's greatest posters\". Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for Les Mis\u00e9rables and the Phantom's mask for The Phantom of the Opera. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called \"critic-proof\" status of megamusicals. Additionally, Cats was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official Cats t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry. Beyond the megamusical, Cats also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: \"Cats is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped. People do want a theatrical experience for their children.\" Thanks to its easily accessible spectacle, the original Broadway production also tapped into the then-burgeoning tourist boom in New York and its audience shifted increasingly towards foreign visitors in its later years. Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to Cats, citing the latter's disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience. The musical's fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey's pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an \"architectural manner\", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of Cats was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre. Cats opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote: In the 1980s, the success of local productions of Cats in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit. The musical was also a boon for the Broadway touring industry. In 1997, The New York Times credited the regional and touring productions of Cats with \"almost single-handedly reviv[ing] the sagging road business\". Cats revolutionised the touring business by introducing the now commonplace practice of extended touring engagements that can last several weeks or months in a single city, as opposed to the typical one-week or ten-day tour stop. Mackintosh's insistence that all touring productions of Cats replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical's demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This defensive scheme is often played with two inside line backers and two outside line backers. The names of the two inside line backers are often called Sam and Mike and these two are lined up about four yards from the line of scrimmage and are lined up with the offensive guard. The inside line backers are often more of a run player so they will defend the run before they will the pass. These line backers will be reading the offensive guard so they know what to do, so if the guard sets up to pass block the line backers know to get into their zone in order to cover the pass. If the guard come out for a run play they know that they need to fill the gap that they are supposed to so that they can make a play if it comes to them. Also, these inside line backers are often called on a blitz which is when no matter what the offense does, as soon as that ball is snapped they are shooting their gap and trying to get into the back field to make a play as fast as possible. Outside line backers sometimes are considered to be pass players before they are run players. But that depends on where they are lined up, if they are outside of the box of the defense then they will be pass first players, but if they play inside the box lined up behind the defensive end then they are typically a run player. One of the outside linebackers is usually called into either blitz or pass coverage to make up for the missing DB.

Sarah and Rachel fall asleep in a dog house at a farm where they are discovered by the farmers, Jules and Genevieve Dufaure. Despite knowing what they are and the associated danger, the Dufaures decide to help the girls. Rachel is dying, and when they call attention to themselves by calling in a doctor, a skeptical German officer asks them if they know anything about a second Jewish child.

Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis , Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima , and Fluorescences , were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters. By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character. Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\" The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Still, the actress Jaya Bachchan criticized his work from Devdas and encouraged him to \"attempt something different\"; in later years, he would say that it motivated him to make Black. Bhansali chose to address a subject that no other directors had done before: \"I didn't want to stop making a film straight from my heart because of the fear of losing my audiences.\" He described it as \"a step towards a more complex kind of film than what we get in mainstream cinema\", adding, \"It is an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit.\" He announced the film in July 2003, along with his other project, Bajirao Mastani, which would be released in 2015. The media declared it as his \"most personal film\". Bhansali revealed that he was inspired by American activist Helen Keller's life story. However, he stated that he only used it as a reference and the film was \"a completely original piece of work\". Additionally, Bhansali also read Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life and other related books, including Geraldine Lawhorn's On the Crossroads . In an interview with The Hindu, he said, \"I was fascinated by the ways in which teachers and parents struggled to reach out to the hearing-impaired children. How do you start the communication? How do you keep it going? What takes other children a year to learn takes 10 years for them to absorb.\" In addition, some sources claimed that it served as a remake for Arthur Penn's The Miracle Worker , but Bhansali denied the reports. Others claimed that the film was based on Prakash Kapadia's Gujarati play Aatam Vinjhe Paankh, which was inspired by The Miracle Worker. Bhansali chose the word black for the film's title; according to him, black is his favorite color and he felt it has a \"universal resonance\". He explained how the color's monotones and shades were \"very attractive if used intelligently\", and it was \"the best element ... that ... doesn't overshadow the characters or narrative\". He added that it was \"a powerful striking colour which describes the film's sensitivities\", and defined his mood and temperament. \"I wear black clothes most of the time. The colour calms me. When I decided to make a film about the world of the sightless, Black was the title that came to mind immediately\", he said when interviewed by Sify. The same title had been registered by the actor Kumar Gaurav before, and Bhansali asked him to relinquish and gave the title for his next project. According to an article published by Screen in November 2005, Gaurav saw that the film was \"bold and path-breaking\"; consequently, he finally gave up the title. As gratitude, Bhansali credited Gaurav's name in the opening credits of Black. Bhansali told The Telegraph that Keller's life was an \"exemplary to all of us\", believing that he had \"personally learned so much from her\"; he stated that he learned \"the value of a teacher in any student's life\". Journalists asserted that his involvement in both Black and Bajirao Mastani proved his ability in two opposite film genres; he expressed: \"It is a conscious process of rejuvenation as a filmmaker. I have to reinvent myself as a creative person.\" He then described the former film as \"an uplifting tale on the triumph of the human spirit\", and it was \"about feeling, not speaking\".

It has soul, that's why \u2013 it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero but as long as he's Roger's that doesn't matter.\" Wish You Were Here has since been frequently regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time.

{"id": "91_1321", "question": "What genre is Brad Delp?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_41377", "text": "Sometime between 11:00\u00a0pm on March 8 and 1:20\u00a0pm on March 9, 2007, Delp committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his home on 55 Academy Avenue, in Atkinson, New Hampshire. He left various notes scattered from his car to the interior of his home. The Atkinson police discovered his body on the floor of his master bathroom after his fianc\u00e9e, Pamela Sullivan saw a dryer vent tube connected to the exhaust pipe of Delp's car. Two charcoal grills were found to have been placed in the bathtub and lit, causing the room to fill with smoke. A suicide note was paper-clipped to the neck of his T-shirt, which read the same as a character's note from Twin Peaks: \"Mr. Brad Delp. 'J'ai une \u00e2me solitaire'. I am a lonely soul.\" Delp left four sealed envelopes in his office addressed to his children, his former wife Micki, his fianc\u00e9e, and a couple who were not named by the media. He was 55 years old. The following day, Boston's website was temporarily closed down, the webmaster having replaced their homepage with a simple black background and white text message: \"We've just lost the nicest guy in rock and roll.\" Delp's cause of death was ruled a suicide. The reason for Delp's suicide has been the subject of contradictory news reports and various lawsuits. A series of interviews conducted by the Boston Herald alleged that lingering hard feelings from Boston's disbandment in the 1980s and personal tension between Delp and bandleader Scholz drove the singer to commit suicide. Scholz denied these claims but lost the defamation suits he filed in response. Court documents from the trials detail Scholz stating that Delp was plagued by personal problems. Boston Herald attorneys pointed to testimony from former Boston members, other local musicians, Delp's doctor, and Delp's friends, including Meg Sullivan , many of whom say the singer disliked Scholz, desperately wanted to quit the band, and felt tormented by his role as middleman in an ugly conflict between Scholz and former band members. All of this was summarized in a 140-page statement filed by the Herald in April 2012. Additional sworn testimony by Meg Sullivan revealed an additional explanation for Delp\u2019s suicide: Delp was housemates with Meg, fianc\u00e9e Pamela's sister, for two and a half years before his death. On February 28, 2007, Meg discovered a hidden camera planted in her room. After Meg confronted him, Delp admitted to planting the camera and later wrote a series of emails pleading for forgiveness. Todd Winmill, Meg's boyfriend, implored Delp to admit his wrongdoings to Pamela on March 3. After promising to tell her in a few days, Delp purchased the grills and tubing he later used to commit suicide. Pamela found his body on March 9 in the room where several notes were written by Delp, one of which read: \"I have had bouts of depression and thoughts of suicide since I was a teenager \u2026 [Pamela] was my 'ray of sunshine', but sometimes even a ray of sunshine is no substitute for a good psychiatrist.\" On October 16, 2007, Barry Goudreau released one final song with Delp on vocals, titled \"Rockin Away\". Written and recorded in the summer of 2006, co-written with Goudreau, it is an autobiography of Delp's musical career. According to \"America's Music Charts\", the song reached #20 on the rock charts in January 2008. On what would have been Delp's 61st birthday, June 12, 2012, Jenna Delp, Delp's daughter and president of the Brad Delp Foundation, released an MP3 on the foundation website of a \"never before released\" song which was written and recorded by Delp in 1973. It also was announced the foundation intended to release a complete album of Delp's solo work at some point in the future, which would encompass a span of 30 years of previously unreleased material written and recorded by Delp and his closest friends. On November 25, 2015, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found in favor of the Boston Herald and Micki Delp in a defamation lawsuit brought by Scholz. In its ruling, the court said that statements attributing Delp's suicide to Scholz were \"statements of opinion and not verifiable fact and therefore could not form the basis of a claim of defamation.\" On February 23, 2016, Scholz filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court of the United States to allow his defamation lawsuit to proceed. On June 6, 2016, the Supreme Court declined to review the case.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In this system a piece of music progresses from one chord to the next according to certain rules, each chord being characterised by four notes. The principles of four-part harmony are found not only in Bach's four-part choral music: he also prescribes it for instance for the figured bass accompaniment. The new system was at the core of Bach's style, and his compositions are to a large extent considered as laying down the rules for the evolving scheme that would dominate musical expression in the next centuries. Some examples of this characteristic of Bach's style and its influence: When in the 1740s Bach staged his arrangement of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater, he upgraded the viola part to fill out the harmony, thus adapting the composition to his four-part harmony style. When, starting in the 19th century in Russia, there was a discussion about the authenticity of four-part court chant settings compared to earlier Russian traditions, Bach's four-part chorale settings, such as those ending his Chorale cantatas, were considered as foreign-influenced models. Such influence was deemed unavoidable, however. Bach's insistence on the tonal system and contribution to shaping it did not imply he was less at ease with the older modal system and the genres associated with it: more than his contemporaries , Bach often returned to the then-antiquated modi and genres. His Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, emulating the chromatic fantasia genre as used by earlier composers such as Dowland and Sweelinck in D dorian mode , is an example of this.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Meanwhile, local contractor Matthew Lane picks up his 9-year-old daughter, Cassandra, after her figure skating practice. Matthew stops to pick up pie, leaving Cassandra in his truck. Minutes later, he returns to find her missing. He reports the abduction to the police station, where Jeffrey and Nicole are assigned to the case. They are skeptical of his story, which infuriates him. Cassandra's mother, Tina Lane, arrives and breaks down in rage at Matthew. Eight years later, Matthew and Tina are estranged; she blames him for Cassandra's disappearance. Nicole and Jeffrey are now romantically involved. Tina meets with the police regularly to discuss their case but Matthew, originally a suspect, has become a vigilante in the search for Cassandra. This entire time Cassandra has been held captive in the home of a child pornographer named Mika, who has installed remote cameras in the hotel rooms where Tina works as a chambermaid. Although Mika leaves his house to work and is no longer sexually interested in the now-teenaged Cassandra, the fear that he will harm her parents keeps Cassandra from escaping or seeking help. Jeffrey finds recent photos of Cassandra online. Mika makes her tell stories on camera to lure in younger children. Nicole poses as a child, which allows her and Jeffrey to catch a child molester named Willy, as well as a group of others. The arrests put Nicole into the public eye. Mika visits Willy in prison and urges him not to take any deals for cooperation. Willy says he will only comply if someone kidnaps Nicole and forces her to reveal what in her past may have inspired her to pursue child protection. Cassandra begins chatting online with a young girl, trying to entice her to meet. When Nicole arrives home, she finds Jeffrey using his own niece as bait to infiltrate the child porn community and immediately shuts off the web cam. Mika secretly turns the webcam back on to watch their fight and reconsiders Willy's offer regarding Nicole. Nicole attends a dinner held in her honor where she is drugged and kidnapped by Vicky, a woman working for Mika. While transporting trees in his truck, Matthew stays overnight at a motel.  He wakes to find the trees have been taken and left in a trail that ultimately leads him to a remote location where he finds Cassandra. Cassandra resists leaving with him and Matthew does not understand why until Mika appears and tranquilizes him; Mika had arranged the meeting to watch their reunion. Mika locks Nicole in a van and tells her to tell her story into a microphone. At the ice skating rink, Vicky questions Cassandra's former skating partner, Albert, about their history, pressuring him for details on how he was impacted by the disappearance. Matthew overhears this and follows Vicky to a restaurant, where he eavesdrops as Vicky plays a recording of her conversation with Albert for Mika. Matthew calls Jeffrey with their location and plants his phone's GPS on Mika's vehicle. Matthew goads the diner staff to call the police by being disruptive. He confronts the abductors to buy more time and steals Vicky's cell phone. She and Mika chase Matthew in their vehicle, shooting at his truck. Matthew escapes by driving by the diner again, where multiple police cars have responded to the staff's earlier calls. Jeffrey tracks Matthew's phone and locates Mika's house.

Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey. Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near G\u00e4vle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland. Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Ume\u00e5, Lule\u00e5 and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over  expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book . However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system. In  Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora. The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with  as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described  as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus's works. It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\" In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna.

His father Domenico and his brothers Niccol\u00f2 and Gian Antonio were also painters, later inheriting the family workshop after the father's death in 1716. They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to Francesco. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. In 1735, Guardi moved to the workshop of Michele Marieschi, where he remained until 1743. His first certain works are from 1738, for a parish at Vigo d'Anuania, in Trentino. In this period he worked alongside his older brother, Gian Antonio. The first work signed by Francesco is a Saint Adoring the Eucharist . His works in this period included both landscapes and figure compositions. His early vedutas show influence both from Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. On 15 February 1757, he married Maria Mattea Pagani, the daughter of painter Matteo Pagani. In 1760 his brother Gian Antonio died and his first son, Vincenzo, was born. His second son, Giacomo, was born in 1764. In 1763 he worked in Murano, in the church of San Pietro Martire, finishing a Miracle of a Dominican Saint clearly influenced by Alessandro Magnasco in its quasi-expressionistic style. Francesco Guardi's most important later works include the Doge's Feasts, a series of twelve canvases celebrating the ceremonies held in 1763 for the election of Doge Alvise IV Mocenigo. In his later years, Canaletto's influence on his art diminished, as shown by the Piazzetta in the Ca' d'Oro of Venice. In circa 1778, he painted the severe Holy Trinity Appearing to Sts. Peter and Paul in the parish church of Roncegno. In 1782 Guardi was commissioned by the Venetian government six canvases to celebrate the visit of the Russian Archdukes in the city, of which only two remain, and two others for that of Pope Pius VI. On September 12 of that year he was admitted to the Fine Art Academy of Venice. A stronger attention to colours is present in late works such as the Concerto of 80 Orphans of 1782, now in Munich, in the Fa\u00e7ade of Palace with Staircase in the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo.

Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film \"adroitly and tenderly observed\", \"smartly handled\", and \"most notable for the surprising and entirely winning performance by Sean Penn.\" He added, \"while Milk is unquestionably marked by many mandatory scenes . . . the quality of the writing, acting and directing generally invests them with the feel of real life and credible personal interchange, rather than of scripted stops along the way from aspiration to triumph to tragedy.

It stated that \"Milk achieves what it sets out to do, telling an inspiring tale of one man's quest to legitimize his identity, to give hope to his community. I'm not sure how well it'll play outside of big cities, or if it will sway any opinions on hot-button political issues, but it gives a valiant, empathetic go of it.\" It also stated that the portrayal of Dan White was very fair and humanized and portrayed as more of a tragically flawed character, rather than a \"typical 'crazy Christian villain' stereotype\". In contrast, John Podhoretz of the conservative magazine Weekly Standard blasted the portrayal of Harvey Milk, saying that it treated the \"smart, aggressive, purposefully offensive, press-savvy\" activist like a \"teddy bear\". Podhoretz also argued that the film glosses over Milk's polyamorous relationships; he opined that this contrasts Milk with present-day gay rights activists fighting over monogamous same-sex marriage. Podhoretz mentioned as well that the film concentrates on Milk's opposition to the Briggs Initiative while ignoring that both Governor Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter had made more public statements against it. Screenwriter and journalist Richard David Boyle, who described himself as a former political ally of Milk's, stated that the film made a creditable effort at recreating the era. He also wrote that Penn captured Milk's \"smile and humanity\", and his sense of humor about his homosexuality. Boyle reserved criticism for what he felt was the film's inability to tell the whole story of Milk's election and demise. Luke Davies of The Monthly applauded the film for recreating \"the atmosphere, the sense of hope and battle; even the sound design, bustling with street noise, adds much vibrancy to the tale\", but voiced criticisms in regard to the message of the film, stating \"while the film is a political narrative in a grand historical sense, the murder of Milk is neither a political assassination nor an act of homophobic rage. Rather, it is an act of revenge for perceived wrongs and public humiliation,\" Davies continues to postulate that \"It seems as likely that Milk would have been murdered were he heterosexual. So the film can't be the heroic tale of a political martyr it needs to be in order to hold us and take our breath away. It's a simpler story, about a man who fought an extraordinary political fight and who was killed, arbitrarily and unnecessarily.\" Although Davies found Penn's portrayal of Milk moving, he adds that \"on a minor but troubling note, there are times when Penn's version of 'gay' acting veers dangerously close to a twee version of his childlike acting in I Am Sam.\" All his criticisms aside, Davies concludes that \"the heart of the film\u00a0\u2013 and while it is not perfect, it is uplifting\u00a0\u2013 lies in Penn's portrayal of Milk's generosity of spirit. The Advocate, while supporting the film in general, criticized the choice of Penn given the actor's support for the Cuban government despite the country's anti-gay rights record. Human Rights Foundation president Thor Halvorssen said in the article \"that Sean Penn would be honored by anyone, let alone the gay community, for having stood by a dictator that put gays into concentration camps is mind-boggling.\" Los Angeles Times film critic Patrick Goldstein commented in response to the controversy, \"I'm not holding my breath that anyone will be holding Penn's feet to the fire.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly: NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two\u00a0hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the series's cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2\u00a0million for 30\u00a0seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the Seinfeld finale at $1.7\u00a0million. In the U.S., 52.5\u00a0million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998. Although not the most-watched episode of the series, the finale was the fourth\u00a0most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of M*A*S*H, Cheers and Seinfeld, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4 and 76.2\u00a0million viewers.

Brown delineates the issue along cultural as well as formal lines. Russian symphonies are not German symphonies, he maintains, and the fact they may function along different parameters than their German counterparts does not make them any less valid on a musical or experiential level. Critics and musicologists agree universally that Tchaikovsky was not able to manipulate sonata form along the lines of a Mozart or Beethoven. This was a fact the composer himself bemoaned on more than one occasion. Though he received a Western European\u2013style musical education, he still faced a native set of musical rules and traditions that did not conform at all to Western ones. Rather than ignore his native music and look Westward as his teacher Anton Rubinstein had done or forgo the West as much as possible as The Five did, he chose to face the problem from both sides head\u2013on. The truth is, Wood writes, despite the composer's occasional self-indictments, Tchaikovsky did master \"form\" as he actually understood and could manage it from a compositional level. Warrack calls Tchaikovsky's solution to large-scale composition \"a compromise with sonata form.\" Wood maintains that what the composer called his \"mountains of padding\" were simply inseparable from his initial conceptions\u2014from his process of starting with an extra-musical program and from there deducing musical motives of widely divergent moods and character to be somehow worked into one movement. The alternative method was allowing his second theme to arise after and at the same time from the first, may have never occurred to him. However, it may have been equally likely that Tchaikovsky's compositional method never occurred to Mozart. While Tchaikovsky may have been incapable of writing absolute music, his real challenge was that while he was conscious of his formal shortcomings and continued striving for an unreached perfection, his actual ideal never really changed. Because the ideal never changed, the problems to which Tchaikovsky addressed himself never really changed, either. In this sense, it could be argued that he never really grew or matured. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky discovered a method by which to circumvent what he perceived as formal shortcomings and put his emotional life to work in large-scale abstract structures.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1339", "question": "What genre is Fear?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_12610", "text": "The central theme of The Thing concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions. Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diaboliques Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that MacReady destroys the chess computer after being checkmated, and similarly vows to destroy the Thing, even at the expense of the team. The Cold War-style isolationism hurts the group, while a lack of trust destroys it. Screen Rants Michael Edward Taylor draws allusions between The Thing and the accusatory Red Scares and McCarthyism, as the film conveys an anti-communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation. Slant Magazines John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War \"fatigued counterculturalism\"\u2014the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities. Lancaster's script eschews female characters because he believed that a female character would be a love interest who inevitably gets in the way. The Atlantics Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, females are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. Indeed, several assimilations involve penetration, tentacles, and in Norris's case, opened up at the stomach to birth his own replica. The slasher genre favors female stars as they are perceived as weaker and therefore more empathetic, providing a cathartic release when they defeat the villain, but in The Thing the men are not meant to survive. Vices Patrick Marlborough considered The Thing to be a critical take on masculinity. Identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but masculinity prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other. Nerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizonss Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror, the notion that ancient, inhuman beings exist that do not care about humanity in any way. This also includes the fear of losing one's humanity, and being consumed, figuratively or literally, by these ancient eldritch behemoths. The Thing is a being beyond our understanding and possesses the ability to destroy all life on Earth quickly. Just as Lovecraft left his creatures undescribed, the Thing can be seen, but its shape is mostly indescribable, beyond the realm of human knowledge. Grey said that MacReady represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist, but Blair represents the Lovecraftian protagonist, who succumbs to his fear of the creature, is driven insane by the implications of its nature, and eventually becomes what he fears. The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self. It attacks, consumes and imitates an individual perfectly with memories and behaviors. The original is subsumed by an alien copy that is virtually impossible to identify. Den of Geeks Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\" Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could only be identified by a blood test. Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming. During production, Carpenter considered having MacReady be infected, and an alternate ending showed MacReady having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected. Russell has said that analyzing the scene for clues is \"missing the point\". He continued, \"[Carpenter] and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn't know anything... They didn't know if they knew who they were... I love that, over the years, that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past the horrificness of the monster... to see what the movie was about, which was paranoia.\" However, Carpenter has teased, \"Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson, Bobby Rogers, and Pete Moore, this song was a Billboard Top 40 Pop hit, peaking at number 35, and a Top 10 Billboard R&B hit, peaking at number nine. A showcase for poetic wordplay, the Miracles utilized several famous nursery rhymes in this song; in fact, the song's title itself is a variation of the rhyme \"What Are Little Girls/Little Boys Made Of?\" and parts of this famous rhyme were incorporated into the lyrics of this song, which, like many Miracles songs, starts with the guitar licks of Miracles member Marv Tarplin. Robinson, as the lead singer, serves as the song's narrator: While Tarplin plays and Robinson sings the lyrics, the other Miracles (Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, Pete Moore and Claudette Robinson, answer in classic call-and-response style.

Although present on the original recording, Claudette Robinson, who was married to Smokey Robinson, was not present at the concert.

This Miracles song also inspired a cover version by Len Barry. The song's flip side was the popular regional Miracles hit tune, \"Would I Love You\", which was included on Greatest Hits from the Beginning, but did not appear on CD until 1996's Early Classics.

They all showed a defect of arms and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great. How Much Fortune Can Do In Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed As pointed out by  it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As  points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.

Fellow critic James Russell Lowell called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting\u2014rhetorically\u2014that he occasionally used prussic acid instead of ink. Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\". A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized. Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\". Poe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work in Continental Europe. Poe's early detective fiction tales featuring C. Auguste Dupin laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\" The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"Edgars\". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H.\u00a0G. Wells noted, \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". In 2013, The Guardian cited Pym as one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Doyle, Henry James, B. Traven, and David Morrell. Horror author and historian H. P. Lovecraft was heavily influenced by Poe's horror tales, dedicating an entire section of his long essay, \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\", to his influence on the genre. In his letters, Lovecraft stated, \"When I write stories, Edgar Allan Poe is my model.\" Alfred Hitchcock once said, \"It's because I liked Edgar Allan Poe's stories so much that I began to make suspense films\". Like many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators. One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by clairvoyants or psychics to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published Poems from the Inner Life in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"The Bells\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook. Even so, Poe has also received criticism. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation. William Butler Yeats was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\". Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\", and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\". Aldous Huxley wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"\u2014the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger. It is believed that only twelve copies have survived of Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems. In December 2009, one copy sold at Christie's auctioneers in New York City for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream.

South Korean singer Luna's song \"Madonna\" referenced \"Vogue\" on its lyrics, \"When I grow up, I wanna be like Madonna / When I grow up, I wanna vogue how I wanna\". The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death.

Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed.

However, Kon's name had become known among the film industry by the time of the Paprika project, and his reputation had already been established, so the film was produced. After finishing his first film, Perfect Blue, Kon was actually planning to make his next film, Paprika, with the producer of the company that financed it, but the project was ruined when the company, Rex Entertainment, went bankrupt. However, the idea of Paprika was in Kon's mind as early as 1998, and his attempts to depict the ambiguities and shaky boundaries between \"illusion and reality\" and \"memory and reality\" in his directorial debut Perfect Blue and his original film Millennium Actress were actually because he wanted to put into practice something like the novel Paprika in a visual way. The reason why he wanted to portray the ambiguity and boundary wavering between \"memory and reality\" was because he wanted to put into practice what I had done in the novel Paprika. Later, when he met with the author, Yasutaka Tsutsui, and received his permission to make the film, Kon said that he felt as if he had realized what he had always imagined. Unlike Perfect Blue, which was also based on a novel, Kon didn't change the fundamental parts of the original in Paprika, but he did change some parts of the novel to fit the movie. For two reasons, Kon thought that the original could not be adopted into a movie. One reason is that the novel Paprika is too voluminous to fit into a single film, and the other reason is that more than ten years have already passed since the novel was published, and many creators have already embodied the ideas inspired by Paprika in various media, not just in films. Therefore, Kon decided to first make the original into a simple form, and then incorporate ideas from the original as well as from Tsutsui's other works into the frame. Kon believed that the charm of the original lay in the dream scenes, and that the film would only be complete if the dream world was portrayed in rich detail with expressions that only visual images could provide. The descriptions of dreams in the novel are wonderful, but they are made possible by supplementary explanations in the text. However, in the case of visual works, which show the images of dreams flowing one after another, explanation is nothing but stopping the flow. In order to create a glamorous image for the entire film and still devote enough time to portraying the dream scenes without introducing the characters, Kon, in contrast to the previous film, used voice actors who were well known for their voice acting and fit the characters' image perfectly. The budget was about 300 million yen, and the production took about two and a half years from planning to completion.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film stars Joel McCrea and Betty Field, and features Harry Carey, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn and Porter Hall. The movie was filmed in 1942 but not released for over two years, and the released version differed from what Preston Sturges had wished, although he publicly accepted the film as his own. Paramount Pictures disliked the film Sturges had made, and pulled it from his control, re-titled and re-edited it, in the process making it more confusing for the audience to understand. The studio's released version was marketed in a way that made it appear to be one of Sturges' comedies. The film was not well received by the critics or the public, and marked the end of a sustained run of success for Sturges, who had already left Paramount by the time the film was released. Although rarely seen today, the film is notable for its flashback structure \u2013 comparable in some ways to Citizen Kane, which was influenced by the earlier film The Power and the Glory , for which Sturges wrote the screenplay \u2013 and for its irreverent and subtly satirical tone, unusual for a time when most Hollywood biopics were over-inflated and sentimental.

This defensive scheme is often played with two inside line backers and two outside line backers. The names of the two inside line backers are often called Sam and Mike and these two are lined up about four yards from the line of scrimmage and are lined up with the offensive guard. The inside line backers are often more of a run player so they will defend the run before they will the pass. These line backers will be reading the offensive guard so they know what to do, so if the guard sets up to pass block the line backers know to get into their zone in order to cover the pass. If the guard come out for a run play they know that they need to fill the gap that they are supposed to so that they can make a play if it comes to them. Also, these inside line backers are often called on a blitz which is when no matter what the offense does, as soon as that ball is snapped they are shooting their gap and trying to get into the back field to make a play as fast as possible. Outside line backers sometimes are considered to be pass players before they are run players. But that depends on where they are lined up, if they are outside of the box of the defense then they will be pass first players, but if they play inside the box lined up behind the defensive end then they are typically a run player.

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.

Lobell explained that he went to Bergman with the story idea, which then led to Bergman penning the script. Bergman, for his part, told William Wolf, of New York, that after being taken on a tour of the Garment District, he was taken by the chaotic nature of the environment, and imagined how a college professor like himself would have managed if forced into such hectic surroundings, and the plot developed from the juxtaposition of a crazed world with an ordered personality. So Fine also received positive pre-release attention due to the main plot device, the see-through buttocks of the jeans . Costume designer Santo Loquasto said he'd intentionally constructed the design as a sendup of those coming out of \u201cFashion Avenue,\u201d the stretch of Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, which runs through the traditional Garment District. In one scene, an elaborate commercial for the jeans, choreographed by Grover Dale, plays out. Loquasto had designed a custom set, wildly illuminated and featuring dozens of models in the see-through jeans, arching towards the camera. Loquasto amusedly observed that despite he and the filmmakers intentionally aiming to be outrageous, he was amazed to regularly return from the set and find television commercials he felt were even more so. Wolf reporting in a piece published several months before So Fine\u2019s release, visited the Filmways Studio and found the pairing of Richard Kiel and Mariangela Melato entertaining in a scene he viewed. Wolf's article highly praised Bergman, considering him one of the few positive contributors to the comedy genre in film. Bergman's previous writing credits were for Blazing Saddles and The In-Laws, neither of which Bergman had felt positively about, yet both of which were commercial and critical successes. In a New York interview, Bergman said that after his experiences with Blazing Saddles and The In-Laws, he was sure that So Fine was going to be a big hit, so he decided that he would direct the film, in order to be certain that what he thought of as a surefire screenplay would transition to the big screen with his vision intact. Pre-screenings were positive, but two weeks after the film's release , Bergman was disappointed to see the film gone from the theaters.

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds .  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format. The influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time. The traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings. While his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer. Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should. Mark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks. Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little\". King never hid his rejection of the final result of the film project, and accused Kubrick of not understanding the rules of the horror genre. King was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired the story . However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled The Shining, filmed at The Stanley Hotel. The animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the Bravo channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\". Nonetheless, writing in the afterword of Doctor Sleep, King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it \"...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember\u00a0\u2013 for reasons I have never quite understood\u00a0\u2013 as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.\" Mike Flanagan, director of the film adaptation of Doctor Sleep, would reconcile the differences between novel and film versions of The Shining there. Doctor Sleep is a direct adaptation of its novel counterpart, which itself is a sequel to the novel version of The Shining, but is also a continuation of Kubrick's film; in explaining the latter, Flanagan expressed, \"The Shining is so ubiquitous and has burned itself into the collective imagination of people who love cinema in a way that so few movies have. There\u2019s no other language to tell that story in. If you say \u2018Overlook Hotel,\u2019 I see something. It lives right up in my brain because of Stanley Kubrick. You can't pretend that isn't the case\". King initially rejected Flanagan's pitch of bringing back the Overlook as seen in Kubrick's film, but changed his mind after Flanagan pitched a scene within the hotel towards the end of the film that served as his reason to bring back the Overlook. Upon reading the script, King was so satisfied with the result that he said, \"Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version of The Shining is redeemed for me here.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The brothers spend their time playing games and stealing and devouring eggs from crows' nests. Their love for these eggs leads them to start calling themselves Periya Kaaka Muttai and \"Chinna Kaaka Muttai\" . The young boys constantly beg their mother and grandmother for toys they cannot afford, and later for a television. They don't yet understand that the two women can't give them everything they want. When their mother and grandmother finally do bring home a television\u00a0\u2013 a gift from the government to ration card holders who live below the poverty line\u00a0\u2013 it's like the opening of a portal. The boys see a pizza commercial on TV whose steaming, slow-motion images make the unfamiliar food look like manna from heaven. Meanwhile, a brand new pizzeria comes up in the neighbourhood, and actor Silambarasan alias Simbu comes to its opening. Remembering the looks of enjoyment on Simbu's face when he tasted a pizza at the pizzeria, the boys thereafter think of nothing else but getting their first taste of a pizza. The brothers go to the railway tracks each morning to collect the charcoal that falls off goods trains. They sell the charcoal at a scrap metal shop and are paid for their trouble. They usually hand the money over to their mother who is saving up to pay their lawyer to get her husband out of jail. But once the boys become aware of the cost of a pizza, they begin saving the money for themselves instead, lying to their mother that they have not collected any charcoal since they were out playing. The boys succeed in saving the \u20b9 300 required to buy a pizza, but are shooed away by the watchman of the pizza shop since they are badly dressed, which reflects the fact that they are local slum-dwellers. The boys narrate this story to their friend Pazharasam who works as a lineman with the Railways. He tells them that people place a lot of importance on clothes and advises them to save up and purchase new dresses before approaching the pizza outlet again. The boys go on to work again to save money for buying new clothes at Chennai Citi Centre. In the meantime, they show their grandmother the pamphlet from the pizza shop. She tries to make them a home-cooked pizza using dosa batter as base, but the boys deride her attempts and insult her. After finally saving up enough money for new dresses when the boys see Citi Centre, they realise that it is another big mall which would definitely not allow them inside. But they somehow manage to acquire a newly bought pair of clothes from a couple of rich children by buying them panipuri from a street vendor, much against the wishes of the rich boys' father, who had denied them the treat as he considered it unhygienic. The happy brothers return to the pizza shop in their new dresses. Another group of slum boys who are envious and sceptical about the brothers' story about going to eat pizza follows them to take a video of what transpires with the brothers at the pizza shop. The brothers are once again confronted by the watchman and he now forces them to go home right away but the boys protest by saying that they have money and are wearing new clothes. This argument attracts the attention of the pizzeria supervisor who comes out and slaps the older brother. This is caught on video by the other slum kids who laugh at the brothers' humiliation. The sad and disappointed brothers return to their slum only to be further overwhelmed by the miserable sight of their dead grandmother. The brothers feel guilty when they remember insulting their grandmother some time before. When two men in the slum happen to watch the video of the boy being slapped, they try to make money by threatening the owner of the pizza shop to release the video to the media. The owner realises he could be imprisoned and his pizzeria sealed by the government due to his supervisor's act of discrimination and violence against slum children. He offers one of the men a hundred thousand rupees for not making the video public. The man agrees, but his associate releases it to the media hoping to make some money . This stirs up tension amongst the pizzeria's owners who finally decide to publicly apologise to the slum kids. The boys are welcomed to the pizza spot in a red carpet reminiscent of Simbu being welcomed in the opening ceremony of the pizzeria. The owner also promises them free pizzas for life. Even as the brothers begin to finally enjoy their first pizza, they tell each other that the dosa-pizza which their grandmother had earlier made for them had tasted much better.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Humans have had limited success understanding the left-behind bits of Heechee technology found there and elsewhere. The Gateway Corporation administers the asteroid on behalf of the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the New People's Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United States of Brazil. There are nearly a thousand small, abandoned starships at Gateway. By extremely dangerous trial and error, humans have partially learned how to operate them. The controls for selecting a destination have been identified, but nobody knows where a particular setting will take the ship, how long the trip will last or even if there is enough fuel to get back. Those who choose to risk their lives cram the limited space with equipment and hopefully enough food for the trip, but sometimes it is not enough, and they have to resort first to cannibalism, and if that is not enough, to suicide. Attempts at reverse engineering to find out how the ships work have ended only in disaster, as has changing the settings in mid-flight. Most settings lead to useless or lethal places. A few, however, result in the discovery of new Heechee artifacts and habitable planets in other star systems, making the crews extremely wealthy. The vessels come in three standard sizes, which can hold a maximum of one, three, or five people. Some \"threes\" and many \"fives\" are armored. Each ship includes a lander to visit a planet or other object if one is found. Despite the risks, many people on impoverished, overcrowded Earth dream of going to Gateway. Robinette Stetley Broadhead is a young food shale miner who wins a lottery, giving him enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway. Once there, he is frightened of the danger and puts off going on a mission as long as he can. In the meantime, he becomes romantically involved with two different women, eventually settling on Gelle-Klara Moynlin, his co-enabler in fearful delaying. Eventually he starts running out of money, and although still terrified, he goes out on three trips. The first, with Klara and three others, is unsuccessful, and afterwards tension rises between them until he gives her a vicious beating. On the second trip, he goes by himself and inadvertently makes a discovery through unauthorized experimentation when he becomes infuriated after reaching Gateway Two, a smaller version of Gateway with only about 150 ships. He is awarded a sizable bonus because his route saves about 100 days of travel time; the windfall is partially offset by the large penalty for incapacitating his ship. On his third trip, the Gateway Corporation tries something different: sending two armored fives, one slightly behind the other, to the same destination, one rejected by most ships' computers; each crewmember is promised a million dollar bonus. Bob signs up in desperation, along with Klara, with whom he has reconciled. When the ships arrive, their crews find to their horror that they are in the gravitational grip of a black hole without enough power to break free. One person devises a desperate escape plan: Move everyone into one ship and thrust the other toward the black hole with an explosion in a lander, thus gaining enough of a boost to escape. They work frantically to transfer unnecessary equipment to make room for everyone in one ship, but Broadhead finds himself alone in the wrong ship when time runs out. He closes the hatch so that the plan can proceed. However, his ship is the one that breaks free. Broadhead returns to Gateway and is awarded all the mission bonuses. He feels such enormous survivor guilt for dooming his crewmates, especially Klara, that he suppresses his memories of what happened. However, he is very disturbed and miserable, though he does not understand why, so back on Earth as a wealthy man, he seeks therapy from an artificial intelligence Freudian therapist program which he names Sigfrid von Shrink. The narrative alternates in time between Broadhead's experiences on Gateway and his sessions with Sigfrid, converging on the traumatic events near the black hole and Broadhead finally remembering them so that he can begin to heal. Sigfrid helps him realize that, due to the gravitational time dilation of the black hole's immense gravity field, time is passing much more slowly for his former crewmates and none of them have actually died yet. Broadhead, however, concludes that this means that they will still be alive when he dies, with Klara still believing that he betrayed them to save himself. Also embedded in the narrative are various mission reports , roster openings, technical bulletins, and other documents Broadhead might have read on Gateway, adding to the verisimilitude.  The economic side of living at Gateway is presented in detail, commencing with the contract all explorers must enter into with the Gateway Corporation, and including how some awards are determined.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the years since its release, later reviews were more positive regarding the film. It later came to be considered, as Carpenter opined regarding his creation, \"a minor horror classic\" though he also stated it was not his favorite film due to re-shoots and low production values. This is one of the reasons he agreed to the 2005 remake. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 75% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.6/10 based on 67 reviews. The consensus reads, \"A well-crafted return to horror for genre giant John Carpenter, The Fog rolls in and wraps viewers in suitably slow-building chills.\" In his 1980 review, Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, commenting, \"This isn't a great movie but it does show great promise from Carpenter\". In a 2002 review , Slant Magazine reviewer Ed Gonzalez gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and stated that \"Carpenter's use of 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen is beyond legendary and his compositions evoke a town that may as well be the last remaining one on the face of the earth.\" Chris Justice at Classic-Horror.com commented \"The music is also classic Carpenter, and although the composer actually scrapped his original score and rewrote it to better match the film's vibe, viewers benefit greatly from his acute sense of rhythm, composition, and tone. His stark notes add another layer of complexity to a film that too often is forgotten. The editing is also brilliant; at 89 minutes, the film packs quite a punch and is worth every second.\" Zombiemania: 80 Movies to Die For author Arnold T. Blumberg wrote that the film was \"a very effective small scale chiller\" and \"an attempt to capture the essence of a typical spooky American folktale while simultaneously paying homage to the EC Comics of the 1950s and the then very recent Italian zombie influx.\" Slam Adams at House of Geekery commented \"The Fog is an incredibly atmospheric horror flick that takes the technical expertise of Halloween and adds more obvious supernatural elements. Carpenter picks and chooses what to show and what not to show, opting that more is less. It is impressive the way they seem to have complete control over the actual fog giving it an other-worldly, sentient feel.\" In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll of over 100 authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films.

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". \"Mothership\" essentially means \"Main series\", where as \"Escort\" essentially means \"Spinoff\". One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

She began writing in her early thirties while completing a dissertation in English literature about gay and lesbian fiction from the 1870s onward. Not enjoying expository writing, she attempted fiction and finding that she liked it, followed Tipping the Velvet with Affinity, another Victorian-set novel with gothic themes, and Fingersmith, also Victorian yet more of a Dickensian crime drama. All three have significant lesbian themes and characters; Waters often labels them as \"Victorian lesbo romps\". To avoid being pigeonholed as a niche writer, however , she followed these with The Night Watch, which also has gay and lesbian characters, but is set in the 1940s. For The Little Stranger, Waters diverted from overt lesbian themes, but incorporated other elements from previous books. A character in Affinity talks to spirits of the dead; the setting of Fingersmith is a large country estate inhabited by a small family and house staff; The Night Watch is set in post-WWII Britain with characters who are somewhat at a loss with what to do following the upheaval of war. Barry Didock in The Herald considers The Night Watch a companion piece to The Little Stranger. Waters states that the change from a conservative to socialist society was her true impetus for writing The Little Stranger: \"I didn't set out to write a haunted house novel. I wanted to write about what happened to class in that post-war setting. It was a time of turmoil in exciting ways. Working class people had come out of the war with higher expectations. They had voted in the Labour government. They want change.... So it was a culture in a state of change. But obviously for some people it was a change for the worse.\" She had originally set out to rewrite a version of The Franchise Affair by Josephine Tey, which is a courtroom thriller about a middle-class family accused of kidnapping a young girl. Waters is well known for the immense amount of research she conducts for her novels. Groundwork for The Night Watch also found its way into The Little Stranger; after this probing she concluded 1947 was \"a miserable year\". Much of her time preparing for this novel was spent in Warwickshire estate homes and local newspaper archives. She told The Globe and Mail I read a lot of novels from the period. And diaries were a wonderful resource. I also watched films from that period and went to museums and archives to look at ephemera from the period. I like to try to capture the idiom and slang... A writer at that time wouldn't have used profanity in a respectable novel. But if you look at diaries or letters, people were swearing all the time, in very modern-sounding ways. One of the excitements about writing about the past from the present is that you can put in a lot of the details that the mainstream novelists of the time couldn't because of the conventions of the time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

J. Hoberman of The Village Voice deemed it to have a \"cartoon ideology\" and justification for ruthless leadership comparable to Triumph of the Will. Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote an otherwise positive review but concluded: \"The movie, spectacular as it is, in the end confronts what must be called the tyrant's creed, and declares itself in agreement with the tyrant.\" The film also has been interpreted as a nuanced investigation into the relationship between culture on one hand, and political or military power on the other.

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.

Although it undeniably helps, you don't have to know your Heidegger from Hamburger Helper to enjoy The Addiction as a grisly yet unusual thriller of the supernatural.\" The Washington Posts Hal Hinson was less laudatory of Taylor's performance, writing that she \"seems less distinctive here than she has been in past roles.\" However, he praised Walken's performance, though summarized the film as \"serious and passionate; [Ferrara's] conviction, too, is unquestionable. However, when he flashes images of historic atrocities of both the distant and recent past\u2014Nazi death camps, the war dead in Bosnia\u2014his ideas come across as shallow and banal. Also, inserting scenes of real-life horror into what is essentially a glorified genre exercise may strike some as the essence of bad taste.\" Caryn James of The New York Times expressed a similar sentiment, noting \"When the film connects Kathleen's struggle to resist evil to My Lai and the Holocaust, those comparisons are exploitative in a way that even a genre-bending film can't get away with.\" Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun praised Taylor for portraying Kathleen \"with dour, sexless intensity,\" and deemed the film \"far sexier than Interview with the Vampire and far deadlier than the campy Nadja...\u00a0 It's extremely disturbing, a graduate- level movie for advanced students in either of three subjects: cinema, philosophy and debauchery.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the search of a bass player they met Milton R., who was drummer for the alternative rock band Santara\u00f1a and groove metal band BrujoNitro. Milton R. quit percussion to join the band as bassist. It should be noted as a precedent that Alex L. was a substitute drummer in the rock band 1280 Almas, a band whose boom in the 90s made them famous in the Colombian rock scene. Once this line-up was defined, the band took a new sound path, leaving post-punk and post-grunge behind to search for its own, more contemporary sound, moving away from the N\u00fc-metal sound that was so fashionable in Colombia on those years. Working experimentally in underground, INFO matures its proposal to officially present it in 2008. The name INFO refers to the word information, which represents everything that the new man needs: there are no longer limits to having information... \"the Internet, the media, the networks are at the hand of every human being to be exploited in pursuit of evolution\" . The name of the band arose in a spontaneous conversation about the change of the actual project name and was proposed by Milton R. in order to call the band the same in Spanish or English, taking as a point of inspiration the intro sample of the song Hero from the album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs by the band Ministry. First steps on industrial rock Looking for an advanced sound that would distinguish them in the new Colombian trends, Milton R. introduced the first programming sequences made with in a desktop computer creating the bass line of the song La Marcha using software from Image Line and Native Instruments. This new proposal of electronic rock combined with usual rock live instruments started the beginning of the band's full exploration of the sounds of industrial rock. Working on what would be this new industrial-electro sound for the band, they worked in the studio for two years until they released a 4-song EP that was released in 2006, which included a version of Muevete , an original Colombian rock classic from the mythical Estados Alterados. The song had the approval of Estados Alterados and was broadcast on alternative music channels in Bogota. By this time the group's musical influences are German industrial music, EBM and the sounds of bands like Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein, Die Krupps and Pain. Then they recorded their first video clip with the support of Billig Cinema, an independent company that produces audio and video productions. The direction was in charge of Larry Paipa and the chosen song was \"La Marcha\". The video rotated through channels with specialized shows such as CityTv in Bogot\u00e1 and Musinet in Medell\u00edn. As the second video, the single Muevete was chosen, recorded in June 2005, once again directed by Larry Paipa with a more ambitious production than the first video. By this time the band had the participation of Damian C. on keyboards, who left the band in 2006 to undertake personal projects. Consolidation In 2006 the band was invited to play on finals of the Festival de Rock Universitario in Bogota, Colombia. It was also summoned among the 32 preselected acts for the edition XII Rock al Parque Festival. They plerformed at the Electronic Tortazo 2006 at the Media Torta Open Air Theater in December 2006 alongside the best exponents of electro rock from Bogota. By June 2008, once their industrial metal sound had been consolidated the band performed as guests at Colombia's first gothic and industrial music festival, Bogota In Darkness. They participated in the Rock in Construction 2 festival in Surfonica, winning among more than 30 bands from various rock genres.

The group specialises in killing their victims using elaborate schemes that mask the murders as if they were accidents. Uncle , one of the team members, accidentally leaves a cigarette butt at the crime scene, and it is found by the Brain. After an argument, Uncle vows to quit smoking afterwards. The team then gets a job from a son that wants to kill his own father, likely for insurance money. They plan an accident to kill their target via electrocution, but the plan requires for it be to raining at a specific time. The team tries to execute their plan many times but fail due to the rain falling later than necessary.

However, the rain falls on time, and the team decides to go forth with their plan. Uncle forgets to play his part in the murder, but the murder is successfully executed nonetheless. Unexpectedly, after the murder, a bus loses control and almost runs over the Brain. The Brain manages to get out of the bus's path, but the bus then runs over Fatty , another member of the team, killing him on the scene. The Brain takes Fatty's belongings, with Fatty asking the Brain whether it really was an accident before he dies. The Brain then returns home to find police officers investigating his flat, which was broken into. The Brain becomes paranoid and is convinced that everything was a setup. He trails the son to an insurance company the next day. The Brain sees the son arguing with an insurance agent over what appears to be money, leading the Brain to suspect that the insurance agent was behind the bus accident. The Brain rents a flat on the floor directly below the insurance agent's flat, and begins to perform secret surveillance on the agent. One day, the Brain trails the client to find the Woman picking up the payment for the job at a parking garage. However, only Fatty and the Brain should have known about the pick-up. The Woman explains to the Brain that Fatty had told her about the client, but the Brain, suspecting her betrayal, kills her and takes the money. After he leaves, as he is walking on the sidewalk, the client falls from the roof of the same building and is dead. The Brain develops further suspicion of the insurance agent, who he can see talking on the phone and later hear him talking about the client on the phone in his flat. In a later date, the Brain receives a call from Uncle for help. However, the Brain is too late and finds Uncle severely injured, apparently dropping two stories from a building near the crime scene in the opening scene. The Brain decides to take revenge against the insurance agent and devises a scheme to kill the agent by reflecting the sun's rays to blind a car to run over the agent in what would appear to be an accident. However, in the middle of the plan's execution, there is a solar eclipse, blocking the sunlight. At this time, the Brain receives a call from Uncle in the hospital, who tells the Brain that Fatty's death really was an accident. Uncle had accidentally dropped a bag of toy balls that night, which led to the loss of control of the bus. Realizing he has made a mistake and that the agent is innocent, the Brain runs and tries to cover the windshield from reflecting light. The agent sees and recognises the Brain as he is running, but the Brain is too late, and a blinded driver runs over the agent's wife, killing her. On a later date, as the Brain is leaving the rented flat, he is confronted and stabbed by the insurance agent in the staircase, who asks the Brain why he had to harm them.

It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that \"the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the Half-Life story is absolute genius\", while GameSpy noted, \"What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration.\" The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the standalone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28\u00a0reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version. The game generated a fan following for the Weighted Companion Cube\u2014even though the cube itself does not talk or act in the game. Fans have created plush and papercraft versions of the cube and the various turrets, as well as PC case mods and models of the Portal cake and portal gun. Jeep Barnett, a programmer for Portal, noted that players have told Valve that they had found it more emotional to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube than to harm one of the \"Little Sisters\" from BioShock. Both GLaDOS and the Weighted Companion Cube were nominated for the Best New Character Award on G4, with GLaDOS winning the award for \"having lines that will be quoted by gamers for years to come.\" Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation praised the game as \"absolutely sublime from start to finish ... I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game\". He felt the short length was ideal as it did not outstay its welcome. Writing for GameSetWatch in 2009, columnist Daniel Johnson pointed out similarities between Portal and Erving Goffman's essay on dramaturgy, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, which equates one's persona to the front and backstage areas of a theater. The game was also made part of the required course material among other classical and contemporary works, including Goffman's work, for a freshman course \"devoted to engaging students with fundamental questions of humanity from multiple perspectives and fostering a sense of community\" for Wabash College in 2010. Portal has also been cited as a strong example of instructional scaffolding that can be adapted for more academic learning situations, as the player, through careful design of levels by Valve, is first hand-held in solving simple puzzles with many hints at the correct solution, but this support is slowly removed as the player progresses in the game, and completely removed when the player reaches the second half of the game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Hamish Todd considered Portal as an exemplary means of game design by demonstrating a series of chambers after the player has obtained the portal gun that gently introduce the concept of flinging without any explicit instructions. Portal was exhibited at the Smithsonian Art Exhibition in America from February 14 through September 30, 2012. Portal won the \"Action\" section for the platform \"Modern Windows\".

He has spent his whole life tending the garden and has never left the property. Other than gardening, his knowledge is derived entirely from what he sees on television. When his benefactor dies, Chance naively tells the lawyers that he has no claim against the estate and is ordered to move out. Chance wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. Passing by a TV shop, he sees himself captured by a camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a chauffeured car owned by elderly business mogul Ben Rand. In the car is Rand's glamorous and much younger wife Eve, who mishears \"Chance, the gardener\" in reply to the question who he is, as \"Chauncey Gardiner\". Eve brings Chance to their home to recover. He is wearing expensive tailored clothes from the 1920s and 1930s, which his benefactor had allowed him to take from the attic, and his manners are old-fashioned and courtly. When Ben Rand meets him, he takes \"Chauncey\" for an upper-class, highly educated businessman who has fallen on hard times. Rand admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful. Rand is also a confidant and advisor to the President of the United States, whom he introduces to \"Chauncey\". In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words \"stimulate growth\" and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes \u201cChauncey Gardiner\u201d in a speech. Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important dinners, develops a close connection with the Soviet ambassador, and appears on a television talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on what would be his presidential policy. Though he has now risen to the top of Washington society, the Secret Service and some 16 other agencies are unable to find any background information on him. During this time Rand's physician, Dr. Allenby, becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that the mystery of his identity may have a more mundane explanation. Dr. Allenby considers telling Rand this, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days. The dying Rand encourages Eve to become close to \"Chauncey\". She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, which happens to be showing on the TV. When the scene ends, Chauncey stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies \"I like to watch,\" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but decides she is willing to masturbate for his voyeuristic pleasure, thereby not noticing that he has turned back to the TV and is now imitating a yoga exercise on a different channel. Chance is present at Rand's death and shows genuine sadness at his passing. Questioned by Dr. Allenby, he admits that he \"loves Eve very much\" and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben's death, Allenby says to himself, \"I understand,\" but interpretation of that is left to the viewer. While the President delivers a speech at Rand's funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next term of office and unanimously agree on Chauncey Gardiner as successor. Oblivious to all this, Chance wanders off through Rand's wintry estate. He straightens out a pine sapling flattened by a fallen branch, then walks across the surface of a lake.

The three of them want to continue making music together, they wanted to change their sound, so they enlisted the help of Neil Godfrey, and eventually Jerry Oliveria, a bandmate of his in a previous band named \"Good Mourning\". They originally formed the band as \"Spank\", but due to legal reasons they were forced to change it.  Rob Zombie suggested they should call themselves Ultraspank, and the band ended up taking his suggestion. Self-titled In 1997, the band signed to Epic Records. The band decided to go with this label due to them being famous at the time for previously breaking other heavy bands such as Korn and Rage Against the Machine into mainstream popularity. Their debut, self-titled album was released on March 31, 1998. While the president of the company at the time of their signing fully supported the band, he was shortly afterwards fired, and the band received less support from the new president. Despite the lack of support, the band still toured tirelessly for two years, mostly on their own support, even using their own tour van, which racked up over 100,000 miles during the time. The band became demoralized with all the work being put into without any backing from the label. However, the band received another break. They were able to get one of their songs, \"Five\", on the PlayStation video game 3Xtreme. This brought the band a ton of exposure, as it was quoted as selling \"400,000 units\" and \"far more than their first album sold\". This brought them more support from Epic, so the band started work on a follow-up album. Progress After the heavy touring in support of their first album, the band returned to the studio for their followup Progress. Sonically, vocalist described the goal of the album was that he \"wanted to go further out on the melodic tip. As a band, our groove is one of the things we pride ourselves on the most, but there's a lot more melody on this record. It's not happy melody, but it's still emotional music.\" The name of the album represented a number of things for the band. Jerry Oliviera expanded on this in an interview, saying it's \"...a statement on where we're heading together as a society. The cover is a real photo, from a genetic engineering project, of a mouse with a human ear growing out of its back. It's supposed to be like, 'we're growing ears out of animals' backs. Yeah, that's progress.'\". The album name also represented the album's matured sound in comparison to the first, in its using of acoustic guitar, and using programming more to their advantage. Murray claims that the recording sessions were so intense, that there were many times where he or Godfrey would need to leave for a break, and that the album can still be hard for them to listen to on an emotional level. Progress was released on May 30, 2000, but didn't sell very well, yet again due to a lack of promotion. As a result, the band was dropped by their record label, leading to a breakup. Post-breakup After the break up, Murray took some time away from music, while Godfrey joined downthesun and Motograter for a short period. After leaving those bands, he went on to form Lo-Pro with former vocalist Murray in 2002. The band has released two albums, a self-titled release in 2003 and The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge in 2010, and the band is still presently together. In 2008, rumors arose about the band reuniting. However, things had been taken out of context, as what was being referenced to was the fact that guitarist Oliviera was joining Lo-Pro as a replacement bassist, making it so now Lo-Pro had three Ultraspank members in the band. The \"reuniting\" was the fact that Murray, Godrey, and Oliviera all played on Lo-Pro's 2010 release The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge as they had in both Ultraspank releases.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1435", "question": "What genre is Another World?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The main Mario subseries is the Super Mario series of platform games started with 1985's Super Mario Bros., which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the Mushroom Kingdom and typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through levels. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and several sub-series, including Mario Golf, Mario Kart, Mario Party, Mario Tennis, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and Paper Mario; several characters introduced in the Mario franchise, such as Donkey Kong, Wario, and Yoshi, sparked successful franchises of their own. The Mario series is one of gaming's most successful and renowned franchises, with many of its games, in particular within the Super Mario subseries, being considered to be some of the greatest video games ever made. It is the best-selling video game franchise of all time, with more than 758.06 million copies of games sold, including 388.92 million for the Super Mario games alone. Mario has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1444", "question": "What genre is The Great Ziegfeld?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_14567", "text": "The screenplay by William Anthony McGuire was a \"novelty\" to many audiences who were familiar with the theatrical Broadway shows of the follies. The script, although fictionalized with embellishments needed for the motion picture, did show some accuracies in the life of Ziegfeld. Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times said of the script: \"What William Anthony McGuire has attempted in his screen play, and with general success, is to encompass not merely the fantastic personal history of Ziegfeld but the cross-sectional story of the development of the Follies, the Midnight Frolic on the New Amsterdam Roof and the other theatrical enterprises floated under the Glorifier's aegis during a span of about forty years. The two biographies\u2014of the man and of his creations\u2014are, naturally, inseparable; but both have been told with such wealth of detail and circumstance that even the three-hour film narrative is fragmentary and, in some places, confused.\" Although it has some accuracies, The Great Ziegfeld takes many key liberties with Ziegfeld's life and the history of the Follies, resulting in many inaccuracies. The earlier scenes with Sandow, the milk bath advertising scenario, and many other sequences including several of the dramatic ups and downs of the film were fictional. George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue was never featured in the Follies, and the number \"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody\" was written for the 1919 Follies, not the first edition of the revue, as shown in the film. Ray Bolger was never cast in a \"Follies\" show, and although she was born in the U.S, Billie Burke grew up in England and spoke with a Mid-Atlantic accent throughout her life; Loy who portrays her clearly has an American accent in the film. In the film, the last few lines of the song \"Ol' Man River\" are sung by what sounds like a tenor, while the song was intended for bass Paul Robeson and sung in the original production by bass-baritone Jules Bledsoe. Further, the screenplay also gives the impression that the successful original production of Show Boat, which Ziegfeld produced, closed because of the Great Depression. In fact Show Boat ended its original 1927 run in the spring of 1929 and the stock market crash did not occur until October of that year. It was the 1932 revival of the show , not the original production, that was affected by the Depression. In real life, Ziegfeld did not die in his room at the Hotel Warwick which stood in front of the Ziegfeld Theatre; he actually died in Los Angeles and had not even spent his last years in New York. However, McGuire did capture a number of Ziegfeld's traits, such as sending telegrams to people even in close proximity, his belief that elephants were a symbol of good luck, his exquisite taste in costumes and design, and perfectionism over his productions, especially lighting and rostrum pedestaling. McGuire's script, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California, is dated September 21, 1935, probably the date when it was finalized.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Humans have had limited success understanding the left-behind bits of Heechee technology found there and elsewhere. The Gateway Corporation administers the asteroid on behalf of the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the New People's Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United States of Brazil. There are nearly a thousand small, abandoned starships at Gateway. By extremely dangerous trial and error, humans have partially learned how to operate them. The controls for selecting a destination have been identified, but nobody knows where a particular setting will take the ship, how long the trip will last or even if there is enough fuel to get back. Those who choose to risk their lives cram the limited space with equipment and hopefully enough food for the trip, but sometimes it is not enough, and they have to resort first to cannibalism, and if that is not enough, to suicide. Attempts at reverse engineering to find out how the ships work have ended only in disaster, as has changing the settings in mid-flight. Most settings lead to useless or lethal places. A few, however, result in the discovery of new Heechee artifacts and habitable planets in other star systems, making the crews extremely wealthy. The vessels come in three standard sizes, which can hold a maximum of one, three, or five people. Some \"threes\" and many \"fives\" are armored. Each ship includes a lander to visit a planet or other object if one is found. Despite the risks, many people on impoverished, overcrowded Earth dream of going to Gateway. Robinette Stetley Broadhead is a young food shale miner who wins a lottery, giving him enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway. Once there, he is frightened of the danger and puts off going on a mission as long as he can. In the meantime, he becomes romantically involved with two different women, eventually settling on Gelle-Klara Moynlin, his co-enabler in fearful delaying. Eventually he starts running out of money, and although still terrified, he goes out on three trips. The first, with Klara and three others, is unsuccessful, and afterwards tension rises between them until he gives her a vicious beating. On the second trip, he goes by himself and inadvertently makes a discovery through unauthorized experimentation when he becomes infuriated after reaching Gateway Two, a smaller version of Gateway with only about 150 ships. He is awarded a sizable bonus because his route saves about 100 days of travel time; the windfall is partially offset by the large penalty for incapacitating his ship. On his third trip, the Gateway Corporation tries something different: sending two armored fives, one slightly behind the other, to the same destination, one rejected by most ships' computers; each crewmember is promised a million dollar bonus. Bob signs up in desperation, along with Klara, with whom he has reconciled. When the ships arrive, their crews find to their horror that they are in the gravitational grip of a black hole without enough power to break free. One person devises a desperate escape plan: Move everyone into one ship and thrust the other toward the black hole with an explosion in a lander, thus gaining enough of a boost to escape. They work frantically to transfer unnecessary equipment to make room for everyone in one ship, but Broadhead finds himself alone in the wrong ship when time runs out. He closes the hatch so that the plan can proceed. However, his ship is the one that breaks free. Broadhead returns to Gateway and is awarded all the mission bonuses. He feels such enormous survivor guilt for dooming his crewmates, especially Klara, that he suppresses his memories of what happened. However, he is very disturbed and miserable, though he does not understand why, so back on Earth as a wealthy man, he seeks therapy from an artificial intelligence Freudian therapist program which he names Sigfrid von Shrink. The narrative alternates in time between Broadhead's experiences on Gateway and his sessions with Sigfrid, converging on the traumatic events near the black hole and Broadhead finally remembering them so that he can begin to heal. Sigfrid helps him realize that, due to the gravitational time dilation of the black hole's immense gravity field, time is passing much more slowly for his former crewmates and none of them have actually died yet. Broadhead, however, concludes that this means that they will still be alive when he dies, with Klara still believing that he betrayed them to save himself. Also embedded in the narrative are various mission reports , roster openings, technical bulletins, and other documents Broadhead might have read on Gateway, adding to the verisimilitude.  The economic side of living at Gateway is presented in detail, commencing with the contract all explorers must enter into with the Gateway Corporation, and including how some awards are determined.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_1446", "question": "What genre is Lutheran Worship?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_76009", "text": "Lutheran Worship is, essentially, a revision of the green-covered Lutheran Book of Worship of 1978 that was the common liturgical book and hymnal of the old Lutheran Church in America, American Lutheran Church, and Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, which later merged in 1988 to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The LCMS began work on the LBW in 1965 as a revision of TLH of 1941 and the other Lutheran churches' book, the Service Book and Hymnal of 1958 and invited other Lutheran denominations in North America to participate in the creation of the hymnal. Due to disagreements and compromise with some of the other denominations involved in the project, however, the LBW was published in 1978 without the endorsement of the very church body which initiated its production, when more conservative leaders assumed leadership after 1974 amidst a theological controversy and schism. Following the rejection of the LBW, the LCMS quickly set about revising the new hymnal to remove the objectionable content, and LW was published in 1982. Lutheran Worship includes orders for Holy Communion entitled Divine Service I , Divine Service II , and Divine Service III .  It also includes orders for Matins, Vespers, and Compline, as well as services for Holy Baptism and Confirmation. There is also Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, the Bidding Prayer, the Litany, the Lectionary, Luther's Small Catechism, Confession , and a collection of Psalms. The bulk of the hymnal consists of 11 canticles and chants, 491 hymns, and 18 spiritual songs. Despite the revisions undertaken by the LCMS, many members and congregations still rejected LW due to what many viewed as unnecessary and awkward modifications in language to well-known materials. Objections centered on the modifications made to Divine Service I and a number of well-known hymns. Following the precedent set by the LBW and the common trend around North American Christianity at the time, archaic language was widely updated, resulting in worshipers frequently stumbling over hymn verses and passages that had been familiar to them for many years. Examples of hymns that were significantly altered in the new hymnal include \"My Faith Looks Up to Thee\", \"I Am Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus\", and \"We Give Thee But Thine Own\", all of which are well-known and familiar hymns among Lutherans but were heavily modified in LW . Additionally, many familiar hymns were set to new melodies that proved unpopular. Examples include \"Ride On, Ride On in Majesty\", \"The Day of Resurrection\", and \"God Loved the World So That He Gave\". In many ways, LW proved to be a major contributor to the controversies that tore at the LCMS in the later part of the twentieth century, as the synod suddenly found itself lacking unity even in the hymnal used in its congregations. By 1999, only 58% of the synod was using LW as its primary hymnal, with the majority of the remaining congregations retaining TLH and a handful of others using LBW or other hymnals such as SBH. Lutheran Worship is commonly referred to as the \"Blue hymnal,\" because of its bound cover in contrast with TLH - the \"Red hymnal\". The one notable exception to \"Lutheran Worship\" being blue is in the case of Concordia Lutheran Church in San Antonio, TX, whose founding pastor, the Reverend Doctor Guido Merkens, insisted at a synodical meeting that he wanted green covers. Not wanting to ruffle the feathers of the man who at that time had the fastest-growing LCMS church in the nation, a popular syndicated TV show known as \"Breakthrough,\" and a \"Television Sunday School\" with a wide audience, the Synod and publishers relented, and hundreds of \"Lutheran Worship\" hymnals were produced in a dark green color to match the color scheme of Dr. Merkens' church. A new hymnal published in 2006, Lutheran Service Book, is intended to replace both LW and TLH as the common hymnal of the LCMS. Concordia Publishing House has announced that all LW-related supplemental materials, including specialized accompaniment and large-print editions and the agenda, will go out of print when current supplies are depleted, although the pew edition will continue to be produced for the foreseeable future. LW remains an official hymnal of the LCMS, and it is unlikely that it will ever be formally decommissioned.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2007, Yoshizumi announced two classes of Tales games, \"Mothership Titles\" and \"Escort Titles\". \"Mothership\" essentially means \"Main series\", where as \"Escort\" essentially means \"Spinoff\". One of the recurring differences between the two game types internally is that \"Escort\" titles don't supply inspiration for main entries in the series, but draw the most popular elements from them. The games are also frequently given what is called a \"Characteristic Genre Name\", which is essentially a short subtitle or phrase that outlines the game's overall theme. The main reason for this, as stated by Yoshizumi, was that the series was not seen as a role-playing series by the development team, but rather \"Character Playing Game\", with the player learning about the game's characters and watching them grow rather than using them as avatars: the genre names are meant to distinguish them from other role-playing games. The terms, however, are largely removed from the English localized versions.

He also authored a number of books on computer programming during the 1980s. In his earliest published literature, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff builds up his own literary universe. The Dialog om det 21. \u00e5rhundredes to vigtigste verdenssystemer, , is a philosophical dialogue modelled on the classical style of Galileo Galilei's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The plot is set in a not too distant future, where a Danish civil war has broken out. The reader is witnessing a debate between three persons, one representing a new humanistic view on mankind and its new ideology , called Wulffianism. Wulffianism is anarchic in the word's real sense, entailing an acceptance of violence as a means and denial of modern civilization. This, as expected, caused severe public controversy. Other books from this early period of the authorship are anthologies of essays and poems, and mainly appear as supplements to the mentioned dialogues. All of Neutzsky-Wulff's poetry is in rhyme, metrical with a touch of subtle pastiche. With the episodic novel Adam Harts Opdagelser <5> , Neutzsky-Wulff began to find his style and obtained henceforth crowds of fans. The book's protagonists are Adam Hart and his partner Victor Janis, both working as \"occult detectives\". An ironically rendered Neutzsky-Wulff himself also appears in a more secondary role. The series continues with the episodic Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen <6> Victor Janis og s\u00f8n <7> , both representing a more conventional novel structure, and ends with an experimental novel, Oiufael , mainly written in verse. An episode from Adam Hart og sj\u00e6lemaskinen was adapted as the short film Adam Hart i Sahara , based on his own screenplay. Though sometimes he breaks the traditional conventions of the genre, Neutzsky-Wulff sees himself as an author of science fiction. He emphasizes the genre as the most prominent stage of artistic interpretations of the mythology of our time. Anno Domini tells the story of an astronaut on a strange planet, experiencing a macrohistorical version of the evolution of humankind. In Gud <8> , the classical form of science fiction itself, is challenged: A group of people are, by means of an alien vessel, heading towards the planet of God. With Den 33. marts <9> , the plot is altered from outer to \"inner space\", a platform resembling that of an American author of science fiction, Philip K. Dick.

In a sanitarium, this person \"hallucinates\" about another world where he features as an awaited Messiah. Havet <10> is, like Anno Domini and Gud, a novel about space travel. The supernatural setting pivots around the cards of Tarok. In Menneske <11> , a computer independently achieves consciousness and decides to find out what existence as a human being is like.

There was some substantive difference, however, as the New Yorker Fifth Avenue used a slightly longer chassis than the standard car. The new New Yorker Fifth Avenue's larger interior volume classified it as a full-size model this time; despite having smaller exterior dimensions than the first generation. For 1990, Chrysler's new 3.3\u00a0L V6 engine was the standard and only choice, teamed with the company's A-604 four-speed electronic automatic transaxle. Beginning in 1991, a larger 3.8\u00a0L V6 became optional. It delivered the same 147 horsepower as the 3.3, but had more torque. The New Yorker Fifth Avenue's famous seats, long noted for their button-tufted appearance and sofa-like comfort, continued to be offered with the customer's choice of velour or leather, with the former \"Corinthian leather\" replaced by that of the Mark Cross company. Leather-equipped cars bore the Mark Cross logo on the seats and, externally, on an emblem attached to the brushed aluminum band ahead of the rear door opera windows. In this form, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue resembled the newly revived Chrysler Imperial, although some much-needed distinction was provided between the cars when the New Yorker Fifth Avenue received restyled, rounded-off front and rear ends for the 1992 model year, while the Imperial continued in its original crisply-lined form. The early 1990s saw a revival of the Imperial as a high-end sedan in Chrysler's lineup. Unlike the 1955\u20131983 Imperial, this car was a model of Chrysler, not its own marque. Based on the Y platform, it represented the top full-size model in Chrysler's lineup; below it was the similar New Yorker Fifth Avenue, and below that was the shorter wheelbase New Yorker. The reintroduction of the Imperial was two years after the Lincoln Continental was changed to a front-wheel-drive sedan with a V6 engine. Other domestic competitors in this segment included the Cadillac Sedan de Ville/Fleetwood, Oldsmobile 98, and Buick Electra/Park Avenue. Though closely related, the Imperial differed from the New Yorker Fifth Avenue in many ways. The Imperial's nose was more wedge-shaped, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue's had a sharper, more angular profile . The rears of the two cars also differed. Like the front, the New Yorker Fifth Avenue's rear came to stiffer angles while the Imperial's rear-end came to more rounded edges. Also found on the Imperial were full-width taillights which were similar to those of the Chrysler TC, as well as the early 1980s Imperial coupe, while the New Yorker Fifth Avenue came with smaller vertical taillights. Initially, the 1990 Imperial was powered by the  3.3\u00a0L EGA V6 engine, which was rated at  of torque. For 1991, the 3.3\u00a0L V6 was replaced by the larger 3.8\u00a0L EGH V6. Although horsepower only increased to , with the new larger 3.8\u00a0L V6 torque increased to  at 2750 rpm. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard with both engines. Also new for 1990 was a redesigned LeBaron sedan which offered a standard V6 engine. Later models would also be available with 4 cylinder engines. The Town & Country minivan was restyled for 1991 in conjunction with the restyling of the Dodge and Plymouth minivan models. 1991 would also be the last year for the TC by Maserati, leaving the LeBaron as the brand's sole coupe and convertible options. The first generation of the Chrysler Concorde debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as a 1993 model. It debuted as a single, well-equipped model with a base price of US$18,341. Out of all the LH sedans, the first generation Concorde was most closely related to the Eagle Vision. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all sheetmetal in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, body side moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler's signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body-colored strips with the Chrysler Pentastar logo on the center strip. The Concorde's rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height lightbar between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde's body side moldings incorporated bright chrome work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray came all the way up to the chrome beltline; on Visions, the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans ; Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles. Introduced in May 1993 for the 1994 model year, the Chrysler LHS was the top-of-the-line model for the division, as well as the most expensive of the Chrysler LH platform cars. All the LH-series models shared a  wheelbase and were developed using Chrysler's new computer drafting system. The car was differentiated from the division's New Yorker sedan by its bucket leather seats and standard features such as alloy wheels that were options on the New Yorker. Further differences between the Chrysler LHS and its New Yorker counterpart were a floor console and shifter, five-passenger seating, lack of chrome trim, an upgraded interior and a sportier image. The New Yorker was dropped after the 1996 model year in favor of a six-passenger option on the LHS. The LHS received a minor face change in 1995 when the corporate-wide Pentastar emblem was replaced with the revived Chrysler brand emblem. Standard features of the LHS included a 3.5\u00a0L EGE 24-valve  V6 engine, body-colored grille, side mirrors and trim, traction control, aluminum wheels, integrated fog lights, 8-way power-adjustable front seats, premium sound systems with amplifiers, and automatic temperature control. Unlike the New Yorker, leather seats were standard. The final generation of the New Yorker continued with front-wheel drive on an elongated version of the new Chrysler LH platform and was released in May 1993 along with the nearly identical Chrysler LHS as an early 1994 model, eight months after the original LH cars: the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision, were introduced. The New Yorker came standard with the 3.5\u00a0L EGE which produced . Chrysler gave the New Yorker a more \"traditional American\" luxury image, and the LHS a more European performance image . Little separated New Yorker from LHS in appearance, with New Yorker's chrome hood trim, body-color cladding, standard chrome wheel covers and 15-inch wheels, column shifter, and front bench seat, being the only noticeable differences. An option provided for 16-inch wheels and a firmer suspension type . This option eliminated the technical differences between New Yorker and LHS. LHS came with almost all of New Yorker's optional features as standard equipment and featured the firmer tuned suspension, to go with its more European image. During the 1994 model run, various changes were made to the New Yorker. On the outside, New Yorker was switched to new accent-color body cladding, whereas LHS received body-color cladding. This change aligned New Yorker with the Chrysler Concorde which also had accent-color cladding. Instead of standard 15-inch and optional 16-inch wheels, for the sake of enhanced stability 16-inch wheels became standard and the 15-inch versions were dropped. Likewise, the touring suspension option available on early 1994 New Yorker models was discontinued, leaving only \"ride-tuned\" suspension. In 1995, the Chrysler Sebring was introduced as a coupe, replacing the LeBaron coupe, and the new JA platform Chrysler Cirrus replaced the outgoing LeBaron sedan. A year later, a convertible version of the Sebring went on the market and replaced the LeBaron convertible. In 1999, Chrysler introduced the new LH platform 300M sedan alongside a redesigned LHS. The 300M was originally designed to be the next-generation Eagle Vision but since the Eagle brand had been discontinued in 1998, it instead became a Chrysler sedan.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_1455", "question": "What genre is Light Years?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_32845", "text": "Brian Michael Bendis, Michael Avon Oeming and David W. Mack became friends while all three were working on individual small press projects. Bendis says that he also began to \"analyz[e] why it was that I [had] never attempted to write a superhero comic\" at the time, while he was writing crime books such as Jinx and Goldfish, despite his love of the genre. Concluding that Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen had sufficiently explored the genre, Bendis decided to work in other genres. The series' concept was derived from his love of crime fiction and police procedurals in general, as well as specific works such as Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, Janis Joplin's biography, Taxi Driver, T-Men, Traffic and Visions Of Light: The Art of Cinematography, and would take the form of a Behind the Music-type look at superheroes. Powers, Oeming says, is \"a superhero universe seen through the eyes of the police... [as] observed by the media\" and everyday individuals. Bendis' intention was to view the \"cliches of the superhero genre through the harder eyes of the cops\", but with the added layer that \"every arc has some footing in a famous rock star story\". Bendis' scripts are often compiled from \"a list of scenes\", eschewing \"the big exploding ending\" in favor of a \"character-driven or psychological ending\". Indeed, in experimenting with plots, the duo swiftly moved beyond 'mere' police procedurals , constantly pushing each other creatively in new ways. In conceiving plots for the series, Bendis emphasizes the purpose and themes in the narrative over \"just being cool\", and allowing the theme to dictate the direction of the story. Bendis would collaborate with Oeming, who had already expressed interest in producing a crime/noir comic with Bendis, inspired by his attempts to get work on Batman Adventures to do a book in a style reminiscent of Bruce Timm and Alex Toth. Bendis cites two images produced by Oeming as originating the then-experimental \"Powers' style\" and \"inspir[ing] everything in [Powers]\". Indeed, Bendis and Oeming's first collaboration was \"Mall Outing\" in Jinx: True Crime Confessions. It is included in Little Deaths \"for Powers completists and curiosity's sake\". Oeming has noted that, although seen as an overtly \"cartoony\" style, the artwork does not appeal to children, which helps sidestep the potential problem of the book, which contains mature content, being purchased by customers younger than its intended audience. Despite both creators only having produced work in black and white before Powers, Bendis envisioned Powers in color, and convinced Oeming that it could work, despite the dramatically higher number of sales required to sustain a color comic. Bendis also convinced Oeming that the book should juxtapose both the superhero and crime noir genres, as Oeming initially shied away from the former. Bendis writes in the 'Sketchbook' section of the Powers: Who Killed Retro Girl? TPB that \"one of the rules of film noir is that the city itself should be considered a lead character\". To this end, he made Oeming watch Visions of Light, a documentary by the American Cinematographers Institute about the art of lighting in film, which he saw as important to the feel of comics also. According to Oeming, both he and Bendis do copious research for their projects, and that before he began the series, he would do ride-alongs with police, meet police officials, and take extensive photo reference of their equipment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A prescient review by Peter Nicholls in 1992, called The Thing \"a black, memorable film [that] may yet be seen as a classic\". It has been called one of, if not the best film directed by Carpenter. John Kenneth Muir called it \"Carpenter's most accomplished and underrated directorial effort\", and critic Matt Zoller Seitz said it \"is one of the greatest and most elegantly constructed B-movies ever made\". Trace Thurman described it as one of the best films ever, and in 2008, Empire magazine selected it as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, at number 289, calling it \"a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror\". It is now considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, and a classic of the genre. Several publications have called it one of the best films of 1982, including Filmsite.org, Film.com, and Entertainment Weekly. Muir called it \"the best science fiction-horror film of 1982, an incredibly competitive year, and perhaps even the best genre motion picture of the decade\". Complex named it the ninth-best of the decade, calling it the \"greatest genre remake of all time\". Numerous publications have ranked it as one of the best science fiction films, including number four by IGN ; number 12 by Thrillist ; number 17 by GamesRadar+ ; number 31 by Paste ; number 32 by Esquire and Popular Mechanics ; and number 76 by Rotten Tomatoes based on its average review score. Similarly, The Thing has appeared on several lists of the top horror films, including number one by The Boston Globe; number two by Bloody Disgusting ; number four by Empire ; and number six by Time Out . Empire listed its poster as the 43rd best film poster ever. In 2016, the British Film Institute named it one of 10 great films about aliens visiting Earth. It was voted the ninth best horror film of all time in a Rolling Stone readers poll, and is considered one of the best examples of body horror. GamesRadar+ listed its ending as one of the 25 best of all time.

Executive producer Guillaume de Fondaumi\u00e8re claimed it was the highest-rated in its genre since Grim Fandango and considered the release a commercial success, with over one million copies sold. It was named the best adventure game of 2005 by Computer Games Magazine, GameSpy, PC Gamer, and IGN; Adventure Gamers ranked it fifty-seventh of all time. Game Informer listed Fahrenheit last among ten video game openings. Garnett Lee of 1Up.com praised the \"disturbing\" and graceful nature of the story as well as its combination with the gameplay, saying Fahrenheit had set a new standard for future aims of doing so. GameSpots Alex Navarro highlighted the layers of context and \"heartfelt meaning\" to its use of cinematic gameplay. He enjoyed the narrative, dubbing it \"deep, captivating\", and, echoing Lee, \"disturbing\". The character development, art style, voice acting, and music also saw approval from Navarro. Raymond M. Padilla at GameSpy declared that \"it's so good that it just might save a dying genre\", regarding the plot and main characters to be well-written and the voice cast as one of the best of the year. The controls were admired for their accessibility, while the score was complimented for its \"moody and captivating\" qualities. Writing for GameZone, Ronnie Hobbs liked that the controls helped with narrative immersion, and that this created an emotional connection to the characters. Hobbs' verdict read: \"Despite its flaws, Indigo Prophecy is the definitive interactive story, and not only does it perfect the genre, it redefines it\". Charles Onyett, reviewing the game for IGN, thought it succeeded in its effort to provide a movie-like experience. The feature of multiple playable characters was believed to have worked well, the action choreography and voice acting impressed him, and the soundtrack was described as gripping. Conversely, Lee expressed dislike to the \"rather weakly implemented Metal Gear Solid-like stealth sections\" and Fahrenheits final third, which he perceived to be rushed. Navarro agreed with Lee on the ending and sneak sequences, criticising the former for its incoherent aspects and latter because it lacked engagement, matching the reason he disapproved of the puzzles. Additionally, Navarro complained that the graphics were unsightly. Padilla disparaged the PC version for being worse than its console counterparts, calling the keyboard and mouse setup \"not fun\". He noted that button commands would sometimes distract from on-screen events. As with Navarro, Padilla termed the graphics an \"undeniable flaw\". Hobbs found it difficult to endure the \"awkward\" camera angles and \"questionable\" character movements. Onyett noticed the same control problem, opining that this could become \"difficult and tedious\". He was displeased with the effects of playing on a computer and, like Lee and Navarro, took issue with the last portions of the game. Onyett chastised the graphics' \"fuzzy\" edges and \"bland\" textures along with the \"stilted and awkward\" animations.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, his obsession with speed often makes him an outcast in the slow and cautious snail community, and a constant embarrassment to his older brother, Chet. One night, Theo wanders onto a freeway to admire the traffic and wishes upon a star, later revealed to be an airplane, that he was fast. Suddenly, he is sucked into the supercharger of a Chevrolet Camaro drag racer, fusing his atoms with nitrous oxide. When he wakes up, he possesses superspeed and some characteristics of a real car. However, his first attempt to try out his new powers ends with him crashing a boy's tricycle into the garden in which many other snails work, resulting in him and Chet getting fired from the garden crew. Chet angrily scolds Theo for his recklessness and ends up being snatched by a crow, but is pursued and rescued by Theo at a run-down strip mall called Starlight Plaza. There, they are captured by Tito Lopez, a Mexican-American taco truck driver, and are brought to a snail race held by him and his co-workers. Theo wins the race in a matter of seconds, astounding both humans and snails alike, earning the respect of the snails, led by Whiplash, and firmly establishing the name \"Turbo\" as his own. Chet, on the other hand, is not happy with his brother's new ability. Tito dreams of reviving Starlight Plaza, in which his taco business is set up, with Turbo as an attraction, much to his brother and coworker Angelo's annoyance. The snails eventually manage to divert and strand a tour bus, bringing impressive business. At this success, Turbo convinces Tito to enter him in the Indianapolis 500 as a competitor. The neighbors agree to put up the entrance fee and accompany them to Indianapolis. Tito is initially refused entry into the race due to insulting a race official, but a chance meeting with Gagn\u00e9 gives Turbo a chance to show off his speed, astounding the audience and the racers by qualifying for the race via achieving a speed of 226 mph, becoming a sensation on social media and forcing the CEO of IndyCar to reluctantly let Turbo compete. The night before the race, after a heated argument with Chet, Turbo sneaks out to meet Gagn\u00e9, who reveals his true colors by demoralizing him. In the race, the racetrack and the more experienced competitors leave him trailing in last place. At a pitstop, Whiplash and the crew give Turbo a vital pep talk, advising him to stop racing like a car. Turbo uses his small size to his advantage and rapidly gains ground, but Gagn\u00e9 resorts to cheating and knocks him against the wall, damaging his shell and weakening his superspeed. With one lap to go and Turbo in the lead, Gagn\u00e9, refusing to lose to a snail, inadvertently drives over debris on the last turn, causing a pile-up involving most of the competitors, including Turbo, who wakes to find his shell punctured and his superspeed gone, so he falls into deep despair. Alarmed at seeing his brother losing hope, Chet, with a change of heart, braves several dangers to meet with Whiplash's crew. Seeing Chet and the crew arrive on crows to encourage him to continue, Turbo resumes the race. Gagn\u00e9 single-mindedly pursues him, dragging his wrecked car, but Turbo narrowly wins and Gagn\u00e9 is assaulted by one of the strip mall business owners for trying to harm him. Starlight Plaza thrives from Turbo's fame; all the businesses become spectacular successes and hold elaborate snail races. Whiplash's crew are given special propulsion aids for their shells, while Chet is content with his new job as the track referee and paramedic. As for Turbo, he discovers that his shell has healed, and with it, his superspeed has returned.

Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that.

Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other.

Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie...

After struggling with record labels for years, Stevie Rachelle decided to form his own label for the band and in early 1994, Rachelle officially started RLS Records. The initials had a dual meaning. The first was \"Record Labels Suck\" and the second was \"Rachelle's Lyrics & Songs\". The offshoot, Cheezee Records, was formed in 1996 to be the home for the singer's side project, Cheeseheads with Attitude. Tuff again signed with a record label in early 1995 when BMG/Mausoleum/MMS records picked up the RLS Fist First release after it sold upwards of 10,000 copies. BMG re-issued it as Religious Fix in June 1995 with three bonus tracks. The additional tracks were produced by Randy Cantor. In 2001, Tuff released the compilation CD, The History of Tuff which included the song \"American Hair Band\", a parody of Kid Rock's \"American Bad Ass\" . \"American Hair Band\" made references to numerous similar bands of the era, as well as criticizing grunge and alternative rock. Tuff re-released What Comes Around Goes Around Again in 2012, which featured four re-recorded songs from What Comes Around Goes Around plus new tracks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The creature was designed by Chin Wei-chen, the modeling was done by New Zealand-based Weta Workshop and the animatronics were by John Cox's creature Workshop. The CGI for the film was done by The Orphanage, which also did some of the visual effects in The Day After Tomorrow. The monster was designed with some specific parameters in mind. According to the director himself the inspiration came from a local article about a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the Han River. Therefore, the director's wishes were for it to look like an actual mutated fish-like creature, rather than have a more fantastical design. In the opening scenes of the film, two fishermen presumably encounter the creature whilst it is still small enough to fit in one of their cups; suggestive of its humble, more realistic origins. The monster also exhibits frontal limbs similar to amphibians' legs. This element of its design seems to have been more a choice of functionality on the designers' part as the monster needed to be able to run and perform certain acrobatic movements during the film. For a genre film monster, the creature's size is rather small, only about the size of a truck. Also unlike in many other monster-themed films, the creature is fully visible from early on in the film, sometimes for large stretches of time and even in broad daylight, which earned the film some critical praise.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The consensus reads: \"Thanks in large part to one of Denzel Washington's most powerful on-screen performances, The Hurricane is a moving, inspirational sports drama, even if it takes few risks in telling its story.\" Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun Times, liked the film and the acting, and wrote, \"This is one of Denzel Washington's great performances, on a par with his work in Malcolm X.... Washington as Hurricane Carter is spare, focused, filled with anger and pride.... This is strong stuff, and I was amazed, after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film, to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts, until at the end I was blinking at tears. What affects me emotionally at the movies is never sadness, but goodness.\" Metacritic gave the score a film of 74 based on 30 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Ebert discussed his perspective on the \"fictionalized\" aspects of the film: \"Several people have told me dubiously that they heard the movie was 'fictionalized'. Well, of course it was. Those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. Most biopics, like most grandmothers, see the good in a man and demonize his enemies. They pass silently over his imprudent romances. In dramatizing his victories, they simplify them. And they provide the best roles to the most interesting characters. If they didn't, we wouldn't pay to see them.\" He added, \"The Hurricane is not a documentary but a parable, in which two lives are saved by the power of the written word.\" Film critic Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, had mixed views of the film but praised the acting. He wrote: \"In telling the story of Mr. Carter's protracted and ultimately successful fight for freedom and justice, The Hurricane rides to glory on an astonishing performance by Denzel Washington.... That is to say, Mr. Washington leans into an otherwise schlocky movie and slams it out of the ballpark. If his Hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility, it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his character's forcefully articulate surface.\" Holden was forthright about the veracity of the film, writing, \"The film is so eager to stir us up that it thinks little of bending the facts for dramatic effect. Among its most egregious distortions is its depiction of Mr. Carter's 1964 middleweight title match with Joey Giardello. The movie inaccurately portrays the fight as lost by Carter solely because of the judges' racism. The taking of such license, of course, adds an extra jolt of drama. But when these and other distortions and exaggerations are added up, it's worth wondering if that self-congratulatory glow the movie leaves us with has been gotten far too easily and at what cost.\" Jewison considers The Hurricane his best work.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In spite of the apparent conclusion, this was then followed by a weekly television series, V: The Series, from 1984 to 1985 that continued the story a year after The Final Battle. Johnson left V during production of The Final Battle due to disagreements with NBC over how the story should progress. In November 2005, Entertainment Weekly named V one of the 10 best miniseries on DVD. The article noted, \"As a parable about it-can-happen-here fascism, V was far from subtle, but it carved a place for lavish and intelligent sci-fi on TV. Its impact can still be felt in projects like Taken and The 4400.\" In December 2008, Entertainment Weekly put V on its list \"The Sci-Fi 25: The Genre's Best Since 1982\", and called Visitor leader Diana's devouring a guinea pig \"one of the best TV reveals ever.\" For many years, Johnson has campaigned to revive V, and even wrote a sequel novel, V: The Second Generation, which picked up the story 20 years after the original miniseries . Warner Bros. Television declined to make a continuation as Johnson had planned, and opted for a remake instead. A reimagining of V premiered on ABC on November 3, 2009, and ran for two seasons. Though Johnson was not involved in the remake, which featured all new characters, executive producer Scott Peters said that it would nod to the most iconic moments from the original franchise and may potentially include actors from the original in new roles. Both Jane Badler and Marc Singer appeared in the second season. As of 2009, Johnson has also said he is still moving ahead with his plans for a big-screen remake of his original V miniseries though no progress has been made.

Nolan has denied that the film criticizes the Occupy movement, and insists that none of his Batman films are intended to be political: \"I've had as many conversations with people who have seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' \u2013 well, obviously, that's not true.\" Alternatively, politically-conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh alleged that the film was biased against 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney due to Bane's name being a homophone for Bain Capital, the financial service company Romney used to head, despite the fact that the character has existed as a major Batman foe since 1993. In response, Nolan said that the comments were \"bizarre\", while Dixon and Freeman said that the comments were \"ridiculous\". Democratic adviser Christopher Lehane has noted the similarities between the narratives of the film and the presidential campaign. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek argued that film was inspired by the French Revolution as portrayed by novelist Charles Dickens.

Trump had given the film a positive review in 2012. In 2019, Warner Bros. threatened legal action after Trump used the film's score for a 2020 campaign video without permission.

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston.

Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence: With the release of the song, Madonna brought the underground \"vogueing\" into mainstream culture. Before Madonna popularized the dance, vogue was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream.

South Korean singer Luna's song \"Madonna\" referenced \"Vogue\" on its lyrics, \"When I grow up, I wanna be like Madonna / When I grow up, I wanna vogue how I wanna\". The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death.

As well, the album received critical acclaim, and \"an exponentially increasing grassroots fan base that propelled her career forward in great leaps\". Her self-titled debut album, released in 2004, was the highest selling female solo debut album for the year, and attracted GMA nominations for both Female Vocalist and New Artist of the Year. The radio single All I Need reached the number one position on the U.S. charts. She released her second album, Imagination, in August 2005. The CD prompted CCM Magazine to label her as \"the future of Christian music\". Dillon appears on the Music Inspired by The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe soundtrack of 2005, singing \"Hero\".

When the Lord is growing something in me, it feels like a lot of things are dying\u2014because they really are. And when the Lord is making things soft and vulnerable in me, it's really painful. But even so, I think this is the freest sounding project I\u2019ve created.Joining Ed Cash in the co-production of Waking Up were Will Hunt and John Alagia . As CBN.com explains,Influenced for years by penetrating and poetic writers like Rich Mullins, Keith Green, and Sara Groves, Bethany has tended to gravitate toward themes that require a measure of courage and open-heartedness to explore... Waking Up embraces big questions of suffering, barrenness, vulnerability, romance, and faithfulness. Like the writers Bethany has modeled herself after, she proves herself willing to live and create in that place of ambivalent tension that inevitably comes from refusing to settle for easy, feel-good answers.

Bendis ultimately retained ownership of his creation, which allows him complete freedom as the writer. Bendis and Oeming were initially worried, after having produced but not solicited two issues of the series, to learn that writer Alan Moore was preparing what was to become Top 10 for America's Best Comics. Although the creators had been confident that the idea of a book juxtaposing superheroes and the police procedural had not been done previously, the knowledge that Moore was doing something similar nearly led them to abandon the series, before discovering that Top Ten featured superhero police officers and a different enough approach that led them to feel safe in continuing. Powers was initially previewed in a series of original strips which ran in Cliff Biggers and Ward Batty's Comic Shop News, a comics-industry periodical available from many comic shops. The eight strips were colored and lettered by Bendis and complemented the up-coming series as a companion piece in newspaper strip form. The strip was later serialized at the online comics magazine PopImage.com. Debuting with sales of 12,500 , Powers was faced with an uncertain future, as sales of comics tend to dwindle over subsequent issues. However, Image Comics publisher Jim Valentino and head of marketing Anthony Bozzi both read and enjoyed the first three issues , with Bozzi reportedly saying: \"If we can't make a book like POWERS sell we really should stop making comics\". Image offered to double-ship the second issue, effectively doubling the orders for that issue as an attempt to boost sales: the gamble worked, and issue #1 was soon reprinted, while according to Bendis, \"issues #3\u201311 saw an upswing\" in sales every issue. The reported Diamond pre-order figures show sales climbing above 23,000 by issue #7, and topping 30,000 with issue #14 and stabilizing between 25,000 and 30,000 for the remainder of the titles' Image run.  These strong sales allowed Oeming to quit his job as a security guard, while Bendis' launch of Ultimate Spider-Man had a positive effect on Powers sales as readers searched out his comics.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is covered in tropical forest, swamps, and grassland. The White Nile passes through the country, passing by Juba. South Sudan's protected area of Bandingilo National Park hosts the second-largest wildlife migration in the world. Surveys have revealed that Boma National Park, west of the Ethiopian border, as well as the Sudd wetland and Southern National Park near the border with Congo, provided habitat for large populations of hartebeest, kob, topi, buffalo, elephants, giraffes, and lions. South Sudan's forest reserves also provided habitat for bongo, giant forest hogs, red river hogs, forest elephants, chimpanzees, and forest monkeys. Surveys begun in 2005 by WCS in partnership with the semi-autonomous government of Southern Sudan revealed that significant, though diminished wildlife populations still exist, and that, astonishingly, the huge migration of 1.3\u00a0million antelopes in the southeast is substantially intact. Habitats in the country include grasslands, high-altitude plateaus and escarpments, wooded and grassy savannas, floodplains, and wetlands. Associated wildlife species include the endemic white-eared kob and Nile Lechwe, as well as elephants, giraffes, common eland, giant eland, oryx, lions, African wild dogs, cape buffalo, and topi . Little is known about the white-eared kob and tiang, both types of antelope, whose magnificent migrations were legendary before the civil war. The Boma-Jonglei Landscape region encompasses Boma National Park, broad pasturelands and floodplains, Bandingilo National Park, and the Sudd, a vast area of swamp and seasonally flooded grasslands that includes the Zeraf Wildlife Reserve. Little is known of the fungi of South Sudan. A list of fungi in Sudan was prepared by S. A. J. Tarr and published by the then Commonwealth Mycological Institute in 1955. The list, of 383 species in 175 genera, included all fungi observed within the then boundaries of the country. Many of those records relate to what is now South Sudan. Most of the species recorded were associated with diseases of crops. The true number of species of fungi in South Sudan is probably much higher. In 2006, President Kiir announced that his government would do everything possible to protect and propagate South Sudanese fauna and flora, and seek to reduce the effects of wildfires, waste dumping, and water pollution. The environment is threatened by the development of the economy and infrastructure. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 9.45/10, ranking it 4th globally out of 172 countries. Several ecoregions extend across South Sudan: the East Sudanian savanna, Northern Congolian forest\u2013savanna mosaic, Saharan flooded grasslands , Sahelian Acacia savanna, East African montane forests, and the Northern Acacia\u2013Commiphora bushlands and thickets.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Awaiting the return of her husband Menelaus for 17 years \u2014 the ten of the Trojan War and another seven for the search \u2014 Helen remains faithful to Menelaus and the promises she has made him: Helen made two oaths, one to the Spartan river Eurotas and another on the head of Menelaus himself as sanctifying object. Menelaus also swears fidelity to Helen: so seriously do husband and wife take their vows that they agree to commit suicide and never marry another if their plans fail. Such importance to oath-keeping is consonant with general practice during the time period . With these oaths, Helen and Menelaus declare their love for each other and their desire to live only with the other. These oaths prove their devotion and exemplify the importance of oaths. Given the play\u2019s humor and Euripides\u2019 general challenging of norms and values, it remains uncertain what our playwright\u2019s own views are. Identity and Reputation: Throughout all the different permutations of the story of Helen and the Trojan War, what makes the Trojan war distinctive is the fact that it is always caused, somehow, by Helen as the supreme embodiment of female beauty, whether she is or is not physically in Troy and whether she acts as an enthusiastic partner of Paris or as a reluctant victim of his unwanted rape. Euripides expands more on this idea by presenting his play largely from Helen\u2019s point of view, revealing how she truly feels about being the symbolic villain of the Trojan War. Helen\u2019s character in the play is deeply affected by the losses of the people who have died fighting to bring her back to her homeland and husband and expresses this guilt frequently: \u201cThe wrecked city of Ilium / is given up to the teeth of fire, / all through me and the deaths I caused, / all for my name of affliction\u201d . Despite this guilt, she also feels anger for being made into a symbol that people can project their hate on, even though they do not know her: \u201cI have done nothing wrong and yet my reputation / is bad, and worse than a true evil is it to bear / the burden of faults that are not truly yours\u201d . Although she spends a lot of the beginning of the play feeling pity for the men who have died and herself as well, Euripides\u2019 Helen is independent, confident, and intelligent. She displays her ability to think on her feet as she formulates a workable plan to return home and as she rejects her husband Menelaus\u2019 cockamamy plans.

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that West has been \"a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements\". Nieson elaborates, \"He is talented enough that he has made the calculation that you can dislike him and you will still listen to his music.\" Ed Ledsham from PopMatters said \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" Erik Nielson, a University of Richmond professor who teaches courses on hip-hop culture, opines that West is a \"mediocre rapper, but an extraordinary producer\". Nielson states, \"He will take a concept to an extreme, and flesh it out and explore it in some sort of depth,\" with a \"broad, eclectic range of sounds that he draws on that has opened up new possibilities for artists who came after him\". In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin described West as fronting a \"new art-pop era\" in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both extravagant wealth as well as creative exploration. Rolling Stone encapsulated West by calling him \"as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced\u2014a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture, and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up.\" AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact, \"As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century, West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold.\" West maintained a preppy fashion sense that helped expand hip-hop's definition of masculinity. Nielsen concedes that West \"definitely made it OK to be a little bit of a weirdo. He said when he came out that he wasn't a thug. He was the kid who went to school, his mom was a college professor. He definitely challenged some of the authenticity that had to be there at the moment.\" Rolling Stone credited West with transforming hip-hop's mainstream, \"establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap\", while Highsnobiety said his first three albums \u2013 \"a triumvirate of uber-successful records\" \u2013 \"cemented his role as a progressive rap progenitor\". West also has been credited with the commercial decline of the gangsta rap that once dominated mainstream hip-hop. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation marked a turning point in the music industry. With its emotive raps and confessional details, the album altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold to find wider mainstream acceptance. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to craft lyrical narratives about gunplay or drug-dealing. Rosie Swash of The Guardian deemed the sales competition a historical moment in hip-hop, because it \"highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.\" Billboard senior editor Alex Gale declared West \"absolutely one of the best, and you could make the argument for the best artist of the 21st century.\" Sharing similar sentiments, Complex called West the twenty-first century's \"most important artist of any art form, of any genre.\" The Atlantic writer David Samuels commented, \"Kanye's power resides in his wild creativity and expressiveness, his mastery of form, and his deep and uncompromising attachment to a self-made aesthetic that he expresses through means that are entirely of the moment: rap music, digital downloads, fashion, Twitter, blogs, live streaming video.\" Joe Muggs of The Guardian argued that \"there is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does [...] while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically.\" Drake, Nicki Minaj, Lil Uzi Vert and Casey Veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by West. He has been cited as a direct influence by artists and musical groups outside of hip-hop, including English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily Allen, R&B singer-songwriter Daniel Caesar, New Zealand pop artist Lorde and American electropop singer Halsey. Rock bands including Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, MGMT, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Fall Out Boy have cited West as an influence to their music. Experimental and electronic artists such as James Blake, Daniel Lopatin, and Tim Hecker have also cited West's work as an inspiration. Outside of his music career, West's success in the fashion industry has led to him being recognized as one of the most influential popular culture figures of his generation.

Several mentioned that it was only a loose adaptation of the novel, although the general consensus was that the essence of the original was maintained. Sam Wollaston in The Guardian stated \"Coming to it fresh, it's a neat story about aforementioned missing cat and time travel, with a smattering of quantum physics and the fundamental connectedness of things. With a lovely performance from Doreen Mantle as the old lady/murderer. Stephen Mangan's good in the title role, too \u2013 a teeny bit irritating perhaps, but then Mangan is a teeny bit irritating.

The result was a pleasingly festive-feeling adventure; part Wallace and Gromit, part Doctor Who, part The Secret Seven. And the best thing? There wasn't a Christmas tree in sight. Douglas Adams once claimed that Gently would make a better film character than his more famous hero, Arthur Dent. Based on last night's experience, he may well have been right.\" John Walsh's review for The Independent was cooler about the adaptation, although he praised Mangan's performance: \"Given the talent and style on display, it should have been a scream. In fact it all seemed a little moth-eaten. Though set in the modern day, it was staggeringly old-fashioned...You could overlook these faults, however, for the joy of Stephen Mangan's performance as the titular gumshoe.

It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock. It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock. Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues. Ireland's best selling musical act is the rock band U2, who have sold 170\u00a0million copies of their albums worldwide since their formation in 1976. There are a number of classical music ensembles around the country, such as the RT\u00c9 Performing Groups. Ireland also has two opera organisations: Irish National Opera in Dublin, and the annual Wexford Opera Festival, which promotes lesser-known operas, takes place during October and November. Ireland has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1965. Its first win was in 1970, when Dana won with All Kinds of Everything. It has subsequently won the competition six more times, the highest number of wins by any competing country. The phenomenon Riverdance originated as an interval performance during the 1994 contest. Irish dance can broadly be divided into social dance and performance dance. Irish social dance can be divided into c\u00e9il\u00ed and set dancing. Irish set dances are quadrilles, danced by 4 couples arranged in a square, while c\u00e9il\u00ed dances are danced by varied formations of couples of 2 to 16 people. There are also many stylistic differences between these two forms. Irish social dance is a living tradition, and variations in particular dances are found across the country. In some places dances are deliberately modified and new dances are choreographed. Performance dance is traditionally referred to as stepdance. Irish stepdance, popularised by the show Riverdance, is notable for its rapid leg movements, with the body and arms being kept largely stationary. The solo stepdance is generally characterised by a controlled but not rigid upper body, straight arms, and quick, precise movements of the feet.

It is the eighth film in the Star Trek film series, the second to star the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the film, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E travel back in time from the 24th century to the mid-21st century to stop the cybernetic Borg from conquering Earth by changing their past. After the release of Star Trek Generations in 1994, Paramount Pictures tasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with developing the next film in the series. Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot, while producer Rick Berman wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period that the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century, after fearing the Renaissance idea would be \"too kitsch\". After two better-known directors turned down the job, cast member Jonathan Frakes was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone who understood Star Trek. The film's script required the creation of new starship designs, including a new USS Enterprise. Production designer Herman Zimmerman and illustrator John Eaves collaborated to make a sleeker ship than its predecessor. Principal photography began with weeks of location shooting in Arizona and California, before production moved to new sets for the ship-based scenes. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as their appearances on the television series. Effects company Industrial Light & Magic rushed to complete the film's special effects in less than five months. Traditional optical effects techniques were supplemented with computer-generated imagery.

It eventually made $92 million in the United States and Canada with an additional $54 million in other territories, combining to a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it to be one of the best Star Trek films, and it was the most positively reviewed film in the franchise until being marginally surpassed by the 2009 reboot film. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean-Luc Picard's parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab and the nature of the Borg. First Contact was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup and won three Saturn Awards. It was followed by Star Trek: Insurrection in 1998.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hill and Baldwin were friendly \u2013 at one stage they were going to make The Fugitive together before being replaced by Andrew Davis and Harrison Ford.

Hill was going to direct with Baldwin starring, then, according to Baldwin, \"they got into a hassle about the budget and Walter split to go do Geronimo, and he gave everybody his blessing to go do it without him.\" Producer David Foster approached Roger Donaldson to direct in Hill's place. Donaldson originally said no as he did not want to do a remake. Then he read the script \"and I really liked it,\" said Donaldson. \"And then I rented the original movie, which I'd never seen, and I liked that, too. I saw how I could put my own stamp on it. There were lots of things about it that appealed to me: I love the Southwest, I love the genre of the road movie, I love a thriller and I like the sort of underlying conflicts of the relationships in that movie.\" Baldwin said he \"always wanted to do a movie that required what I consider to be movie acting, which is that it's not what you do, but what you don't do. It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that. There's always a steady flow of action films \u2013 it's the most mined material \u2013 but what distinguishes an action movie is the acting.\" Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had fallen in love while making The Marrying Man together and he asked her to play the female role. Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status. But my first reaction to Alec's suggestion was no.\" She went back to the original Jim Thompson novel to see if there was a more substantial theme to the story. I saw that this theme could be summed up in one word \u2013 trust.... And I said to Alec, \"See what we have here. This is all about trust. These two people can't trust anybody or anything. They can't trust their colleagues. They seemingly can't trust each other.

Basinger: There's something going on between us here that was never developed between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw [sic]. The movie asks all sorts of questions about our relationship. I'd said to Alec that if we did this together, I wanted it to be more of a partnership movie than the first. I wanted to see where that aspect went, with the movie being more about the relationship and the violence running second \u2013 although there's plenty of that in the movie... Let's not kid ourselves. This movie is made for a commercial audience. It's a very difficult question for me because I don't like violence.

However, material since Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene. In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\" Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones. Due to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned post-metal, hardcore punk, and doom metal, some have described Isis as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore. Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

According to Hoffenberg, Terry Southern and I wrote Candy for the money.  Olympia Press, $500 flat.  He was in Switzerland, I was in Paris.  We did it in letters.  But when it got to be a big deal in the States, everybody was taking it seriously.  Do you remember what kind of shit people were saying?  One guy wrote a review about how Candy was a satire on Candide.  So right away I went back and reread Voltaire to see if he was right.  That's what happens to you.  It's as if you vomit in the gutter and everybody starts saying it's the greatest new art form, so you go back to see it, and, by God, you have to agree. Southern had a different take on the novel's genesis, claiming it was  based on a short story he had written about a girl living in New York's Greenwich Village neighborhood, a Good Samaritan-type, who became involved with a hunchback. After he read Southern's story in manuscript form, Hoffenberg suggested the character should have more adventures. Southern suggested that Hoffenberg write a story about the girl, and he came up with the chapter in which Candy meets Dr. Krankheit at the hospital. He wrote that and I began to write other chapters. Every once in a while, I would show him what I wrote. It was like telling jokes back and forth. Your hearing of the joke becomes as important as telling the joke. In that sense, it was such a good thing because there was this built-in obligation to write the next chapter. It was like returning a good favor. That approach worked quite well and was in perfect sync with the kind of creative work that people try to do together. They finished the book in the commune of Tourrettes-sur-Loup France, in a cottage that Southern's friend Mordecai Richler rented for them. Southern and Hoffenberg battled Olympia Press publisher Maurice Girodias over the story's copyright after the book was published in North America by Putnam under the authors' own names and became a best-seller. In 2006, Playboy Magazine listed Candy among the \"25 Sexiest Novels Ever Written\", and described the story as a \"young heroine's picaresque travels, a kind of sexual pinball machine that lights up academia, gardeners, the medical profession, mystics and bohemians.\" The novel was made into a film by Christian Marquand in 1968 as Candy. Several of the items depicted in this book were included by director Gail Palmer in the 1978 adult film The Erotic Adventures of Candy whose opening credits state it is based on Voltaire's Candide.

Nick Crawford, Jeff Fedel, Dennis Dejnowski, and Kalen Bigg arrived from Nemonic, and Brandon Whalen arrived from Arms Over Colorado. The bands decided to join forces after Nick Crawford and Jeff Fedel of Nemonic expressed displeasure with their lead singer at the time. Brandon Whalen offered to join the band as the lead vocalist. The band's name \"My Body Sings Electric\" was derived from the poem Sing the Body Electric by Walt Whitman. The band was driven by a common love for bands like the Sound Of Animals Fighting and the Mars Volta. Original bassist Dennis Dejnowski left the band in summer 2008 and was replaced with current bassist Jason Bower. My Body Sings Electric released their first self-produced EP, They Don't Want Music, in 2008. Though the album was praised for \"admirable instrumentation\" and \"lyrical ambition,\" it was criticized for its \"spaced-out noodling\" and a lack of discipline. Warped Tour Appearance In Summer 2009, My Body Sings Electric was selected by Ernie Ball to play the Denver stop of Warped Tour 2009 at Invesco field at Mile High. The band was elated for an opportunity to play at the festival. Lead singer Brandon Whalen was quoted as saying, \"To a lot of people, just seeing our name associated with a big tour like Warped Tour sort of legitimizes what we are doing.\" A Shift in Musical Focus and Member Changes Late in 2009, the band began writing songs for a full-length album to be recorded in 2010. Having grown weary of playing heavy music, and having grown bored with the direction of hardcore in the Denver music scene, the band decided to change their musical style and concentrate on writing catchy, pop music with indie rock and punk rock influences. In early 2010, drummer Kalen Bigg left the band. Ben Scarboro, of Denver hardcore band The Skyline Surrender took over the drumming duties. Changing Color In November 2010, My Body Sings Electric traveled to Portland, Oregon to record at Interlace Audio. The members were huge fans of many albums recorded at Interlace, including records from Dance Gavin Dance, Fear Before, and Closure In Moscow. The production quality of the album was an improvement over \"They Don't Want Music\" and enhanced the band's new pop-sensible sound. Stephan Hawkes produced, engineered, recorded, mixed, and mastered the album. \"Changing Color\" was scheduled to be released in early April 2011. In April 2011, My Body Sings Electric released \u201cChanging Color\u201d to a two-night run of sold out shows at The Bluebird with friends in The Epilogues and Input. The long list of shows in 2011 included a date at Red Rocks Amphitheater. In late 2011 the band embarked on a west coast tour named, \"Terminatour 2011\" through Billings, Bremerton, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In the beginning of 2012, bassist Jason Bower took a leave of absence for personal reasons. Unwilling to slow the pace, the band pressed on with close friend Marshall Gallagher on bass duties. The year would include a main stage performance at Westword Music Showcase with Churchill, Macklemore and Girl Talk along with a trip to Austin for SXSW 2012, and another west coast tour through Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and Idaho. In the spring of 2012, Changing Color cracked the top 200 on the CMJ charts and the band inked licensing agreements with 17 national TV networks including Showtime, MTV, Bravo, Fox Sports and Discovery Networks.

Stokes said the song, both upon initial and repeated listens, \"seems transcendent, a magnificent synthesis of elements, words and music, rhythm, instrumentation arrangement and intonation combine to create something that speaks a language beyond logic, the definitive language of emotional truth\". He said the melody was reminiscent of Led Zeppelin and the vocals evoked memories of Al Green and the Rolling Stones circa \"Sympathy for the Devil\".

Its author, Stephen King, was already at that time a best-selling author who, after the blockbuster of Carrie, could boast of successes in adaptations for the big screen. For his part, Kubrick had been considering directing a horror film for some time; a few years before, while Barry Lyndon disappointed at the box office, another Warner film he had refused to direct, The Exorcist, directed by William Friedkin, was breaking box office records around the world. Asked what it was that attracted Kubrick to the idea of adapting the novel by the popular writer, a regular on the best-seller lists, his executive producer Jan Harlan revealed that Kubrick wanted to \"try\" in this film genre, although with the condition of being able to change King's novel. And that condition would finally be guaranteed by contract. The script was written by the director himself with the collaboration of the writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had rejected the initial version of the draft, written by King himself, as too literal an adaptation of the novel. Furthermore, the filmmaker did not believe in ghost stories because that \"would imply the possibility that there was something after death\", and he did not believe there was anything, \"not even hell.\" Instead, Johnson, who was teaching a Gothic novel seminar at the University of California at Berkeley at the time, seemed like a better fit for the project. Deep down, Johnson looked down on Stephen King's literature; shortly after the premiere, in an interview with the Parisian magazine Positiv, she stated: Among us, The Shining is not part of great literature. It is scary, it is effective and it works, without further ado . But it is precisely interesting to see how a very bad book can also be very effective. It's quite pretentious. But it is also true that one has less scruples when destroying it: one is aware that a great work of art is not being destroyed. Kubrick, for his part, was more enthusiastic about the possibilities of the manuscript: It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation. I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Gaiman paid tribute to Bradbury's influence on him and many of his peers in a 2012 The Guardian article following Bradbury's death.  Gaiman's novel American Gods can be read as a tribute to and attempt to surpass many of the \"dark carnival\" themes in Bradbury's work.  The motif of ordinary people up against sinister, supernatural forces appears in many of King's works, including It and Dreamcatcher. King also discusses this novel at length in his 1981 non-fiction book Danse Macabre. The book also influenced R. L. Stine, who said, \"Ray Bradbury is one of my favorite authors.

She dresses in her maid's outfit and explores the world outside their apartment with wonder. Eventually she takes a job in a video store and becomes romantically involved with one of the employees, Junichi. When she accidentally cuts herself and deflates, Junichi repairs the tear with adhesive tape and re-inflates her.

S.H.E's other contributions include songs in the soundtracks of Magical Love, The Rose, Reaching for the Stars, Tokyo Juliet, The Little Fairy, Hanazakarino Kimitachihe, and Bull Fighting. In 2008, they sang the ending theme for the film CJ7. The group is also known for harmonizing between each other, but has no designated lead singer and has no leader. All three members have different vocal ranges to complement each other. Ella sings within the alto to mezzo-soprano range, while Hebe and Selina sing within the mezzo-soprano to soprano range, with Ella having the widest vocal range of the three. Most S.H.E songs fall into the category of pop music. Songs from this genre consist of light melodies, simple drum beats, and the occasional piano or synthesizer accompaniment. In Girls Dorm and Youth Society, acoustic guitar melody lines were used as well. While some slower songs, particularly those in Genesis, fall into the genre of R&B, high-tempo songs, such as \"Beauty Up My Life\", focus more on techno. S.H.E has also sung a few pop/rock songs, including \"Piquancy\" , \"Super Star\", and \"Star Light\" . As their career progressed, S.H.E began mixing light-hearted pop ballads with elements of hip hop and dance.

But when she rushes to tell him, she finds that he has committed suicide by hanging himself with an Internet cable. Mattie and her friends begin to receive online messages from Josh asking for help, but assume that Josh's computer is still on and that a virus is creating the messages. Mattie learns that Josh's computer has been sold to Dex McCarthy , who finds a number of strange videos on the computer. Mattie receives a package that Josh mailed two days prior to his death.

Later, Dex visits Mattie and shows her video messages that Josh was sending to Ziegler. Josh had hacked Ziegler's computer system and then distributed a virus. This virus had unlocked a portal that connected the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. Josh believed that he had coded a counter to the virus and wanted to meet Ziegler at the library.

Robby Krieger used a guitar tuning which he had learned from Ravi Shankar's music lessons at the Kinnara School of Music in Los Angeles, to create a sitar or veena sound; this enhances the raga rock mood.

They told Schwartz they wanted to create a television show based in McG's hometown of Newport Beach, Orange County, California. Savage suggested producing a police or extreme sports 21 Jump Street-style show, but Schwartz knew little about the genre. Having had experiences with people from Newport Beach during his time at the University of Southern California, Schwartz came back to them with his own characters. The show was pitched to Fox in August 2002. Fox targeted a summer launch for the show, and Doug Liman was brought in to direct the premiere after McG withdrew due to his scheduling conflicts with Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. The show was confirmed for the 2003\u20132004 schedule in May, and an August 5, 2003 broadcast date was selected in June. Schwartz said that inspiration for the show came from being a fan of Larry Sanders, Cameron Crowe and other \"quirky character-driven shows like Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared, and My So-Called Life\". Schwartz went to college at the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television, and later said that The O.C. was \"very much based on sort of the experiences I had when I was in college\" as a \"Jewish kid from the East Coast ... surrounded by all these kids from Newport Beach who were water-polo players, and these very blonde girls who only wanted to date them. I felt very much like an outsider.\" Although Orange County residents criticized the show's title, stating that people did not call the county by the phrase, Schwartz claims that USC students did say that they were from \"The O.C.\" He also stated that Cohen family in season one resembles his own family life, adding that \"The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my dad.\" Schwartz reasoned that, \"As much as our audience enjoys living vicariously in this wealthy world, I think the true wish fulfillment comes from wishing that they had a family like the Cohens\u00a0\u2014 where the parents could be that cool and that grounded and that loving, but also real parents.\" Schwartz said that he wrote the highly regarded Pilot episode in his boxer shorts. \"I had no idea what would come of it and there was just that purity to it.\" The script for the Pilot attracted most of the regular cast to the project, including film star Peter Gallagher, who said of the Pilot, \"In that recently post-9/11 America, I read this script and thought it was astounding.

[..] they don't lose their sense of humor or their inclination to help. They still open their arms and embrace this outsider kid. And I thought that was powerful in an era with a kind of xenophobia, a kind of looking-over-your-shoulder and getting small and angry, sort of creeping into the PATRIOT Act-fueled environment.

Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel. So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others. What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should. Mark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks. Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little\". King never hid his rejection of the final result of the film project, and accused Kubrick of not understanding the rules of the horror genre. King was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired the story . However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled The Shining, filmed at The Stanley Hotel. The animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the Bravo channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\". Nonetheless, writing in the afterword of Doctor Sleep, King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it \"...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember\u00a0\u2013 for reasons I have never quite understood\u00a0\u2013 as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.\" Mike Flanagan, director of the film adaptation of Doctor Sleep, would reconcile the differences between novel and film versions of The Shining there. Doctor Sleep is a direct adaptation of its novel counterpart, which itself is a sequel to the novel version of The Shining, but is also a continuation of Kubrick's film; in explaining the latter, Flanagan expressed, \"The Shining is so ubiquitous and has burned itself into the collective imagination of people who love cinema in a way that so few movies have. There\u2019s no other language to tell that story in. If you say \u2018Overlook Hotel,\u2019 I see something. It lives right up in my brain because of Stanley Kubrick. You can't pretend that isn't the case\". King initially rejected Flanagan's pitch of bringing back the Overlook as seen in Kubrick's film, but changed his mind after Flanagan pitched a scene within the hotel towards the end of the film that served as his reason to bring back the Overlook. Upon reading the script, King was so satisfied with the result that he said, \"Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version of The Shining is redeemed for me here.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1576", "question": "What genre is Close to Home?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It's all about small, and less and less. An action film is a perfect opportunity for that.

Basinger said she \"loved\" the original movie \"a lot. It had this cult status.

Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.

The album showed more of a hard rock side of Metallica than the band's typical thrash metal style, which alienated much of the band's fanbase. It also featured influences from genres such as Southern rock, blues rock, country rock, and alternative rock. Drummer Lars Ulrich said about Load more exploratory nature, \"This album and what we're doing with it \u2013 that, to me, is what Metallica are all about: exploring different things.

At 79 minutes, Load is Metallica's longest studio album. Load received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, debuting and spending four consecutive weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. Load sold 680,000 units in its first week, making it the biggest opening week for Metallica as well as the biggest debut of 1996.

He had clearly started work by 25 August, writing to a friend, \"If this don't fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my day. Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the Admiral Benbow public house on the [Devon] coast, that it's all about a map and a treasure and a mutiny and a derelict ship... It's quite silly and horrid fun \u2013 and what I want is the best book about Buccaneers that can be had\". Stevenson originally gave the book the title The Sea Cook. One month after conceiving of the book, chapters began to appear in the pages of the Young Folks magazine. After completing fifteen or nineteen chapters rapidly, Stevenson was interrupted by illness; he left Scotland and continued working on the first draft near London, where he and his father discussed points of the tale, and his father suggested elements that he included. The novel eventually ran in seventeen weekly instalments from October 1, 1881, to January 28, 1882. The book was later republished as the novel Treasure Island and proved to be Stevenson's first financial and critical success. The Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who served four terms as British Prime Minister between 1868 and 1894, was one of the book's biggest fans. Two general types of sea novels were popular during the 19th century: the navy yarn, which places a capable officer in adventurous situations amid realistic settings and historical events, and the desert island romance, which features shipwrecked or marooned characters confronted by treasure-seeking pirates or angry natives. Around 1815, the latter genre became one of the most popular fictional styles in Great Britain, perhaps because of the philosophical interest in Rousseau and Chateaubriand's \"noble savage\". Treasure Island was a climax of this development. The growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to 1719 when Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe was published. A century later, novels such as S. H. Burney's The Shipwreck , and Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate continued to expand upon Defoe's classic. Other authors, in the mid-19th century, continued this trend, with works including James Fenimore Cooper's The Pilot . During the same period, Edgar Allan Poe wrote, \"MS Found in a Bottle\" and \"The Gold-Bug\" . All of these works influenced Stevenson's end product. Stevenson also consciously borrowed material from previous authors. In a July 1884 letter to Sidney Colvin, he wrote that \"Treasure Island came out of Kingsley's At Last, where I got the Dead Man's Chest\u2014and that was the seed\u2014and out of the great Captain Johnson's History of the Notorious Pirates\". Stevenson also admits that he took the idea of Captain Flint's pointing skeleton from Poe's The Gold-Bug and he constructed Billy Bones' history from the \"Money-Diggers\" section of Tales of a Traveller by Washington Irving, one of his favorite writers. Half of Stevenson's manuscripts are lost, including those of Treasure Island, The Black Arrow, and The Master of Ballantrae. Stevenson's heirs sold his papers during World War I; many of his documents were auctioned off in 1918.", "hasanswer": false}]}

An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000. Shubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis. The actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence. Three scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K. Dick's \"Impostor\" and Clifford D.

It is the first entry in the Mother series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to fight hostile, formerly inanimate objects and other enemies. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system. Writer and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mothers concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released worldwide under the name EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022. Mother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes; however, many considered its sequel EarthBound to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues.

{"id": "91_1590", "question": "What genre is Between God?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_36005", "text": "The four canonical gospels are the foremost sources for the life and message of Jesus. But other parts of the New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26. Acts of the Apostles refers to Jesus' early ministry and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1-11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the Gospels, Jesus' words or instructions are cited several times. Some early Christian groups had separate descriptions of Jesus' life and teachings that are not in the New Testament. These include the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these were written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels. The canonical gospels are four accounts, each by a different author. The authors of the Gospels are all anonymous, attributed by tradition to the four evangelists, each with close ties to Jesus: Mark by John Mark, an associate of Peter; Matthew by one of Jesus' disciples; Luke by a companion of Paul mentioned in a few epistles; and John by another of Jesus' disciples, the \"beloved disciple\". One important aspect of the study of the Gospels is the literary genre under which they fall. Genre \"is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings\". Whether the gospel authors set out to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted. Some recent studies suggest that the genre of the Gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient biography. Although not without critics, the position that the Gospels are a type of ancient biography is the consensus among scholars today. Concerning the accuracy of the accounts, viewpoints run the gamut from considering them inerrant descriptions of Jesus' life, to doubting whether they are historically reliable on a number of points, to considering them to provide very little historical information about his life beyond the basics. According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels are the most reliable sources of information about Jesus. According to the Marcan priority, the first to be written was the Gospel of Mark , followed by the Gospel of Matthew , the Gospel of Luke , and the Gospel of John . Most scholars agree that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source for their gospels. Since Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark, many scholars assume that they used another source in addition to Mark. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the Synoptic Gospels, from the Greek \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd and \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 , because they are similar in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure, and one can easily set them next to each other and synoptically compare what is in them. Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John. While the flow of some events are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in John, which also differs on other matters, such as the Cleansing of the Temple. The Synoptics emphasize different aspects of Jesus. In Mark, Jesus is the Son of God whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of God's Kingdom. He is a tireless wonder worker, the servant of both God and man. This short gospel records few of Jesus' words or teachings. The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes that Jesus is the fulfillment of God's will as revealed in the Old Testament, and the Lord of the Church. He is the \"Son of David\", a \"king\", and the messiah. Luke presents Jesus as the divine-human savior who shows compassion to the needy. He is the friend of sinners and outcasts, come to seek and save the lost. This gospel includes well-known parables, such as the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. The prologue to the Gospel of John identifies Jesus as an incarnation of the divine Word . As the Word, Jesus was eternally present with God, active in all creation, and the source of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more. In general, the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in John 21:25, the Gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in Jesus' life. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of Jesus' life in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. The Gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, but it is possible to draw from them a general picture of Jesus' life story.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ulvaeus mentioned in retrospect that the sessions were troubled, noting, \"It could be frosty sometimes.\" Lyngstad also commented that they were beginning to tire of working together. The members of ABBA and their personnel have memories of the recording sessions for this album being rather difficult. To begin with, their sound engineer Michael Tretow had to become accustomed to using the new 32-track digital recorder that had been purchased for Polar Music Studios. He said, \"Digital recording...cut out all the hiss, but it also meant that sounds were sharply cut off below a certain level. The sound simply became too clean, so I had to find ways of compensating for that.\"  The first three tracks for the album had already been recorded using analogue tape and therefore Tretow had to transfer all subsequent tracks from digital to analogue and back again to avoid a difference in quality.

{"id": "91_1594", "question": "What genre is Cross?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27179", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple , as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona , without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film\". Their third film, Miller's Crossing , reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire. This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink ; the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre\". Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s\". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision\". Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material\". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours , a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains\". Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest . StyleBarton Fink uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to \"plumb the depths\" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements\u00a0\u2013  combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence\u00a0\u2013  create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that \"the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling\". The style of Barton Fink is also evocative\u00a0\u2013 and representative\u00a0\u2013 of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: \"Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties.\" The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II film-making. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero Jack Oakie. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in Barton Fink represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century. From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's subjective view of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera tilts down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene. The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: film-making. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton , not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: \"[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another.\u00a0... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist and the world outside it \". The film also employs numerous foreshadowing techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word \"head\" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his \"job\" of selling insurance: \"Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He gained renown at first as a virtuoso guitarist and composer for the instrument. When he attempted composing operas, however, he was rejected by the French. His Op. 7 was a large and strange piece, notated in three clefs, and no guitarist at the time could play it. Since France was no longer supportive of his music, Sor decided to try his talents elsewhere. In 1815, he went to London to attempt to build a stronger music career there. Again, he gained considerable fame as a classical guitarist and gave guitar and voice lessons. Since ballet in London was more popular than opera, Sor decided to try his hand at this new genre of music. He had considerable success this time, especially with his ballet Cendrillon. By 1823, once he had acquired a level of fame in London, Sor again wandered away, this time with the ballerina F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Hullin to Moscow in her quest to become a prima ballerina. Not much is known about his time there, however, despite the exaggeration about his romantic and professional life. After three years in Moscow, he traveled around Europe giving concerts and getting into music circles everywhere he went. In 1827, partly due to his advancing age, he settled down and decided to live out the rest of his life back in Paris. It was during this retirement that he composed the majority of his classical guitar works. He had to comply with the demands of the public, though, and most guitarists wanted technically simple, nice-sounding pieces. It was in these last ten or so years of his life that his writings reveal his bitterness towards how his publications were being received by the public. For example, Op. 43 is entitled Mes Ennuis , and six of his ballets are dedicated to \"whoever wants them\". These and other caustic remarks did not help his sales in the least. The foreword to Op. 45 goes even further than sarcasm: \"Let's see if that's that. Six short and easy pieces in stages, which aim to lead to what has generally been agreed are difficulties. Composed and dedicated to the person with the least patience, by Fernando Sor. Opus 45.\" His last work was a mass in honour of his daughter, who died in 1837.

The documentary centers on the fate of Mitnick, who is claimed to have been misrepresented in the feature film Takedown produced by Miramax and adapted from the book by the same name by Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff, which is based on disputed events. The film also documents a number of computer enthusiasts who drive across the United States searching for Miramax representatives and demonstrating their discontent with certain aspects of the bootleg script of Takedown they had acquired. One of their major points of criticism was that the script ended with Mitnick being convicted to serve a long-term prison sentence, while in reality, at the time the film's production, Mitnick had not yet even had a trial but nonetheless was incarcerated for five years without bail in a high-security facility. Freedom Downtime also touches on what happened to other hackers after being sentenced. The development of the Free Kevin movement is also covered. Several notable and iconic figures from the hacking community appear in the movie, including Phiber Optik , Bernie S , Alex Kasper, and director Emmanuel Goldstein . Freedom Downtime tries to communicate a different view of the hacker community from that usually shown by the mainstream media, with hackers being depicted as curious people who rarely intend to cause damage, driven by a desire to explore and conduct pranks. The film questions the rationality of placing computer hackers who went \"over the line\" in the same environment as serious felons. It also contains interviews with people related to Mitnick and hacker culture in general. The authors of , ex-couple Katie Hafner and John Markoff, appear in very different roles. While Hafner's empathy for Mitnick is shown to have grown, Markoff continues to defend his critical book and articles in The New York Times newspaper about the hacker. Markoff is ridiculed as the narrator, director Goldstein , points out his factual errors during the interview. Reba Vartanian, Mitnick's grandmother, also appears in a number of interview segments. Furthermore, lawyers, friends, and libertarians give their view of the story. Footage and interviews from the DEF CON and Hackers on Planet Earth conventions try to dispel some hacker myths and confirm others. The film premiered at H2K, the 2000 H.O.P.E. convention.  After that the film saw a limited independent theatrical release and was shown at film festivals.  It was released on VHS and sold via the 2600 website. In June 2004, a DVD was released.

The woman notes that the sea is rising. After construction is completed, and after temporarily stopping the sea from eroding the castle away, the two decide to go on a journey to discover the cause behind the rising sea level. As they leave, the frames slowly fade to white, as the rising water begins to destroy the castle. The two journey out, finding a river that they were unaware of; the couple follow the river and make observations as they go. While resting under a tree, the man finds the remains of a campsite, discovering that the area they were in had been inhabited. Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like. They climb up and eventually reach a small abandoned house. While there, the man is attacked by a big cat, which the woman routs with a piece of wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. They decide that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain would be a better medical option than heading back home, so they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time-lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people. They find a small structure, and from its top the woman spots people. As they leave the structure, they think of their sand castle, wondering about its fate. The screen cuts to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then cuts back. After more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon the man and woman to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs them that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest along the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and there is a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader who, speaking the language of the protagonists to some extent, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls \"the planet's mightiest river\" at bay, which is days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they have no choice but to remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen. Upon returning home, the two characters attempt to coordinate an escape with their own people.

Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was \"the kind of character you rarely see anymore  he was a man with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it\". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood. Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen. He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \"a very tricky structure\" for a feature film. A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008, with Neil Marshall set to direct what was being described as \"an L.A.-set action mystery\", planned as a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman. Universal Studios, which had tried to make a film version for some time, was also on board. By February 2010, Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project. Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: \"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me  writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \"very strong character\" at its core, and a \"powerful\" romance. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said: I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft  maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. When Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. The actor chose Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, whose work he admired. He said, \"It had to be [him]. There was no other choice.\" When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive, he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the plot of the story. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script, as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about whether Refn wanted to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The majority of scholars consider the compilation of these books to go back to the Persian period, 538\u2013332\u00a0BCE, but based on earlier written and oral traditions. There is a wealth of stories and additional information about Moses in the Jewish apocrypha and in the genre of rabbinical exegesis known as Midrash, as well as in the primary works of the Jewish oral law, the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition. The Midrash identifies Moses as one of seven biblical personalities who were called by various names. Moses's other names were Jekuthiel , Heber , Jered , Avi Zanoah , Avi Gedor , Avi Soco , Shemaiah ben Nethanel . Moses is also attributed the names Toviah , and Levi , Heman, Mechoqeiq and Ehl Gav Ish . In another exegesis, Moses had ascended to the first heaven until the seventh, even visited Paradise and Hell alive, after he saw the Divine vision in Mount Horeb. Jewish historians who lived at Alexandria, such as Eupolemus, attributed to Moses the feat of having taught the Phoenicians their alphabet, similar to legends of Thoth. Artapanus of Alexandria explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/Hermes, but also with the Greek figure Musaeus , and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres. Jewish tradition considers Moses to be the greatest prophet who ever lived.

{"id": "91_1609", "question": "What genre is On Tour?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24563", "text": "As the \"first true megamusical\", Cats pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals\u00a0\u2014 including Les Mis\u00e9rables , The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon \u2014 that have dominated the industry since. Siropoulos explained: Cats introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional pull quotes or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting\u00a0\u2014 and then aggressively promoting\u00a0\u2014 a single recognisable image as the face of the show. The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history, and was paired with a tagline to create what The Daily Telegraph called \"one of musical theatre's greatest posters\". Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif Cosette for Les Mis\u00e9rables and the Phantom's mask for The Phantom of the Opera. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called \"critic-proof\" status of megamusicals. Additionally, Cats was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official Cats t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry. Beyond the megamusical, Cats also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the Disney Theatrical Productions and jukebox musicals. The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry. Composer Joe Raposo said of family musicals in 1986: \"Cats is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped. People do want a theatrical experience for their children.\" Thanks to its easily accessible spectacle, the original Broadway production also tapped into the then-burgeoning tourist boom in New York and its audience shifted increasingly towards foreign visitors in its later years. Billington also specifically traces the rise of the jukebox musical genre back to Cats, citing the latter's disregard for dramatic text in favour of an all-encompassing theatrical experience. The musical's fantasy setting and disregard for verisimilitude allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured David Hersey's pioneering use of automated lighting to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an \"architectural manner\", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of fast cutting in film editing. The original London production of Cats was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with radio microphones. The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre. This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre. Cats opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on. Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation. Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote: In the 1980s, the success of local productions of Cats in Tokyo, Sydney, Vienna, Hamburg, and Toronto were turning points that established these cities as major commercial markets in the global theatrical circuit. The musical was also a boon for the Broadway touring industry. In 1997, The New York Times credited the regional and touring productions of Cats with \"almost single-handedly reviv[ing] the sagging road business\". Cats revolutionised the touring business by introducing the now commonplace practice of extended touring engagements that can last several weeks or months in a single city, as opposed to the typical one-week or ten-day tour stop. Mackintosh's insistence that all touring productions of Cats replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical's demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Initially amateur artists dominated the group, and Bird's closest friends included the amateurs John King, who was also Bird's doctor, and George Cumberland. Cumberland, who moved to Bristol in 1807, became godfather to Bird's son. He had a large art collection from which he would lend items for Bird to study. The group conducted evening sketching meetings and sketching excursions to scenic locations around Bristol. Landscape with Cottage was probably painted on one of these trips. However, Bird painted landscapes relatively infrequently and he would often accompany the excursions without joining in the sketching. Bird's greatest influence on the Bristol artists was in the naturalistic style and fresh colours of his genre painting, especially so in the case of Rippingille, who worked closely with him. In 1814 they both exhibited works at the Royal Academy with the same subject, The Cheat Detected. Francis Danby, who moved to Bristol from Ireland in 1813 and was to succeed Bird as a leader of the Bristol School, was also influenced by Bird's genre style.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly: NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two\u00a0hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the series's cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2\u00a0million for 30\u00a0seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the Seinfeld finale at $1.7\u00a0million. In the U.S., 52.5\u00a0million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998. Although not the most-watched episode of the series, the finale was the fourth\u00a0most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of M*A*S*H, Cheers and Seinfeld, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4 and 76.2\u00a0million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36\u00a0million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of Friends and Frasier, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Expressed opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In Persian ghazals he used his pen-name, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of Hasanoghlu. Classical literature in Azerbaijani was formed in the 14th century based on the various Early Middle Ages dialects of Tabriz and Shirvan. Among the poets of this period were Gazi Burhanaddin, Haqiqi , and Habibi. The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of Imadaddin Nasimi, one of the greatest Turkic Hurufi mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early divan masters in Turkic literary history, who also composed poetry in Persian and Arabic. The divan and ghazal styles were further developed by poets Qasem-e Anvar, Fuzuli and Khatai . The Book of Dede Korkut consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century, and was not written earlier than the 15th century. It is a collection of 12 stories reflecting the oral tradition of Oghuz nomads. The 16th-century poet, Muhammed Fuzuli produced his timeless philosophical and lyrical Qazals in Arabic, Persian, and Azerbaijani. Benefiting immensely from the fine literary traditions of his environment, and building upon the legacy of his predecessors, Fuzuli was destined to become the leading literary figure of his society. His major works include The Divan of Ghazals and The Qasidas. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of Ashik poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khat\u0101\u012b Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani, which were later published as his Divan. A unique literary style known as qoshma was introduced in this period, and developed by Shah Ismail and later by his son and successor, Shah Tahmasp I. In the span of the 17th and 18th centuries, Fuzuli's unique genres as well Ashik poetry were taken up by prominent poets and writers such as Qovsi of Tabriz, Shah Abbas Sani, Agha Mesih Shirvani, Nishat, Molla Vali Vidadi, Molla Panah Vagif, Amani, Zafar and others. Along with Turks, Turkmens and Uzbeks, Azerbaijanis also celebrate the Epic of Koroglu , a legendary folk hero. Several documented versions of Koroglu epic remain at the Institute for Manuscripts of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan. Modern Azerbaijani literature in Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iran it is based on the Tabrizi one. The first newspaper in Azerbaijani, Akinchi was published in 1875. In the mid-19th century, it was taught in the schools of Baku, Ganja, Shaki, Tbilisi, and Yerevan. Since 1845, it was also taught in the University of Saint Petersburg in Russia.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Various sidemen throughout the years included JayDee Maness, Wayne \"Moose\" Stone, Jay McDonald, Ken Presley, and very early on, Merle Haggard. Haggard, who worked a short time with Owens in 1962, suggested the group's name. Fiddle player Jana Jae became the group's first female member after being invited onstage with Buck Owens to play \"Orange Blossom Special\". Vocalist Victoria Hallman toured with the Buckaroos, sang with them on Hee Haw and recorded one Buck Owens record \"Let Jesse Rob the Train\" with the group. Drummer/singer Rick Taylor replaced Jerry Wiggins in 1978, when he left the band to manage his wife, Susan Raye. Rick performed his first appearance at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas \"winging it\" as there was no time for rehearsals before the sold-out performances. Rick had seen Buck and the original Buckaroos live in Omaha when he was 13 years old and dreamed of performing with Buck on Hee Haw. At age 19 he made his way to Nashville and 5 years later, he was performing in a rock cover group at a Nashville night club when Buck himself came to watch him at the urging of Hee Haw music director, Charlie McCoy, and Hee Haw staff band players, Leon Rhodes, and Tommy Williams. Buck hired Rick on the spot and invited him to the Hee Haw set the next day where his dream became a reality. Rick's first taping was the Hee Haw 10th Anniversary Show taped at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tn in October 1978.

He was inducted into both the Texas Steel Guitar Hall of Fame and the International Steel Guitar Hall of Fame. Brumley died in 2009. Don Rich died in a motorcycle accident in 1974. At the time Rich was the only original member still with the Buckaroos and the band was struggling to find their way back at the top of the Country Music Charts.
