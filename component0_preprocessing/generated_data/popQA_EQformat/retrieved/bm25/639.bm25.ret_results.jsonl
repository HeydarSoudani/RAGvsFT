Music of New Spain, especially that of Juan Guti\u00e9rrez de Padilla and Hernando Franco, is increasingly recognized as a significant contribution to New World culture. Although the traditions of European opera and especially Italian opera had initially dominated the Mexican music conservatories and strongly influenced native opera composers , elements of Mexican nationalism had already appeared by the latter part of the 19th century with operas such as Aniceto Ortega del Villar's 1871 Guatimotzin, a romanticised account of the defense of Mexico by its last Aztec ruler, Cuauht\u00e9moc. \u00c1ngela Peralta was an operatic soprano of international fame, known in Europe as \"The Mexican Nightingale\", who sang in the premieres of operas by Paniagua, Morales, and Ortega del Villar. Mexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes mariachi, banda, norte\u00f1o, ranchera and corridos; on an everyday basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as pop, rock, etc. in both English and Spanish. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in Central and South America and parts of the United States and Europe, especially Spain. Elements from the Indigenous peoples of Mexico music have deeply influenced Mexico's music at large, distinguishing it from European and Asian traditions. The Bolero, Cha-cha-cha and Mambo invade the radio of the 40s and 50s mimicking the idiosyncrasy of the Mexican. Known as Agust\u00edn Lara, the Mexican composer was and interpreter of songs and boleros, most popular songwriter of his era. C\u00e9sar Costa and Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda in the 1970s performed cover versions of songs and their own as most of the pop music produced in Mexico consisted on Spanish-language versions of English-language rock-and-roll hits. Grupera music became definitely popular in the 1990s to collectively refer to what is now referred to as regional Mexican music.

{"id": "639_4", "question": "Who was the composer of Hair?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_17067", "text": "Hair was conceived by actors James Rado and Gerome Ragni.  The two met in 1964 when they performed together in the Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die, and they began writing Hair together in late 1964.  The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert.  Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical.  Rado explained, \"We were great friends.  It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece.  We put the drama between us on stage.\" Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations.  We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".  He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.\u00a0... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\" Many cast members were recruited right off the street.  Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples.  You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it.  We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\" Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition.  He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg.  Ragni, on the other hand, was an active member of The Open Theater, one of several groups, mostly Off-off Broadway, that were developing experimental theatre techniques.  He introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater.  In 1966, while the two were developing Hair, Ragni performed in The Open Theater's production of Megan Terry's play, Viet Rock, a story about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War. In addition to the war theme, Viet Rock employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of Hair. Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition \"African Waltz\" .  The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: \"I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.\"  \"I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni.\"  But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show.  \"We work independently\", explained MacDermot in May 1968.  \"I prefer it that way.  They hand me the material.  I set it to music.\"  MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs \"I Got Life\", \"Ain't Got No\", \"Where Do I Go\" and the title song.

Bach had visited Leipzig during Kuhnau's tenure: in 1714 he attended the service at the St.\u00a0Thomas Church on the first Sunday of Advent, and in 1717 he had tested the organ of the St. Paul's Church. In 1716 Bach and Kuhnau had met on the occasion of the testing and inauguration of an organ in Halle. After being offered the position, Bach was invited to Leipzig only after Georg Philipp Telemann indicated that he would not be interested in relocating to Leipzig. Telemann went to Hamburg, where he \"had his own struggles with the city's senate\". Bach was required to instruct the students of the  in singing and provide church music for the main churches in Leipzig. He was also assigned to teach Latin but was allowed to employ four \"prefects\" to do this instead. The prefects also aided with musical instruction. A cantata was required for the church services on Sundays and additional church holidays during the liturgical year. Cantata cycle years Bach usually led performances of his cantatas, most of which were composed within three years of his relocation to Leipzig. The first was , performed in the St. Nicholas Church on 30 May 1723, the first Sunday after Trinity. Bach collected his cantatas in annual cycles. Five are mentioned in obituaries, three are extant. Of the more than 300 cantatas which Bach composed in Leipzig, over 100 have been lost to posterity. Most of these works expound on the Gospel readings prescribed for every Sunday and feast day in the Lutheran year. Bach started a second annual cycle the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 and composed only chorale cantatas, each based on a single church hymn. These include , , , and . Bach drew the soprano and alto choristers from the school and the tenors and basses from the school and elsewhere in Leipzig. Performing at weddings and funerals provided extra income for these groups; it was probably for this purpose, and for in-school training, that he wrote at least six motets. As part of his regular church work, he performed other composers' motets, which served as formal models for his own. Bach's predecessor as cantor, Johann Kuhnau, had also been music director for the St. Paul's Church, the church of Leipzig University. But when Bach was installed as cantor in 1723, he was put in charge only of music for festal services at the St. Paul's Church; his petition to also provide music for regular Sunday services there went all the way to the Elector but was denied. After this, in 1725, Bach \"lost interest\" in working even for festal services at the St. Paul's Church and appeared there only on \"special occasions\". The St. Paul's Church had a much better and newer organ than did the St. Thomas Church or the St. Nicholas Church. Bach was not required to play any organ in his official duties, but it is believed he liked to play on the St. Paul's Church organ \"for his own pleasure\". Bach broadened his composing and performing beyond the liturgy by taking over, in March 1729, the directorship of the Collegium Musicum, a secular performance ensemble started by Telemann. This was one of the dozens of private societies in the major German-speaking cities that were established by musically active university students; these societies had become increasingly important in public musical life and were typically led by the most prominent professionals in a city. In the words of Christoph Wolff, assuming the directorship was a shrewd move that \"consolidated Bach's firm grip on Leipzig's principal musical institutions\". Year round, Leipzig's Collegium Musicum performed regularly in venues such as the Caf\u00e9 Zimmermann, a coffeehouse on Catherine Street off the main market square. Many of Bach's works during the 1730s and 1740s were written for and performed by the Collegium Musicum; among these were parts of his  and many of his violin and keyboard concertos. Middle years of the Leipzig period In 1733, Bach composed a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass in B\u00a0minor which he later incorporated in his Mass in B minor. He presented the manuscript to the Elector in an eventually successful bid to persuade the prince to give him the title of Court Composer. He later extended this work into a full mass by adding a , , and , the music for which was partly based on his own cantatas and partly original. Bach's appointment as Court Composer was an element of his long-term struggle to achieve greater bargaining power with the Leipzig council. Between 1737 and 1739, Bach's former pupil Carl Gotthelf Gerlach held the directorship of the Collegium Musicum. In 1735 Bach started to prepare his first publication of organ music, which was printed as the third Clavier-\u00dcbung in 1739. From around that year he started to compile and compose the set of preludes and fugues for harpsichord that would become his second book of The Well-Tempered Clavier. He received the title of \"Royal Court Composer\" from Augustus\u00a0III in 1736. Final years and death From 1740 to 1748 Bach copied, transcribed, expanded or programmed music in an older polyphonic style by, among others, Palestrina , Kerll , Torri , Bassani , Gasparini and Caldara . Bach's own style shifted in the last decade of his life, showing an increased integration of polyphonic structures and canons and other elements of the stile antico. His fourth and last Clavier-\u00dcbung volume, the Goldberg Variations, for two-manual harpsichord, contained nine canons and was published in 1741. Throughout this period, Bach also continued to adopt music of contemporaries such as Handel and St\u00f6lzel , and gave many of his own earlier compositions, such as the St Matthew and St John Passions and the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes, their final revisions. He also programmed and adapted music by composers of a younger generation, including Pergolesi and his own students such as Goldberg . In 1746 Bach was preparing to enter Lorenz Christoph Mizler's . In order to be admitted Bach had to submit a composition, for which he chose his Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\", and a portrait, which was painted by Elias Gottlob Haussmann and featured Bach's Canon triplex \u00e1 6 Voc. In May 1747, Bach visited the court of King Frederick\u00a0II of Prussia in Potsdam. The king played a theme for Bach and challenged him to improvise a fugue based on his theme. Bach obliged, playing a three-part fugue on one of Frederick's fortepianos by Gottfried Silbermann, which was a new type of instrument at the time. Upon his return to Leipzig he composed a set of fugues and canons, and a trio sonata, based on the Thema Regium . Within a few weeks this music was published as The Musical Offering and dedicated to Frederick. The Sch\u00fcbler Chorales, a set of six chorale preludes transcribed from cantata movements Bach had composed some two decades earlier, were published within a year. Around the same time, the set of five canonic variations which Bach had submitted when entering Mizler's society in 1747 were also printed. Two large-scale compositions occupied a central place in Bach's last years. From around 1742 he wrote and revised the various canons and fugues of The Art of Fugue, which he continued to prepare for publication until shortly before his death. After extracting a cantata, BWV\u00a0191 from his 1733 Kyrie-Gloria Mass for the Dresden court in the mid 1740s, Bach expanded that setting into his Mass in B minor in the last years of his life. Although the complete mass was never performed during the composer's lifetime, it is considered to be among the greatest choral works in history. In January 1749, Bach's daughter Elisabeth Juliane Friederica married his pupil Johann Christoph Altnickol. Bach's health was, however, declining. On 2 June, Heinrich von Br\u00fchl wrote to one of the Leipzig burgomasters to request that his music director, Johann Gottlob Harrer, fill the  and  posts \"upon the eventual\u00a0... decease of Mr. Bach\". Becoming blind, Bach underwent eye surgery, in March 1750 and again in April, by the British eye surgeon John Taylor, a man widely understood today as a charlatan and believed to have blinded hundreds of people. Bach died on 28 July 1750 from complications due to the unsuccessful treatment. An inventory drawn up a few months after Bach's death shows that his estate included five harpsichords, two lute-harpsichords, three violins, three violas, two cellos, a viola da gamba, a lute and a spinet, along with 52 \"sacred books\", including works by Martin Luther and Josephus. The composer's son Carl Philipp Emanuel saw to it that The Art of Fugue, although still unfinished, was published in 1751. Together with one of the composer's former students, Johann Friedrich Agricola, the son also wrote the obituary , which was published in Mizler's , the organ of the Society of Musical Sciences, in 1754.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Brian's earliest musical education appears to have been as a choirboy; he sang in the choir at St James' church in Longton. In 1887 he and other choristers from his home town participated in a concert in Lichfield Cathedral marking the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. This experience gave the boy an interest in large-scale musical effects. At the age of 12, after leaving the elementary school attached to the church, he started work . In his spare time, he continued to study music including the organ for which he showed talent at a young age; as a composer he was virtually self-taught. From 1896 he was organist of All Saints', a Gothic Revival church in Odd Rode, just across the county border in Cheshire. The post involved playing at Sunday services; his main job at this time was with a timber company. Around the time he started at All Saints', he was influenced by hearing King Olaf, a composition for soloists, choir and orchestra by Edward Elgar.

Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too. Stanton originally wanted to juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music, but he saw The Triplets of Belleville and did not want to appear as if he were copying it. Stanton then thought about the song \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\" from Hello, Dolly!, since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production. Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love, which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. Jim Reardon, storyboard supervisor for the film, suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included \"It Only Takes a Moment\" and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. Hello Dolly! composer Jerry Herman allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story \"genius\". Coincidentally, Newman's uncle Lionel worked on Hello, Dolly! Newman travelled to London to compose the end credits song \"Down to Earth\" with Peter Gabriel, who was one of Stanton's favorite musicians. Afterwards, Newman rescored some of the film to include the song's composition, so it would not sound intrusive when played. Louis Armstrong's rendition of \"La Vie en rose\" was used for a montage where WALL-E attempts to impress EVE on Earth. The script also specified using Bing Crosby's \"Stardust\" for when the two robots dance around the Axiom, but Newman asked if he could score the scene himself. A similar switch occurred for the sequence in which WALL-E attempts to wake EVE up through various means; originally, the montage would play with the instrumental version of \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\", but Newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for the sequence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The majority of music played by British military bands around this time consisted of popular music and orchestral transcriptions. No serious music had yet been composed specifically for the band medium, and there was no standardised instrumentation. The lack of a set instrumentation was a major obstacle for composers, in addition to the pervasive belief that an ensemble of assorted wind instruments lacked the tonal cohesiveness to produce significant music. The Suite in E was Holst's first composition written for military band. Frederick Fennell, in Time and the Winds, observes that Holst's scoring for the work is so well conceived and organised for the band medium, that he must have had some previous experiences with groups of this kind. Indeed, Holst was himself a formidable trombonist, having already performed several seasons with the Scottish Orchestra prior to the composition of the suite. In addition, while still in college, he performed during the summers with various seaside bands, and was admittedly unsatisfied with the music that those ensembles performed. Even though these experiences likely contributed to the composition of the suite, there is no recorded commission for the work, and the reason for Holst's writing of the suite is unknown. In addition to being a serious work written for band, the orchestration of the suite was tailored to handle the inherent challenges of the military band. As there was no standardised instrumentation, Holst scored the suite for 19 instruments, with 17 remaining parts labelled \"ad lib.\", meaning they were unnecessary for performance. As most British military bands of the day employed between 20 and 30 musicians, the 19 required parts could reasonably be expected to be covered, and the remaining parts could be added or discarded as needed without disturbing the integrity of the work. The First Suite was a catalysing force that convinced many other prominent composers that serious music could be written specifically for the combination of woodwinds, percussion and brass. Works such as the English Folk Song Suite of Ralph Vaughan Williams and the William Byrd Suite of Gordon Jacob are leading examples. The piece was later arranged for brass band by Sydney Herbert, and this arrangement has been used as a contest set test piece on numerous occasions, including for the British regional brass band championships in 1970, 1983 and 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Anh. 222/19b, was probably written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in early 1765 in London. It is one of the twelve symphonies that Ludwig von K\u00f6chel only knew by its incipit in the Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel manuscript catalogue , which listed it as one of six symphonies sourced from Luigi Gatti , Court Kapellmeister in Salzburg from around 1782: The instrumentation for the symphony is unknown, but Alfred Einstein speculated that it would have been the same as the contemporary known symphonies K. 16 and K. 19 . In his third edition of the K\u00f6chel catalogue, he dated it to early 1765 in London, and opined that the incipit showed the influence of J. C. Bach's symphonies. His remarks were copied unchanged by the sixth edition of the K\u00f6chel catalogue. Neal Zaslaw agreed that the opening was characteristic of J. C. Bach in his book Mozart's Symphonies, but questioned if this was a legitimate method of dating works, given that the seven symphonies of J. C. Bach beginning in this march-like way were written later than Mozart's stay in London, that Mozart himself used similar openings in later works , and that this style of opening was much used by other composers as well in the period. Thus he opines that a stylistical analysis cannot credibly be performed until the work is rediscovered. Nevertheless, the wrapper used for the set of parts to enclose the K. 19 symphony in D had been used previously for a symphony in F and then one in C , as can be seen from the deletions and insertions on the title page, which suggested to Zaslaw that Mozart had written a C major symphony before K. 19 and that K. 19b should receive a lower K\u00f6chel number. Stephen Fischer however pointed out in his 1995 review of Zaslaw's book that the scores were parts rather than full scores, thus not constituting solid evidence for such a chronology. He also speculates that K. 19b may have been the symphony Maria Anna Mozart referred to when she remembered Wolfgang having \"composed his first symphony with all the instruments of the orchestra, especially Trumpets and Kettledrums\" when Leopold was dangerously ill. K. 16, though traditionally numbered as the first symphony, does not have this instrumentation: thus a lost work must be referred to. Though Zaslaw identified it with a possible E major symphony possibly derived from pieces in the London Sketchbook , Fischer believed that the use of trumpets and timpani would be more likely for a C major symphony like K. 19b. Though the wrapper for K. 19 does not mention trumpets nor timpani, he notes that the set of parts was originally for an F-major symphony and that Leopold may not have deemed it necessary to change the list of parts. The authenticity of this symphony is more credibly shown by the source attribution to Gatti in the Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel manuscript catalogue, making it plausible that it was among the six sent to Donaueschingen by Leopold Mozart in 1767.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was a drunkard with all these problems and accidents because he and his wife Cathy, who's played by Gina Gershon, had this very tumultuous relationship. I'm giving you a little biographical hint here. And he just started to come apart. So he was brought back as kind of like how people should never be. It's like taking kids who are truants and then taking them to prison to see where they'll end up and scaring them straight. So I was brought back to basically prove to young Jimmy Bly how he should never be, as a bad example. And then the more we worked on it, it became the dark side, a little seedy, and I didn't know where the upside of it was ever going to be. So we began to reduce his role and make it more of an ensemble, so he's just there as a guy who did his job, wasn't very spectacular, would race like hell, sometimes he'd win, sometimes lose, but he had a certain work ethic code, that old school that could be applied to Jimmy. So that all made it more ensemble, and then in the editing we reduced it even more. I originally had a relationship going with the reporter. But that began to de-emphasise the other people, so we put that on the back burner...

It's all the same kind of situation. And you realize that you can't always be No. 1. You just can't be the guy in front all the time. So what you can do is lend support to, and help and nourish and encourage someone else. So it's like your experiences live on in someone else. If you can find some young actor and you can say, 'Listen, don't do this and don't do that and avoid this and that,' and share your experiences, and he does succeed, you can say, 'You know what, I kind of contributed to that.'

Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer's son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. The widow Irina continues to reject the book. Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the USSR at the time as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the USSR, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich. However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the political situation in the USSR and correctly represents his father's political views, but continues to speak of the book as being \"about my father, not by him\". In 1980, after defecting from the USSR, he denied the book was his father's memoirs. Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich's signatures raised by Laurel Fay and therefore their competence in judging the book's authenticity as Shostakovich's memoirs is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited . The claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the USSR. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of Testimony and told his family that \"Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn't have written this, let alone allowed its publication.

In an article written in the same year, \"The Regime and Vulgarity\", Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg , and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with the book before signing the condemnation. As a translator of Testimony, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of Testimony in his possession, and he claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich.

The origins of Polish music can be traced to the 13th century; manuscripts have been found in Stary S\u0105cz containing polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School. Other early compositions, such as the melody of Bogurodzica and God Is Born , may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, Nicholas of Radom, lived in the 15th century. Diomedes Cato, a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III; he not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe but blended them with native folk music. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers wrote liturgical music and secular compositions such as concertos and sonatas for voices or instruments. At the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the polonaise. Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski is accredited with composing the first Polish national opera, titled Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale, which premiered in 1794. Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many Polish composers, and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin, a widely recognised national hero of the arts. All of Chopin's works involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the musical form known as the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, polonaise, \u00e9tude, impromptu and pr\u00e9lude, he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Several Polish composers such as Szymanowski drew inspiration from Chopin's folk-influenced style. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of Zakopane. Poland today has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as Krzysztof Komeda created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day.

This may have been the reason why bishop Guy composed the Carmen de Hastingae Proelio , as an effort to flatter the new Norman king of England, William I, who was then in very high favor with the pope. But if so, bishop Guy's poem failed in its purpose. He was highly enough thought of at the Norman court to be assigned as Matilda of Flanders's chaplain when she went over to England for her coronation in 1068. But when bishop Guy died in 1075, he still had not regained his bishopric.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At the heart of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline, which spawned numerous questions and discussions among viewers. Encouraged by Losts writers and stars, who often interacted with fans online, viewers and TV critics alike took to widespread theorizing in an attempt to unravel the mysteries. Theories mainly concerned the nature of the island, the origins of the \"Monster\" and the \"Others\", the meaning of the numbers, and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers. Several of the more common fan theories were discussed and rejected by the show's creators, the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic flight 815 are dead and in purgatory. Lindelof rejected speculation that spaceships or aliens influenced the events on the island or that everything seen was a fictional reality taking place in someone's mind.

The story follows a player character known as the Inquisitor on a journey to settle the civil unrest in the continent of Thedas and close a mysterious tear in the sky called the \"Breach\", which is unleashing dangerous demons upon the world. Dragon Age: Inquisitions gameplay is similar to its predecessors, although it consists of several semi-open worlds for players to explore. Players control the Inquisitor or their companions mainly from a third-person perspective, although a traditional role-playing game top-down camera angle is also available. The release of Dragon Age II was met with a mixed reception from players who lamented the loss of the complexity of the first game, Dragon Age: Origins . BioWare sought to address player feedback for Dragon Age II as a major goal, which influenced the design decisions of its sequel. Ultimately, BioWare wanted the third Dragon Age game to combine the elements of the first two games in the series. Having begun development in 2011, BioWare used EA DICE's Frostbite\u00a03 engine to power the game, though this created many development challenges for the team. They had to crunch extensively during development, and because of hardware limitations on older generation consoles several gameplay features had to be cut. Trevor Morris composed the game's soundtrack, replacing Inon Zur, the composer used for the previous games. Officially announced in September 2012 as Dragon Age III: Inquisition, the game was released worldwide in November 2014 for Windows, PlayStation\u00a03, PlayStation\u00a04, Xbox\u00a0360, and Xbox One. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with critics praising its exploration gameplay, combat, visuals, writing, characters and customization. The game received some criticism for its filler content, technical issues, tactical view, and aspects of its narrative. Commercially, it was one of the most successful games released by BioWare.

With the combined influence of \"Cloud Piece\" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as \"a humanistic paean for the people\". Blaney wrote, \"Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential.\" Rolling Stones David Fricke commented: \"[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class.\" Lennon stated: \"'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\" He told NME: \"There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism.\" Ono described the lyrical statement of \"Imagine\" as \"just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people.\" Rolling Stone described its lyrics as \"22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself\". The original piano musical motif was created in January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions. Lennon finished composing \"Imagine\" one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session. Described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C.

Development began immediately after Uchikoshi's first visual novel, Memories Off, was finished. He was unable to make heavy use of science fiction themes in Never 7, as his superiors at KID told him that the game needed to include cute girl characters in order to sell; he kept science fiction themes light, and the game was designed with a focus on dating game elements, with the main focus being to develop a relationship with a girl. The Dreamcast version includes new scenarios not available in the PlayStation version. The development team depicted reality in the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Cur\u00e9 syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as \"vague existences\", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which \"should be fictional\" remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die at some point during the game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what the answer would be. The game's soundtrack was composed by Takeshi Abo, and features \"geometric music\" because of the game's theoretical and science fiction elements. Prior to composing the music, he read through the game's story, to understand the setting and each character's personality as much as possible. He would write his impressions of the plot, with a focus on the \"emotional flow\" and the events that occur throughout the story; he valued his first impressions as very important for this. According to Abo, this method takes longer time, but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to the game's world than if he had just designated different songs to different points of the game. Because he enjoyed the story, the music strongly reflects Abo's own musical tastes. The opening and ending themes of the PlayStation Portable version, titled \"Sen Oku no Hoshikuzu Furasu Yoru no Sora\" and \"Hokorobishi Hana\", respectively, were performed by the band Asriel. The game was originally released by KID for PlayStation under the title Infinity on March 23, 2000. A Neo Geo Pocket version titled Infinity Cure was released on November 23, 2000, also by KID. On December 21, 2000, KID released a Dreamcast version titled Never 7: The End of Infinity; this version was also released for Microsoft Windows on October 26, 2001, and for PlayStation 2 on May 22, 2003.

The older game renders its characters by tesselation, using thousands of polygons to make up character models and decreasing the number of polygons when lesser details are required, such as drawing the object at a distance. A typical object in Sacrifice comprises 200 to 2,500\u00a0polygons. Shiny expanded the technology's application to the game's virtual world. The environment is not decorated with grass, flowers, and rocks by overlaying two-dimensional images of such objects on the terrain model. Instead, many tiny models of these terrain features litter the landscape. Objects in the game are composed of isosceles right triangles, each of which is infinitely divisible into two smaller isosceles right triangles. The array of infinite triangles derived from these divisions is stored in a binary triangle tree data structure, and the simplicity of the division and its data management algorithms frees up the graphic processor for other duties, allowing more resources to be spent on managing the level of detail. Sacrifices spell effects are composed of parametric surfaces, which also can be broken down into triangles, facilitating tessellation. In early 2000, the computer industry released the first video graphics cards capable of processing transform, clipping, and lighting instructions. With the appropriate software, these new cards took over the burden of T&L processing from the computer's processor, allowing more detailed graphics and smoother animation. Shiny capitalized on the breakthrough, spending a few weeks to rewrite a portion of Sacrifices software. Brownlow and his team refined and improved the game's graphics, increasing the number of polygons per model and setting the software to scan through scenes a few more times to determine what objects to render and how to display them. Sacrifice was acknowledged as the first game on the market to make full use of the new graphic cards . Because of the adopted technology, animation in the game was smooth, without the jerkiness associated with overstressed graphical engines. For the character models, Otero and his team eschewed conventional designs inspired by The Lord of the Rings and other fantasies. Otero's ideal was that of \"form follows function\", by which a creature's capabilities or purposes are readily apparent from its appearance. In his opinion, a creature designed to kill enemies by exploding itself would simply be a \"cartoon-ish bomb with feet\". Otero's simple designs were expanded and fleshed out in detail by Gwyn, who was also responsible for creating Eldred's model. The artists' incorporation of humor in their work did not escape the video game industry's notice; many pointed out the quirky allusion of James, God of Earth, to Earthworm Jim, star of Shiny's previous games.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Thirty-eight Ventures albums charted in the US, and six of fourteen chart singles made it into the Top 40, with three making it into the Top 10. Of their 38 chart albums, 34 of them occurred in the 1960s, and the Ventures rank as the 6th best pop album performer for that decade, according to \"Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Albums\". Among their achievements in America, in 1963 the Ventures had five LPs in the Billboard Top 100 of the albums chart at the same time. Additionally, they released a series of instructional LPs entitled Play Guitar with the Ventures and Play Electric Bass with the Ventures. Four LPs were released in this series, the first of which reached the Billboard Top 100 Album Chart\u2014an achievement previously unheard of for an instructional LP. In a novelty achievement, the Ventures were the first act to place two different versions of the same song in the Top 10, those being \"Walk, Don't Run\" and \"Walk, Don't Run '64\" . The Ventures were among the first rock acts able to sell albums based on a style and sound without needing hit singles on the albums. These albums are also some of the earliest examples of the concept album in rock music. Many of the Ventures' albums, starting with Colorful Ventures in 1961, were organized according to a central theme. While they predated the advent of the terms surf guitar and surf rock, and they do not consider themselves a surf rock group, they were a major building block of surf music, if not the first to play the style. Guitar Player, in an article titled \"20 Essential Rock Albums\", cited elements of their 1960 Walk, Don't Run album which presaged the coming surf trend. The theme music of the television show Hawaii Five-O continues to be popular. The tune was composed by Morton Stevens, who also composed numerous episode scores. The theme was recorded by the Ventures, whose version reached No.\u00a04 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. Because of the tempo of the music, the theme gained popularity in the UK with followers of Northern soul and was popular on dance floors in the 1970s.

The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons. The film is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for Ran. Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed Dersu Uzala in 1975, followed by Kagemusha in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film Ran. Ran was Kurosawa's third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed , based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. In 1960, he directed the film , based on Hamlet. Despite the changes in setting and language, all three films have received critical acclaim. As Kurosawa's last epic, Ran has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.

The original plan was to mount a stage production at the Bolshoi Theatre under the direction of Vsevolod Meyerhold, but plans fell through because Meyerhold was too busy with other productions. The stage premiere, conducted by Samuil Samosud, took place at the Maly Operny Theatre in Leningrad on 18 January 1930.

Even so, the conductor Nikolai Malko, who had taught Shostakovich at the Leningrad Conservatory and conducted the premiere of his pupil's First Symphony, reckoned the opera a \"tremendous success\"; indeed it was given 16 performances with two alternating casts over six months. The opera was not performed again in the Soviet Union until 1974, when it was revived by Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Boris Pokrovsky.

For Halloween, Carpenter chose to use a piano melody played in a 5/4 time rhythm instead of a symphonic soundtrack. Critic James Berardinelli calls the score \"relatively simple and unsophisticated\", but admits that \"Halloween's music is one of its strongest assets.\" Carpenter stated in an interview, \"I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note.\" In the end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the \"Bowling Green Orchestra\" for performing the film's score, but he did receive assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at San Jose State University. The score for Halloween II is a variation of John Carpenter's compositions from the first film, particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played. The score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than the piano used for Halloween. One reviewer for the BBC described the revised score as having \"a more Gothic feel\". The reviewer asserted that it \"doesn't sound quite as good as the original piece\", but \"it still remains a classic piece of music\". Music remained an important element in establishing the atmosphere of Halloween III. Just as in Halloween and Halloween II, there was no symphonic score. Much of the music was composed to solicit \"false startles\" from the audience. The soundtrack was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, who had also worked on the score for Halloween II. The score of Halloween III differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and its first sequel. Carpenter replaced the familiar piano melody with a slower, electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping tonalities. Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film: The music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music. This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has 'instant gratification', allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the picture. This is quite an invaluable asset. Following Carpenter's departure from the series, Howarth would stay on board as the sole composer for the next two sequels, and also acted as the lead composer on Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, with Paul Rabjohns providing additional music when the initial edit of the film was substantially re-filmed. While Halloween H20 credits John Ottman as its sole composer, in reality most of the soundtrack was provided by Scream composer Marco Beltrami, using a mixture of music from that film and a few original cues written by Beltrami, after the producers disliked Ottman's score. Danny Lux provided the soundtrack for Halloween: Resurrection, while Tyler Bates composed the soundtracks for both the 2007 Halloween reboot and its 2009 sequel.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This was the composer's first encounter with the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique, as the Paris Op\u00e9ra was officially known. Among 19th-century Italian composers, there had been an increasing interest in writing for Paris, where the combination of money, prestige, and flexibility of style were appealing.  Musicologist Julian Budden provides examples of those composers who had crossed the Alps, the most well-known being Rossini and Donizetti However, Verdi had given some consideration of the idea of adapting one of the librettos written by Temistocle Solera in earlier years, librettos which music historian David Kimball regards as having something of grand opera in their structure. After conducting the premiere of I masnadieri in London and within a week of Verdi's arrival in Paris on 27 July 1847, he received his first commission from the company, agreeing to adapt I Lombardi to a new French libretto. The adaptation meant that Verdi could \"try his hand at grand opera\" without having to write something entirely new, a strategy which both Donizetti and Rossini had employed for their Paris debuts. There are significant changes in the location and action of the French version of Lombardi, especially given the need to set the story for French involvement in the First Crusade of 1095\u20131099. Characters' names changed from Italian to French and one, Arvino was now a baritone instead of a tenor. Several roles present in the original version were deleted, including the leading tenor role of Oronte. In the restructured libretto, the central romance is given more prominence, and a happier ending.  In addition, Verdi added a standard ballet and new music, but re-shaped much of the structure by removing inappropriate material he felt to be weak.  As musicologist Roger Parker notes, \"only a few of the original numbers [remain] in their former positions.\"  Verdi himself described the new work as having \"transformed [I Lombardi] out of recognition\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk.

{"id": "639_78", "question": "Who was the composer of Harp Concerto?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_57122", "text": "Mozart wrote the concerto in April 1778, during his seven-month sojourn in Paris. It was commissioned by Adrien-Louis de Bonni\u00e8res, duc de Gu\u00eenes , a flutist, for his use and for that of his eldest daughter, Marie-Louise-Philippine , a harpist, who was taking composition lessons from the composer, at the duke's home, the H\u00f4tel de Castries. Mozart stated in a letter to his father that he thought the duke played the flute \"extremely well\" and that Marie's playing of the harp was \"magnifique\". As a composition student, however, Mozart found Marie thoroughly inept. The duke , an aristocrat Mozart came to despise, never paid the composer for this work, and Mozart instead was offered only half the expected fee for the lessons, through de Guines' housekeeper. But he refused it. Little is known of the work's early performance history, though it seems probable that father and daughter played it first. In the classical period, the harp was still in development, and was not considered a standard orchestral instrument. It was regarded more as a plucked piano. Therefore, harp and flute was considered an extremely unusual combination. Currently, there is much more repertoire for a flute and harp duo, especially without orchestra. Much of this repertoire was written by composers in the nineteenth century. Mozart's opinion of the harp, however, was perhaps dubious at best, for he never wrote another piece that employed it. Mozart quite likely composed this work with the duke's and his daughter's particular musical abilities in mind. He probably composed the majority of this concerto at the home of Joseph Legros, the director of the Concert Spirituel. Monsieur Legros had given Mozart the use of his keyboard in his home so that he could compose. The piece is essentially in the form of a Sinfonia Concertante, which was extremely popular in Paris at the time. Today, the concerto is often played by chamber ensembles, because it is technically and elegantly challenging for both the solo instruments it calls for. It is also often played by orchestras to display the talents of their own flutists and harpists. The harp part appears to be more like an adaptation of a piano piece than an original harp part; this is especially evident in the patterns of five and ten notes throughout all three movements which would not fall under the fingers as easily for a harpist, as the fifth fingers are typically not used, though they were considered part of early harp technique. There are no full, rich glissandi, and although there is counterpoint in the harp part, it does not typically include lush chords. Mozart did not include any cadenzas of his own, as is normal for his compositions. Alfred Einstein claims that Mozart's cadenzas for this work were lost. A few popular cadenzas are often performed, such as those by Carl Reinecke, but many flutists and harpists have chosen to write their own. Andr\u00e9 Previn has also written cadenzas for this piece.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Later that same month, on July 22, she announced her then upcoming seventh extended play, Trouble, which was released on August 15, 2018. In August 2019, popular non-fiction author Narumi Komatsu released a novel about Hamasaki entitled M Aisubeki Hito ga Ite, in which it was revealed that the singer has had romantic feelings towards her producer Max Matsuura. The book was written based on interviews with Hamasaki herself and gives a rare insight in the artist's private life and her road to stardom. The book instantly became a best-seller, and reached #1 in the charts. A television drama-series based on the novel aired from April to July 2020.

The city also played host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 and the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004. Rome has also had a major impact on music history. The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.

Flow received mixed reviews from critics, who focused on the game's PlayStation versions. The visuals and presentation were among its most praised elements, with IGN's Chris Roper calling them \"one of Flows greatest strengths\". Alex Navarro of GameSpot agreed, saying that it was \"hard to argue with those aesthetics\"; he lauded the use of color, the designs of the creatures, and the dynamic soundtrack. Will Freeman of VideoGamer.com called it \"attractive and stylish\", which made the game \"immensely satisfying to toy with\". Richard Leadbetter of Eurogamer claimed that the game's main purpose was to \"look pretty\" and \"sound cool\". Reviewers were mixed in their opinions on the gameplay; Roper said that \"simply see[ing] what's next\" was enjoyable, but acknowledged that the game's activities were limited beyond this aspect. Leadbetter went further, saying Flow \"feels like a tech demo in many ways\", and that its small amount of gameplay existed primarily \"to act as a tour guide\" through the visuals and audio. Freeman said that \"it would not be unfair to describe Flow as empty and without substance.\" Navarro concluded that Flow was enjoyable for the few hours needed to complete it, but it lacked \"a lasting gameplay experience\"; he attributed this to the game's \"heavy emphasis on aesthetics over gameplay\". Luke Mitchell of PALGN, however, felt that \"anything more complicated would take away from the friendly nature of an experience of this type.\" Reviewers found the game to be largely unchallenging. Roper stated that \"there really isn't any sort of a challenge here\", particularly due to the player character's inability to die; Leadbetter summed up the game's difficulty as \"negligible\". However, when reviewing the PlayStation Portable version of the game, Justin Calvart of GameSpot took the view that \"the game's difficulty masterfully scales to match your skill level\", so it does not become overly \"frantic or frustrating\". Reviewers were universally dismissive of the multiplayer mode, with Calvart saying that \"whatever it is, it's not good\". Leadbetter called the PlayStation\u00a03 version's multiplayer \"little more than an afterthought\", while Navarro said it \"doesn't add a lick of depth to the experience\".

Leadbetter believed that it was more of an experiment than a traditional game, and described it as a \"trippy ornament\". Freeman called it the PlayStation 3's \"first art-house title\".

However, the producer Lew Leslie believed that they still missed a 'smash' tune. The team pondered for a while before finally playing Leslie \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\". This was the song Leslie had been looking for and he immediately included it in the revue. One advertisement called it \"the song success of the Nation.\" Blackbird Revue opened on January 4, 1928, with Adelaide Hall singing \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\" solo. Later on, Fields and McHugh wrote a second half for the revue and Leslie expanded the production. With extra songs and extra performers added , Leslie renamed the revue Blackbirds of 1928 and took the full production for a tryout in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it appeared at Nixon's Apollo Theatre. On May 9, 1928, Blackbirds of 1928 opened at the Liberty Theatre, Broadway. The idea behind the song came during a stroll Fields and McHugh were taking one evening down Fifth Avenue; they saw a young couple window-shopping at Tiffany's. McHugh and Fields understood that the couple could not afford to buy jewelry from Tiffany's, but nevertheless they drew closer to them. It was then they heard the man say, \"Gee, honey I'd like to get you a sparkler like that, but right now, i can't give you nothin' but love!\" Hearing this, McHugh and Fields rushed to a nearby Steinway Tunnel, and within an hour they came up with \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\". Some controversy surrounds the song's authorship. Andy Razaf's biographer Harry Singer offers circumstantial evidence that suggests Fats Waller might have sold the melody to McHugh in 1926 and that the lyrics were by Andy Razaf. Alternatively, Philip Furia has pointed out that Fields' verse is almost identical to the end of the second verse of Lorenz Hart's and Richard Rodgers' song \"Where's That Rainbow?\" from Peggy-Ann, the 1926 musical comedy with book by Fields' brother Herbert and produced by their father Lew:", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_88", "question": "Who was the composer of May This Be Love?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_77754", "text": "Faith's music displays a freely modulating harmonic language within the boundaries of tonality that combines neo-romantic and impressionistic qualities. With Debussy, Ravel, and Rachmaninoff as important influences on his music, and Brahms as a model with respect to form, Faith also shares musical traits with Vaughan Williams, particularly in the areas of modality and harmonic color and with Roger Quilter, the Victorian whose songs displayed a trait known as \"decorous Romanticism.\" Faith's English flavor is even further highlighted by the composer's choice of poetry, much of which comes from English and Irish authors. Having developed a somewhat dry wit and an infectious, silly humor, Faith infrequently reflected these personality traits in his music, leaning more toward a sound that exudes a deep longing and romantic spirit. Faith's song output spans the years 1944 to the present\u2014his entire life as a composer. The over 120 settings run the stylistic gamut from sophisticated concert pieces to simple miniatures, duets, vocalises and selections with obbligato instruments, including flute, cello, viola and harp. His settings are generally for medium voice. Some have been written for specific singers to whom he has dedicated the music. Many of the songs are grouped according to subject matter, but are not necessarily musically connected. They may be sung as sets or separately, and may be transposed to suit the singer. Faith's tempo indications use traditional Italian terminology and the metronome markings are only suggestions. He is a gracious composer who allows individuals to develop their own interpretations of his music. Because Faith himself is a pianist, many of the songs have sophisticated accompaniments. Sometimes the piano doubles the voice, though hardly ever through an entire piece. At other times the piano will play a countermelody to the voice to form a kind of obbligato. Like Debussy, Faith has a fondness for triplets, because of the movement and flow they add to a song. Thomas Nashe's \"Spring, the Sweet Spring\" is an exercise in perpetual motion for the accompanist, with only brief repose at the end of each stanza. This inventive, florid accompaniment, along with Faith's strict use of ABA form, thin texture, and a definite key signature lend a neo-baroque character to this Elizabethan poem. The harmony, however, remains contemporary, with Faith's use of incidental chromatics and added-note chords. Like many composers who rely on modality rather than tonality, Faith rarely uses key signatures. His harmonic idiom displays a changing palette of colors marked by simultaneous cross-relations, the Lydian sharped fourth, and combinations of this sharped fourth and Mixolydian flatted seventh. Faith has denied any desire to pursue more avant-garde idioms. Earlier experiments in progressive styles met with little success, and if anything beyond the romantic exists in Faith's music, it may be the influence of Hindemith which was furthered by his studies at Indiana University with Bernhard Heiden, himself a Hindemith pupil. Traces of this influence can be discerned in the appearance of quartal/quintal harmony in many of the songs. This is seen in \"The Blackbird\" by the Victorian author William Ernest Henley composed in 1955. The accompaniment begins with broken ninth and tenth intervals supported by mildly dissonant chords; it is then followed by a hocket-like passage. This underlying texture continues through the first half of the song, contrasting with legato vocal melody. Faith's use of arch form or \"coming full circle\" reflects the influence of Brahms, whose many songs fall into this structural category. He may end with a literal repeat, a transposed portion, or only a fragment of A, and may repeat text, music, or both in the process. Arch form is also reflected in the use of dynamics. Many songs begin quietly, reach a climax in an interior section, and then end as they began. The composer's selection of poetry brings to the foreground some of literature's most famous writers in works that in this day and age have been unjustly neglected by the general public: Conrad Aiken, Edward Lear, Charles Cotton, and Christina Rossetti, to name a few. In his later years Faith began to set more diverse poets, including Moorish, Islamic and Chinese authors. That Faith is well-read is apparent not only in his choice of fine poetry to set to music, but also in his allusions to literature in many of his instrumental works. In addition, he often selects longer poems than would be considered usual for a song and writes few miniatures. The success of setting a lengthy piece of verse seems to depend upon Faith's ability to delay the listener's climactic expectations by moving through harmonic ambiguity until reaching an emotionally charged section that merits a cadence\u2014usually on open sonorities without the thirds. This event may repeat itself many times with a greater or lesser dynamic level, thereby expanding his music resources. Faith's songs adhere strictly to the rhythm dictated by the text of the poem. In fact, he simultaneously composes both melody and accompaniment by singing the text and playing the keyboard and immediately writing it down. Faith's adherence to the text rhythm results in shifting meters to accommodate phrases of varying length and text-derived rhythmic figures often provide the basis for his accompaniments For subject matter Faith prefers nature imagery over love poetry and until 1994 with his Mother Goose Rhymes, there had been only one comical song\u2014Edward Lear's \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" written in 1960. Many of Faith's settings reflect the nationality of the poet and the time period in which the poem was written. For example, Four Love Songs on Elizabethan lyrics display thin textures, balanced forms, and traditional harmonic progressions, while the Jean de La Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont songs have a French character that reveals Faith's debt to Ravel and Debussy. More recently, Faith's songs on Moorish poetry evoke an exotic, middle eastern quality. In the beautiful setting of Ben Jonson's \"To Celia\" , Faith, by stressing the poem's inherent passion, brings a fresh outlook to a lyric which had become too familiar in arrangements of the old English setting. He achieves this through an operatically conceived vocal line: high and sustained, and encompassing a range of an octave and a fifth. Two works that do not necessarily fall into specific stylistic categories, but deserve mention nonetheless, are Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Music When Soft Voices Die\" and the miniature \"Remember Me\" by the Victorian Christina Rossetti. The spontaneous quality of the Shelley song reveals the poem's great effect on Faith, who, after nearly two years without song writing , produced one of his most frequently performed pieces. The introduction's angular, twisting melody, taken later by the vocal line, lends a troubled, unsettling quality to the lyric. \"Remember Me\" was written in 1954 and is unusual for its brevity. The poet, Christina Rossetti, was an Englishwoman of Italian descent and is best known for her words to the hymns \"In the Bleak Mid-Winter\" and \"Love Came Down at Christmas.\" Faith set three more of her poems which are included in the first published volume of songs by Leyerle Publications. Many of Faith's songs have themes related to the sea, and there are a number of others in which the sea figures as an integral element in the poem. This stems from the composer\"s extreme fascination with water, having been raised near the high banks of the wide Ohio River in Evansville, Indiana. \"Sea Fever\" , one of Faith's few biographically-influenced songs, displays such a depth of emotion rare for a nineteen-year-old. It is an important early song because it established many compositional techniques to which the composer returned throughout his lyrical output. Another \"sea\" example is \"Ships\" an English translation of \"Vaisseaux, nous vous aurons aim\u00e9s\" by Jean de la Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont, the  French World War I poet killed in action in 1914. This poem was also set by Faur\u00e9 in that composer's final song cycle L'horizon chim\u00e9rique. Faith's song is scored for cello obbligato, piano, and female voice. Faith skillfully translates into music the emotions behind the words of the world's greatest authors. Although many of his songs display common characteristics, each reveals an approach that allows the poem's individuality to shine through. Performers of art song, both singers and pianists, will appreciate Faith's output, considering the variety of poems he set to music and the gracious way he treats the voice and piano in his neo-romantic/impressionistic manner. Somewhat reticent of theoretical discussions, however, Faith considers himself only to be a composer of the heart, who relies on his musical gifts to bring joy to others.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Described as a realest, scathing breakup song, its content feature the singer making a stand to tell-off an ex-lover for not appreciating her. \"I Bet\" goes through the motions of feeling bitter, by acting as a callout of her former love interest's new girlfriend, manifested in the line, \"Is that your bitch over there givin' me the ugly stare / The one with the silicone ass and the Brazilian hair\".

Just as the landscape and speech drew from elements of the Western, he wished the same of the musical style and instrumentation. However, he did not want to step too far into Western clich\u00e9s to \"cause justified derision\" and hoped the score would also draw from Chinese and other Asian musical elements. He wanted the musical elements \"mixed up, hidden, or it's as much a clich\u00e9 as the western feel. We don't want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story, but not so comfortable that we begin to be told where the story is.\" Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be \"either too airy or too sophisticated\". Universal Studios wanted a composer with experience scoring films, ruling out Firefly composer Greg Edmonson. Whedon first thought of Carter Burwell, of whom Whedon was a huge fan. However, Whedon later felt that Burwell was not the right choice because as the film changed, the needs of the score changed as well. Burwell found working on the project difficult as it required he work \"opposite\" to his usual approach. The production would have continued with Burwell, but his other obligations left him little time to compose an entirely new score for Serenity. Burwell was dropped from the project a few weeks before the scheduled February 2005 recording. David Newman was recommended by Universal's music executives when Whedon requested a composer capable of \"everything\" and \"quickly\". Whedon's instructions to Newman for the ship Serenity theme was something homemade and mournful, evoking the idea of pioneers who had only what they could carry. Whedon wished the theme to let viewers know they were now home. River Tam's theme was played on a uniquely shaped, square, antique piano that was slightly out of tune. The piano reminded Newman of River and composed a \"haunting, haunted, vaguely eastern and achingly unresolved\" theme that Whedon felt proved Newman's understanding of the film's musical needs. The score was performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony under Newman's direction. The official soundtrack was released September 27, 2005.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The second segment, \"Realm 2: Purgatory\", makes up the bulk of the film. Godard, playing himself, is waiting at the airport to depart to a European arts conference in Sarajevo. There he meets Ramos Garcia, a nationalized French Israeli, who is going to the conference as an interpreter. Ramos is looking forward to seeing his niece at the conference, Olga Brodsky, a French-speaking Jew of Russian descent. Another young woman at the conference, Judith Lerner, a journalist from Tel Aviv, visits the French ambassador and entreats him to have an on-the-record conversation about Jewish-Palestinian relations . Later she interviews the poet Mahmoud Darwish, who says that the Palestinian struggle defines Israel. In between these encounters, Judith surveys the city, and visits the Mostar bridge, where she reads Emmanuel Levinas . Meanwhile, Olga attends Godard's lecture, ostensibly about the relationship between image and text. In addition to touching on a variety of other topics, Godard explains his opposition to the common cinematic trope of \"shot/reverse shot,\" the cutting back and forth between two characters in a conversation or an exchange. Godard explains that presenting two characters in such a way, framed identically, regressively effaces their differences, and can be used as a tool of propaganda. Later Olga meets with her uncle Ramos, and discusses with him the philosophical problem of suicide. After the conference, Godard is back home, watering his garden. He gets a call from Ramos Garcia, who tells Godard about a young woman who ran into a theater and declared she had a bomb in her bag. She asked for one person to die with her for Israeli-Palestinian peace; everyone left the theater. The police came and shot her. When they opened her bag, all they found were books. Garcia tells Godard that he is sure it was Olga.

The Piano Trio in G minor of 1855 was composed after the death of his daughter Bed\u0159i\u0161ka; its style is close to that of Robert Schumann, with hints of Liszt, and the overall tone is elegiac. It was 20\u00a0years before he returned to the chamber genre with his first String Quartet. This E minor work, subtitled From My Life, was autobiographical in character, illustrating the composer's youthful enthusiasm for his art, his friendships and loves and, in a change of mood, the onset of his deafness represented by a long harmonic E in the final movement above ominous string tremolos. His second String Quartet, in D minor, written in 1882\u201383 in defiance of his doctor's orders to refrain from all musical activity, was composed in short snatches, \"a swirl of music of a person who has lost his hearing.\" It represents Smetana's frustrations with his life, but is not wholly gloomy, and includes a bright polka.

{"id": "639_114", "question": "Who was the composer of The Medium?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_53661", "text": "Bands first evolved in the military, with the Royal Artillery Band being formed in 1557, but at the turn of the 20th Century the term \"military band\" was being applied to any ensemble that incorporated woodwinds, brass and percussion, including civilian bands organised by local police, fire brigades, and even industrial firms. The majority of music played by British military bands around this time consisted of popular music and orchestral transcriptions. No serious music had yet been composed specifically for the band medium, and there was no standardised instrumentation. The lack of a set instrumentation was a major obstacle for composers, in addition to the pervasive belief that an ensemble of assorted wind instruments lacked the tonal cohesiveness to produce significant music. The Suite in E was Holst's first composition written for military band. Frederick Fennell, in Time and the Winds, observes that Holst's scoring for the work is so well conceived and organised for the band medium, that he must have had some previous experiences with groups of this kind. Indeed, Holst was himself a formidable trombonist, having already performed several seasons with the Scottish Orchestra prior to the composition of the suite. In addition, while still in college, he performed during the summers with various seaside bands, and was admittedly unsatisfied with the music that those ensembles performed. Even though these experiences likely contributed to the composition of the suite, there is no recorded commission for the work, and the reason for Holst's writing of the suite is unknown. In addition to being a serious work written for band, the orchestration of the suite was tailored to handle the inherent challenges of the military band. As there was no standardised instrumentation, Holst scored the suite for 19 instruments, with 17 remaining parts labelled \"ad lib.\", meaning they were unnecessary for performance. As most British military bands of the day employed between 20 and 30 musicians, the 19 required parts could reasonably be expected to be covered, and the remaining parts could be added or discarded as needed without disturbing the integrity of the work. The First Suite was a catalysing force that convinced many other prominent composers that serious music could be written specifically for the combination of woodwinds, percussion and brass. Works such as the English Folk Song Suite of Ralph Vaughan Williams and the William Byrd Suite of Gordon Jacob are leading examples. The piece was later arranged for brass band by Sydney Herbert, and this arrangement has been used as a contest set test piece on numerous occasions, including for the British regional brass band championships in 1970, 1983 and 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Upon waking, he hurried to a piano and played the tune to avoid forgetting it. McCartney's initial concern was that he had subconsciously plagiarised someone else's work. As he put it, \"For about a month I went round to people in the music business and asked them whether they had ever heard it before. Eventually it became like handing something in to the police. I thought if no one claimed it after a few weeks then I could have it.\" Upon being convinced that he had not copied the melody, McCartney began writing lyrics to suit it. As Lennon and McCartney were known to do at the time, a substitute working lyric, titled \"Scrambled Eggs\" , was used for the song until something more suitable was written. During the shooting of Help!, a piano was placed on one of the stages where filming was being conducted and McCartney took advantage of this opportunity to tinker with the song. Richard Lester, the director, was eventually greatly annoyed by this and lost his temper, telling McCartney to finish writing the song or he would have the piano removed. The patience of the other Beatles was also tested by McCartney's work in progress; George Harrison summed this up when he said: \"Blimey, he's always talking about that song. You'd think he was Beethoven or somebody!\" McCartney originally claimed he had written \"Yesterday\" during the Beatles' tour of France in 1964; however, the song was not released until the summer of 1965. During the intervening time, the Beatles released two albums, A Hard Day's Night and Beatles for Sale, each of which could have included \"Yesterday\". Although McCartney has never elaborated on his claims, a delay may have been due to a disagreement between McCartney and George Martin regarding the song's arrangement, or the opinion of the other Beatles who felt it did not suit their image. Lennon later indicated that the song had been around for a while before: McCartney said the breakthrough with the lyrics came during a trip to Portugal in May 1965: On 27 May 1965, McCartney and Asher flew to Lisbon for a holiday in Albufeira, Algarve, and he borrowed an acoustic guitar from Bruce Welch, in whose house they were staying, and completed the work on \"Yesterday\". The song was offered as a demo to Chris Farlowe before the Beatles recorded it, but he turned it down as he considered it \"too soft\". In a March 1967 interview with Brian Matthew, McCartney said that Lennon came up with the word that would replace \"scrambled eggs\": Yesterday.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He describes the process as expressing each memory as an individual story. Ryo composed the songs on the album around the idea of starting and ending with \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" . As such, the second track on the album is \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", and the final track \"Watashi e\" uses the same tune. For \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", Ryo was offered to compose the ending theme song to the 2009 anime series Bakemonogatari. Ryo did not want to copy the tone or style of the original Bakemonogatari novels, because he felt the author Nisio Isin would enjoy the song more if it was more original. Thus, Ryo wrote a different story after borrowing the general setting of the novels. While creating the album, Ryo thought it would be interesting if the first song on the album was the end of the story. The album's first track \"Owari e Mukau Hajimari no Uta\" was composed with the image of starting with a flashback scene, diving into the past, and once again returning to the present. For \"Hero\", Ryo was asked to compose a theme song for Shueisha's manga magazine Aoharu, a special edition version of Young Jump. The artists whose manga would be serialized in Aoharu were asked to draw \"heroines they think are cute,\" and Ryo was asked to compose the song with the same theme. Ryo thought of a boy aiming to be a manga artist as the song's protagonist, and wrote it with the concept of wanting to support those who get victimized for being otaku. Since the song reflects different points of view between the protagonist and the heroine, Nagi Yanagi switches her singing style from cool to cute sounding. Ryo describes \"Perfect Day\" with an image close to the album title and feels the song symbolizes the album. \"Perfect Day\" was born from the nuance that undoubtedly tomorrow will be a perfect day. Ryo wrote the song \"Fukush\u016b\" with the theme of anger, and was influenced by \"Snow White\" to include a line in the song describing someone being told to wear red hot iron shoes and dance. Ryo wanted a song to describe emotions that would continue past adolescence, compared to the rest of the songs on the album. Yanagi found it difficult to capture the right emotions in the song. \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\" was composed with a strong drum component as the initial concept and Ryo wanted to create a song with a fast tempo and rock and roll nuance to it; the song's tempo is over 200 beats per minute. Ryo worked in collaboration with Yanagi to write the song based on the initial demo. Ryo did not initially intend on putting \"Love & Roll\" on the album, but others in the staff convinced him to include it. For the middle of the album, Ryo wanted a lower tempo song with a different mood and composed \"Feel So Good\" based on this concept. When it was decided Ryo would compose the theme song to Type-Moon's visual novel Mah\u014dtsukai no Yoru, he first read the original novel by Kinoko Nasu the visual novel is based on to get a feel for the work. Ryo wrote \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" for the theme song, and there was not much trial and error in the composition of this song. Fireworks were an influence in the writing of \"Utakata Hanabi\" . Ryo wanted the song to reflect how fireworks, which are initially brilliant, are hard to vividly remember afterwards. \"Yoru ga Akeru yo\" was the last song on the album Ryo composed, and was born from the feeling of lying in bed being unable to sleep. Ryo was inspired by the layout of the room where he works and how when dawn is breaking, the temperature slowly starts to rise, and a school near his home starts to bustle. Since \"Sayonara Memories\" was initially released in February 2010, Ryo used that month as the song's theme. He attempted to write a song that reflected February as the time of year in Japan when people are reminded of farewells they made the previous year, as well as the time when people think about meeting others for the first time. The last song \"Watashi e\" is meant to convey perseverance through tough times. While Ryo writes all the music, an assortment of session musicians perform the songs on the album, including four guitarists and bassists, five drummers, three pianists, and a violinist. Ryo cites drummer Masayuki Muraishi as an influence in the composition of \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\"; Muraishi contributes on several songs on the album. In composing \"Feel So Good\", Ryo employed bassist Kenji Hino, son of Terumasa Hino, after he became interested in a performance of his on a TV music program. Ryo felt using strings in \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" was an essential part of the song; Crusher Kimura provides the strings for three songs on the album. Haruko Ohinata is credited for the chorus of the song \"Utakata Hanabi\".

In 1875, Nikolay Matveyevich Bernard, the editor of the St. Petersburg music magazine Nouvellist, commissioned Tchaikovsky to write 12 short piano pieces, one for each month of the year.  Bernard suggested a subtitle for each month's piece.  Tchaikovsky accepted the commission and all of Bernard's subtitles, and in the December 1875 edition of the magazine, readers were promised a new Tchaikovsky piece each month throughout 1876.  The January and February pieces were written in late 1875 and sent to Bernard in December, with a request for some feedback as to whether they were suitable, and if not, Tchaikovsky would rewrite February and ensure the remainder were in the style Bernard was after.  March, April and May appear to have been composed separately; however the remaining seven pieces were all composed at the same time and written in the same copybook, and evidence suggests they were written between 22 April and 27 May.  The orchestration of Swan Lake was finished by 22 April, leaving the composer free to focus on other music; and he left for abroad at the end of May.  This seems to put the lie to Nikolay Kashkin's published version of events, which was that each month the composer would sit down to write a single piece, but only after being reminded to do so by his valet. The epigraphs that appeared on publication of the pieces were chosen by Bernard, not by Tchaikovsky.   In 1886 the publisher P. Jurgenson acquired the rights to The Seasons and the piece has been reprinted many times. Tchaikovsky did not devote his most serious compositional efforts to these pieces; they were composed to order, and they were a way of supplementing his income.  He saw the writing of music to a commission as just as valid as writing music from his own inner inspiration; however, for the former he needed a definite plot or text, a time limit, and the promise of payment at the end.

After trying to seduce Rommel into joining again, his girlfriend, Paisley, reminds him that he's not interested. Further infuriated, everyone walks out of the cabin and J.C. takes out his anger on Paisley.

Luke finds out what happened to Rommel and his now-deceased fianc\u00e9e and informs the police. J.C., now on the verge of being a wanted man, has to hide himself in isolation. Despite Luke's warnings to let the police handle the situation, Rommel refuses to let go of what happened to his former fianc\u00e9e and wants revenge. Planning to kill J.C., he gathers a group of men to back him up, consisting of one of J.C.'s henchmen Nero , muscle-bound Big Jake, bailed out criminal Crapout, and another one of J.C.'s henchmen, Cooch .

A lot of it \u2013 the lyric and the concept \u2013 came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit.\" When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind \"Imagine\". With the combined influence of \"Cloud Piece\" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as \"a humanistic paean for the people\". Blaney wrote, \"Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential.\" Rolling Stones David Fricke commented: \"[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class.\" Lennon stated: \"'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\" He told NME: \"There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism.\" Ono described the lyrical statement of \"Imagine\" as \"just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people.\" Rolling Stone described its lyrics as \"22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself\". The original piano musical motif was created in January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions. Lennon finished composing \"Imagine\" one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session. Described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar outro begins with F, then G, before resolving on C.

It is first shown during the Blackest Night event in Green Lantern vol. 4 #52 as Sinestro, recently transformed into a White Lantern, recounts the creation of the emotional entities. Adara was created from the first act of prayer from a sentient being caught in a fierce storm. Like the other emotional entities, Adara was attracted to Earth by the Entity and it is now being hunted by Krona. An artist error shows the Sinestro Corps symbol on Atrocitus' divining ritual map. However, since Parallax had already been captured, this was more than likely supposed to be Adara. According to Atrocitus' divining ritual, Adara can be found in the northeastern United States. Adara eventually chooses for its host a 14-year-old girl from Livonia, Michigan, named Nicole Morrison. Nicole had been kidnapped and after being possessed by Adara, confronted her abductor and forgave him. Later, Saint Walker brings Hal Jordan and Larfleeze to Nicole's location. Still possessed by the hope entity, Nicole appears to retain her sense of self, stating she is able to hear the hope in her parents' hearts as well as the crowd around them. Nicole goes on to say she can sense an emptiness in Larfleeze and tells him that his parents are still alive and they miss him. She also tells Jordan that he is afraid to hope and asks him why. Before Hal can answer, the group is interrupted by the arrival of Barry Allen. After Flash and Jordan discuss Jordan's recent actions, the Indigo Tribe appears with Proselyte, who has chosen a host, and Black Hand, who appears to be brain-washed. Nicole confirms this, saying she senses no hope inside them. Tension grows about whose side the Indigo Tribe is really on. This is cut short when the mysterious figure appears again and releases Parallax, who possesses the Flash. A battle then erupts between Jordan and the Parallax-possessed Flash. While this is happening, Nicole, Saint Walker, Larfleeze, and Shane Thompson try to defeat the figure. This fails when the figure rips Parallax, Proselyte, and Adara from their hosts. Adara was later seen with Krona on Oa where it possessed one of the remaining six Guardians of the Universe. Adara was eventually free from Krona's control when the rogue Guardian was killed by Hal Jordan. Adara took refugee on the Blue Central Power Battery, and only left the battery when the cosmic entity known as Relic targeted the new home planet of the Blue Lanterns. As Adara fled it was revealed that the entity was also suffering from a strange illness like all the rest of the emotional entities. The strange illness is revealed by Relic to be the reservoir of the emotional energy that's becoming exhausted which in turn will end the universe. Adara joined the Entity, Ophidian, Ion, Proselyte and the Predator into seek out Kyle Rayner, whom they believe can locate both Relic and the reservoir in order to save the universe, even if it means sacrificing themselves. The entities take Kyle Rayner's body and flee to Ysmault where they free the Butcher from Atrocitus. The only Entity who remained unaware of their plans is Parallax, who was currently being controlled by Sinestro during the Forever Evil story arc . Eventually, Relic identifies the reservoir of the emotional spectrum as being inside the Source Wall, and heads there along with his captured light from the destroyed Corps and Batteries. Kyle manages to overcome the influence of the various entities, subduing them inside his body but not driving them out. He and the Templar Guardians find Relic at the Source Wall, and come to the same conclusion that the light used profusely was a finite resource; the only question was how to replenish it. Relic seeks to experiment on the entities inside of Kyle, with the intention of using them to replenish the source, but is stopped by a contingency of Green, Red and Indigo Lanterns, who mean to stop Relic from going any further. Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, who is now a Red Lantern, and Kyle Rayner execute a plan to drive Relic into the Source Wall where he will be trapped forever. Kyle pushes them away and breaks through the Source Wall, which had become significantly weaker with the draining of the light source, and releases the entities inside of him, who sacrifice themselves to replenish the light source and defeat Relic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The later tradition of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era, was continued into the 20th century by Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian and European classical music.

Shortly afterward Herbert Eimert introduced Stockhausen to the director of the Donaueschinger Musiktage, Heinrich Strobel, who asked if he would be willing to compose an orchestral work for the festival, for which Strobel was prepared to pay a sum of 1500 DM\u2014the largest sum of money Stockhausen had ever received for any single job up to that point in his life. Stockhausen agreed to send a two-piano reduction of the movement he had already begun to Hans Rosbaud, the conductor of the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra, which would give the premiere at Donaueschingen. In January 1952, Stockhausen moved to Paris to pursue post-graduate studies with Darius Milhaud and Olivier Messiaen. By the end of May, he had completed the orchestra work but had decided that the first movement was too melodic and motivic. Consequently, he posted the remaining two movements, now titled Spiel, to Rosbaud in place of the single movement previously sent him. At the end of September, Stockhausen travelled to Donaueschingen for rehearsals and the world premiere. Stockhausen himself played the piano part, and during the final rehearsals got the impression that Rosbaud would be glad if the piece could be considerably shortened. Consequently, Stockhausen suggested that the second movement could end at the midpoint, from where the structure is mirrored. Rosbaud was visibly relieved, and so the premiere, which took place on Saturday, 11 October, consisted only of the first movement and the first half of the second. The very large percussion section called for a variety of unconventional instruments, including a large drinking glass struck with a metal rod, which marks several important structural points. For this purpose, the curator of the Prince of F\u00fcrstenberg's museum allowed Stockhausen to choose a valuable and particularly beautiful-sounding goblet from the collection. During the performance, just before the point where they had decided to end, there was a big crescendo followed by a pause, at which point the goblet was to be struck and allowed to ring through the general pause. Unfortunately, Rosbaud gave too big a cue and the percussionist struck too hard, shattering the goblet into thousands of pieces. After this, there was one final, loud sound, and the audience erupted in scandal. Stockhausen decided he never wanted the piece ever to be performed again. However, in 1973 he rewrote the entire score, simplifying the percussion notation but leaving the structure intact. This revised score, with the complete second movement, was recorded for radio broadcast in July 1973 by the S\u00fcdwestfunk Orchester Baden-Baden under the composer's direction, and on 14 September 1975 it was publicly performed for the first time by Stockhausen conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_132", "question": "Who was the composer of Les Girls?", "ctxs": [{"id": "422_52393", "text": "France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord. French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz , Georges Bizet , Gabriel Faur\u00e9 , Charles Gounod , Jacques Offenbach , \u00c9douard Lalo , Jules Massenet and Werther ) and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3). Later came precursors of modern classical music. \u00c9rik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnop\u00e9dies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels , the ballet Les biches , the Concert champ\u00eatre for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and the Gloria for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Bol\u00e9ro . More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music. French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson fran\u00e7aise, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir D\u00e9sir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira, or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, Aliz\u00e9e and Nolwenn Leroy, electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s , electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world. Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera , the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux.

He wanted the musical elements \"mixed up, hidden, or it's as much a clich\u00e9 as the western feel. We don't want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story, but not so comfortable that we begin to be told where the story is.\" Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be \"either too airy or too sophisticated\". Universal Studios wanted a composer with experience scoring films, ruling out Firefly composer Greg Edmonson. Whedon first thought of Carter Burwell, of whom Whedon was a huge fan. However, Whedon later felt that Burwell was not the right choice because as the film changed, the needs of the score changed as well. Burwell found working on the project difficult as it required he work \"opposite\" to his usual approach.

Burwell was dropped from the project a few weeks before the scheduled February 2005 recording. David Newman was recommended by Universal's music executives when Whedon requested a composer capable of \"everything\" and \"quickly\". Whedon's instructions to Newman for the ship Serenity theme was something homemade and mournful, evoking the idea of pioneers who had only what they could carry. Whedon wished the theme to let viewers know they were now home. River Tam's theme was played on a uniquely shaped, square, antique piano that was slightly out of tune. The piano reminded Newman of River and composed a \"haunting, haunted, vaguely eastern and achingly unresolved\" theme that Whedon felt proved Newman's understanding of the film's musical needs.

Burke caused much controversy and upset among many of Ziegfeld's friends and colleagues when she sold the rights to a production on Broadway, the Ziegfeld Follies, also starring Fanny Brice, at the time the film was released in 1936, due to the fact that the show was produced by the Shubert brothers, whom Ziegfeld detested. Worse still for his associates, was that the show was a bigger success than Ziegfeld's last production of the Follies in 1931. The Ziegfeld Follies under Vincente Minnelli initially was performed in December 1935 before making its Broadway debut on January 30, 1936. It was performed in Boston and Philadelphia until the production was postponed after Brice collapsed on stage with exhaustion. When it reopened on Broadway in September 1936, five months after the release of the film, it was retitled The New Ziegfeld Follies of 1936\u20131937, and was revamped considerably, with changes to the show's humor. In 1941, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced a sequel titled Ziegfeld Girl, starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner, which recycled some film from The Great Ziegfeld.

Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in styles of various composers, or would begin playing Moonlight Sonata, smoothly transitioning into the song. The documentary film The Corporation states that Warner/Chappell charged up to 10,000 for the song to appear in a film. Because of the copyright issue, filmmakers rarely showed complete singalongs of \"Happy Birthday\" in films, either substituting the public-domain \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" or avoiding using a song entirely. Before the song became subject to copyright claims it was used freely, as in Bosko's Party, a Warner Bros. cartoon of 1932, where a chorus of animals sings it twice through. The copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" is directly referenced in a 2009 episode of the TV series iCarly, \"iMake Sam Girlier\", in which the main character as well as others begin to sing the song to Sam but are prevented from doing so by Freddie, who says the song is not public domain; \"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\" is then sung instead. The Beatles recorded \"Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club\" for the BBC's radio programme's fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, released in 2013. In a 1998 episode of the television show Sports Night, \"Intellectual Property\", character Dan Rydell sings the song to his co-anchor during a telecast, forcing his network to pay royalties, and causing him to ask his colleagues to choose public-domain songs for him to sing for their birthdays. The copyright is also referenced frequently in a Disney A.N.T. Farm episode where characters repeatedly try to sing the song, only to be stopped by others reminding them of the price. The melody of the song is also featured in The Wrong Trousers but was replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" for DVD releases. The use of the song is a problem even if it is sung in a constructed language, as a Klingon-language version was nixed in pre-production from the 7th-season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \"Parallels\", replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" in Klingon. In the Futurama episode \"I Second That Emotion\", they poke fun at the song and its copyright by making their own version with the lyrics \"What day is today? / It's 's birthday / What a day for a birthday / Let's all have some cake / .\" In The Goldbergs episode \"Han Ukkah Solo\", Erica Goldberg is challenged to write a Hanukkah song. She does, but her words are sung to the tune of \"Happy Birthday To You\". Her music teacher tells her she cannot use it because \"I'd have to pay those old ladies hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I've already spent our budget on construction paper.\" In the 30 Rock episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\", TGS cast members begin to sing the song following an announcement about the royalty fee for singing \"Happy Birthday to You\" on a television show. The cast is interrupted after the first line by a character entering the scene. In the Community episode \"Mixology Certification\", a scene starts with the last two words of the song , implying it had been sung in its entirety, before Pierce confusedly asks, \"How come we only sang the last two words?\" In the 1987 documentary Eyes on the Prize about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which \"Happy Birthday to You\" was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film. In 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of \"Happy Birthday\" in the styles of various Western classical music composers including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles. On August 5, 2013, the first anniversary of its landing on Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover celebrated its \"birthday\" when engineers at Goddard Space Flight Center used the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument to cause the rover to \"sing\" Happy Birthday on the Martian surface. During the March 6, 2014 episode of the Comedy Central series The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert attempted to sing the song in honor of the 90th anniversary of its 1924 publication, but was prevented to due to the copyright issues.

{"id": "639_147", "question": "Who was the composer of The Witch?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_39598", "text": "Composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz discovered Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West while on vacation, and saw its potential for a dramatic adaptation. However, Maguire had released the rights to Universal Pictures, which had planned to develop a live-action feature film. In 1998, Schwartz persuaded Maguire to release the rights to a stage production while also making what Schwartz called an \"impassioned plea\" to Universal producer Marc Platt to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone. The novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years surrounding Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, a misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl with emerald-green skin, who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good Witch of the South. The story is divided into five scenes based on the location and presents events, characters, and situations adapted from Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its 1939 film adaptation in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award\u2013winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year, while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, creating an original stage piece rather than a strict adaptation of Maguire's work. While the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. Holzman observed in an interview with Playbill that: \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops\u00a0\u2013 and really the whole plot\u00a0\u2013 is different onstage.\" Schwartz justified the deviation, saying: \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda\u00a0\u2013 who becomes Glinda\u00a0\u2013 and Elphaba ... the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\" Other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, cutting Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying. The book, lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings. In these developmental workshops, Kristin Chenoweth, the Tony Award\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character, joined the project as Glinda. Stephanie J. Block played Elphaba in the workshops before Idina Menzel was cast in the role in late 2000. Earlier that year, the creators recruited New York producer Stone, who began planning the Broadway production. Joe Mantello was engaged as director and Wayne Cilento as choreographer, while designer Eugene Lee created the set and visual style for the production inspired by W. W. Denslow's original illustrations for Baum's novels and Maguire's concept of the story being told through a giant clock. Costume designer Susan Hilferty created a \"twisted Edwardian\" style in building more than 200 costumes, while lighting designer Kenneth Posner used more than 800 lights to give each of the 54 distinct scenes and locations \"its own mood\". By April 2003, the show was in rehearsals. Following the out-of-town tryout in San Francisco in May and June 2003, which received mixed critical reception, the creative team made extensive changes before its transfer to Broadway. Holzman recalled: Stephen [Schwartz] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that was the thing that made the biggest difference in the life of the show. That time is what made the show work. Elements of the book were rewritten, while several songs underwent minor changes. \"Which Way is the Party?\", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, was replaced by \"Dancing Through Life\". Concern existed that Menzel's Elphaba \"got a little overshadowed\" by Chenoweth's Glinda, with San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt writing, \"Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [needs] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda\". As a result, the creative team set about making Elphaba \"more prominent\". In making the Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, \"It was clear there was work to be done and revisions to be made in the book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1887 he and other choristers from his home town participated in a concert in Lichfield Cathedral marking the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. This experience gave the boy an interest in large-scale musical effects. At the age of 12, after leaving the elementary school attached to the church, he started work .

According to a paper by Harrison Nike was once a facet of the Greek goddess Athena, who was composed of Boulaia , Ergane , and Nike . According to this theory, Nike eventually broke off from Athena to form her own distinct personality. Baudrillart, in another paper , shares a similar view that Nike was once a part of Athena and separated from her around the 5th century. However, he holds that the Athena Nike personality continued to exist alongside the distinct Nike personality. In contrast to Harrison and Baudrillart's views, E.E. Sikes believed that Nike was always a distinct personality from Athena. According to Sikes, Nike existed as an independent deity from Athena since Nike represented victory in musical, athletic, and military competitions and Athena's authority was limited to strictly military victories. Sikes postulates that the theory that Nike first originated from Athena arose from the confusion of the two goddesses at Athens where Athena Nike and Nike existed alongside each other. In Greek mythology Nike, the personification of victory, has two possible origin stories.

{"id": "639_159", "question": "Who was the composer of Messiah?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_21864", "text": "The warm reception accorded to Messiah in Dublin was not repeated in London. Indeed, even the announcement of the performance as a \"new Sacred Oratorio\" drew an anonymous commentator to ask if \"the Playhouse is a fit Temple to perform it\". Handel introduced the work at the Covent Garden theatre on 23 March 1743. Avoglio and Cibber were again the chief soloists; they were joined by the tenor John Beard, a veteran of Handel's operas, the bass Thomas Rheinhold and two other sopranos, Kitty Clive and Miss Edwards. The first performance was overshadowed by views expressed in the press that the work's subject matter was too exalted to be performed in a theatre, particularly by secular singer-actresses such as Cibber and Clive. In an attempt to deflect such sensibilities, in London Handel had avoided the name Messiah and presented the work as the \"New Sacred Oratorio\". As was his custom, Handel rearranged the music to suit his singers. He wrote a new setting of \"And lo, the angel of the Lord\" for Clive, never used subsequently. He added a tenor song for Beard: \"Their sound is gone out\", which had appeared in Jennens's original libretto but had not been in the Dublin performances. The custom of standing for the \"Hallelujah\" chorus originates from a popular belief that, at the London premiere, King George II did so, which would have obliged all to stand. There is no convincing evidence that the king was present, or that he attended any subsequent performance of Messiah; the first reference to the practice of standing appears in a letter dated 1756, three years prior to Handel's death. London's initially cool reception of Messiah led Handel to reduce the season's planned six performances to three, and not to present the work at all in 1744\u2014to the considerable annoyance of Jennens, whose relations with the composer temporarily soured. At Jennens's request, Handel made several changes in the music for the 1745 revival: \"Their sound is gone out\" became a choral piece, the soprano song \"Rejoice greatly\" was recomposed in shortened form, and the transpositions for Cibber's voice were restored to their original soprano range. Jennens wrote to Holdsworth on 30 August 1745: \"[Handel] has made a fine Entertainment of it, though not near so good as he might & ought to have done. I have with great difficulty made him correct some of the grosser faults in the composition\u00a0...\"  Handel directed two performances at Covent Garden in 1745, on 9 and 11 April, and then set the work aside for four years. The 1749 revival at Covent Garden, under the proper title of Messiah, saw the appearance of two female soloists who were henceforth closely associated with Handel's music: Giulia Frasi and Caterina Galli. In the following year these were joined by the male alto Gaetano Guadagni, for whom Handel composed new versions of \"But who may abide\" and \"Thou art gone up on high\". The year 1750 also saw the institution of the annual charity performances of Messiah at London's Foundling Hospital, which continued until Handel's death and beyond. The 1754 performance at the hospital is the first for which full details of the orchestral and vocal forces survive. The orchestra included fifteen violins, five violas, three cellos, two double-basses, four bassoons, four oboes, two trumpets, two horns and drums. In the chorus of nineteen were six trebles from the Chapel Royal; the remainder, all men, were altos, tenors and basses. Frasi, Galli and Beard led the five soloists, who were required to assist the chorus. For this performance the transposed Guadagni arias were restored to the soprano voice. By 1754 Handel was severely afflicted by the onset of blindness, and in 1755 he turned over the direction of the Messiah hospital performance to his pupil, J.C. Smith. He apparently resumed his duties in 1757 and may have continued thereafter. The final performance of the work at which Handel was present was at Covent Garden on 6 April 1759, eight days before his death.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 66% of 283 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critics' consensus is that \"Its sprawling, ambitious blend of thought-provoking narrative and eye-catching visuals will prove too unwieldy for some, but the sheer size and scope of Cloud Atlas are all but impossible to ignore.\" Review aggregator Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".

Some scholars have concluded that this was likely compiled from contemporary records of the 11th and 10th centuries BCE, but that there is no clear historical basis for determining the exact date of compilation. Other scholars believe that the Books of Samuel were substantially composed during the time of King Josiah at the end of the 7th century BCE, extended during the Babylonian exile , and substantially complete by about 550 BCE. Old Testament scholar Graeme Auld contends that further editing was done even after then\u2014the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 \"almost certainly fixes the date of the story in the Persian or Hellenistic period\" because a quarter-shekel was known to exist in Hasmonean times. The authors and editors of Samuel drew on many earlier sources, including, for their history of David, the \"history of David's rise\" and the \"succession narrative\". The Book of Chronicles, which tells the story from a different point of view, was probably composed in the period 350\u2013300 BCE, and uses Samuel and Kings as its source. Biblical evidence indicates that David's Judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him negid, meaning \"prince\" or \"chief\", rather than melek, meaning \"king\"; the biblical David sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs , and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around Hebron. Beyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. A number of scholars consider the David story to be a heroic tale similar to King Arthur's legend or Homer's epics, whereas others think that such comparisons are questionable. Others hold that the David story is a political apology\u2014an answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide. The authors and editors of Samuel and Chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote David's reign as inevitable and desirable, and for this reason there is little about David that is concrete and undisputed. Some other studies of David have been written: Baruch Halpern has pictured David as a brutal tyrant, a murderer and a lifelong vassal of Achish, the Philistine king of Gath; Steven McKenzie argues that David came from a wealthy family, was \"ambitious and ruthless\" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons. Joel S. Baden has described him as \"an ambitious, ruthless, flesh-and-blood man who achieved power by any means necessary, including murder, theft, bribery, sex, deceit, and treason. William G. Dever described him as \"a serial killer\". Jacob L. Wright has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic periods. Isaac Kalimi wrote about the tenth century BCE that: \"Almost all that one can say about King Solomon and his time is unavoidably based on the biblical texts. Nevertheless, here also one cannot always offer conclusive proof that a certain biblical passage reflects the actual historical situation in the tenth century BCE, beyond arguing that it is plausible to this or that degree.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Even by the end of the 18th century, the serfs made up two-thirds of the population of the countryside. The estates owned by the nobility were divided into districts and the royal domains, which covered about a quarter of the country, were divided into amts. One fourth of the \"knightly\" estates in Swedish Pomerania were held by Swedish nobles. The ducal estates , initially distributed among Swedish nobles and officials, became in 1654 administered by the former Swedish queen Christina. Swedish and Pomeranian nobility intermarried and became ethnically indistinguishable in the course of the 18th century. The position of Pomerania in the Swedish Realm came to depend on the talks that were opened between the Estates of Pomerania and the Government of Sweden. The talks showed few results until the Instrument of Government of 17 July 1663 could be presented, and only in 1664 did the Pomeranian Estates salute the Swedish Monarch as their new ruler. The Royal Government of Pomerania was composed of the Governor-General, who always was a Swedish Privy Councillor, as chairman and five Councillors of the Royal Government, among them the President of the Appellate Court, the Chancellor and the Castle Captain of Stettin, over inspector of the Royal Amts. When circumstances demanded, the estates, nobility, burgesses, and \u2014 until the 1690s \u2014 the clergy could be summoned for meetings of a local parliament called the Landtag. The nobility was represented by one deputy per district, and these deputies were in turn mandated by their respective district convents of nobles. The estate of the burgesses consisted of one deputy per politically franchised city, particularly Stralsund. The Landtag were presided over by a marshall . A third element of the meeting of the Estates were the five, initially ten, Landtag councillors who were appointed by the Royal Government of Pomerania following their nomination by the Estates. The Landtag councillors formed the Land Council, which mediated with the Swedish Government and oversaw the constitution. The Estates, which had exercised great authority under the Pomeranian dukes, were unable to exert any significant influence on Sweden, even though the Constitution of 1663 had provided them with a veto in as far as Pomerania was affected. Their rights of petition were however not limited, and by the privileges of King Frederick I of Sweden in 1720 they also had an explicit right to participate in legislation and taxation. The towns of Stralsund, Stettin, Greifswald and Anklam were granted autonomous jurisdiction.", "hasanswer": false}]}

L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson . The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of L\u00e9lio describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully. L\u00e9lio consists of six musical pieces presented by an actor who stands on stage in front of a curtain concealing the orchestra, chorus and solo singers. The actor's dramatic monologues explain the meaning of the music in the life of the artist.

After the first grueling workout, the women are taken away for a more fun activity: dress shopping! However, the activity is \"bitter-sweet\" for Lindsey and some of the other girls due to their current weights. The men also spend some time looking at outfits for the big day at a tuxedo shop. This shopping trip serves as motivation for many of the contestants. After everyone tries on their dream wedding gowns and tuxedos, they meet up with Sara Rue, the hostess of the show. Sara tells everyone that their first challenge will be a dancing competition and the winners will get their dream outfits.

Winslet was hand-picked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give , Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances. Cameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz' performance in the film to Goldie Hawn, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said. Jude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\" and single father raising his two daughters by himself after his wife's death. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday. Jack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend Ethan. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock . On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\" Eli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set, that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man. The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale together, although they do not share a scene.  The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair. Dustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate . According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster for a movie, saw all the light and came over to see what was going on. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it. Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers' remake of The Parent Trap , and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday. Veteran voiceover talent Hal Douglas was the narrator for the trailer, as well as other \"trailers\" that describe Amanda's situation at various points in the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Canadian rock band Rush's drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles on his own approach to percussion. King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practised together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century \" and the name of their record label, Epitaph , comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences. King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula's Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti. Members of metal bands Mudvayne, Voivod, Enslaved, Yob, Pyrrhon, and Pallbearer have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Zeni Geva, Ancestors, and Oranssi Pazuzu all cite King Crimson's influence. Other artists affected by King Crimson include video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow, jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land, folktronica exponent Juana Molina, hip hop producer RJD2, hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge, film director Hal Hartley, and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A MySpace account with the username \"Blood\" had, as of June 19, uploaded two videos; one entitled \"Vampire Taste Test \u2013 True Blood vs Human\", and one called \"BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE\". A prequel comic was handed out to attendees of the 2008 Comic-Con. The comic centers around an old vampire named Lamar, who tells the reader about how TruBlood surfaced and was discussed between many vampires before going public. At one point, Lamar wonders if TruBlood is making the world safe for vampires or from them. Several commercials featured on HBO and Facebook aired prior to the series premiere, placing vampires in ads similar to those of beer and wine. HBO produced and broadcast two documentaries to promote True Blood, entitled \"True Bloodlines\". The first, Vampire Legends, explored the earliest portrayals of vampires in legend, literature, and cinema. The second, A New Type, discusses vampire culture from Nosferatu to today's sensual, sexual creatures. To that end, the show also covered the modern vampire subculture and real-life vampire clubs. Actors and writers from True Blood appeared in the documentaries. The shows first aired on September 6, 2008, on HBO. Thousands of DVDs of the first episode were handed out to attendees of Midnight Madness, a special film festival. Blockbuster Video provided free rental of the first episode of True Blood several days before it was broadcast on HBO. On April 16, 2009, HBO released the first teaser poster for season 2.

The beverage is a carbonated blood orange-flavored drink, developed and manufactured by Omni Consumer Products, a company that specializes in defictionalizing brands from television and movies, and FMCG Manufacturing Company, a specialist manufacturer of licensed entertainment products. In June 2010, HBO held a special event at a number of movie theaters around the U.S., complete with red carpet, searchlights, and swag bags. Contest winners were invited to watch a live special, the Season 2 finale, a preview of Season 3, and a live interview on the set of True Blood with the cast and Alan Ball. HBO also began selling True Blood figural busts featuring Bill, Sookie, and Eric. Busts of other characters became available later. HBO and IDW Publishing announced at the 2010 WonderCon that they would be publishing a comic book based on the series. Alan Ball developed and wrote the comic. The first booklet, with a print run of 53,000, was released in July 2010 and soon sold out. The second issue went on sale August 18, 2010, with a second printing of the first issue going on sale August 25. Six comics were issued in the series, and they were compiled as the graphic novel All Together Now on February 15, 2011. This was the first in a series of four graphic novels released by HBO under the True Blood franchise and sold in major bookstores. Ensuing titles include Tainted Love, The French Quarter, and Ongoing. CastTrue Blood employs a broad ensemble cast composed of regular, central characters and a rotating group of impermanent supporting characters. Though the series is based in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a noticeable number of the actors are originally from outside the United States. In an interview, Ball explained that he didn't intentionally seek out \"non-American\" actors, but was willing to go anywhere he needed to in order \"to find the actor who makes the character breathe\". Ball went on to explain that, in casting, there was more of a focus on who would portray the character in a compelling way rather than who would physically resemble the characters from the book. Noting that there's a definite difference between the characters and storylines portrayed in True Blood and the ones depicted in The Southern Vampire Mysteries, he described Harris as being very understanding in terms of how her work was being reinterpreted.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was hastily rehearsed; the musicians of the Queen's Hall Orchestra first saw the complicated music only two hours before the performance, and the choir for Neptune was recruited from Holst's students at Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School. It was a comparatively intimate affair, attended by around 250 invited associates, but Holst regarded it as the public premiere, inscribing Boult's copy of the score, \"This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused the Planets to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst.\" At a Royal Philharmonic Society concert at the Queen's Hall on 27 February 1919 conducted by Boult, five of the seven movements were played in the order Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter. It was Boult's decision not to play all seven movements at this concert. Although Holst would have liked the suite to be played complete, Boult's view was that when the public were being presented with a completely new language of this kind, \"half an hour of it was as much as they could take in\". Imogen Holst recalled that  her father \"hated incomplete performances of The Planets, though on several occasions he had to agree to conduct three or four movements at Queen's Hall concerts. He particularly disliked having to finish with Jupiter, to make a 'happy ending', for, as he himself said, 'in the real world the end is not happy at all'\". At a Queen's Hall concert on 22 November 1919, Holst conducted Venus, Mercury and Jupiter. There was another incomplete public performance, in Birmingham, on 10 October 1920, with five movements , conducted by the composer. The first complete performance of the suite at a public concert was on 15 November 1920; the London Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Albert Coates. The first complete performance conducted by the composer was on 13 October 1923, with the Queen's Hall Orchestra.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On arriving at the squat Billy is met by the fiery Kim, a punk looking girl who wants to be a fashion designer. She says he can't live there as it's full, but George, her roommate, decides Billy can stay with them. George is wearing heavy makeup and what can only be described as a white toga; Billy is fascinated by him. George explains to Billy that his father is a builder so he was never happy with how George turned out, but his mother is a different story. Billy goes to the kitchen with Kim whilst George reflects on his mother's unconditional love towards him . When Billy reenters the room George kisses Billy taking him by surprise and Billy runs off. At the local night club we meet Steve Strange who is acting as bouncer. Kim, Billy, Philip, and George arrive at the club for a big night out. Billy is fascinated by the club's patrons and begins to take pictures of everyone. Steve Strange premieres his new hit record \"Fade To Grey\", but the rest of the revelers are sick of hearing the song so they pull the plug halfway through his performance. Petal turns up dealing drugs but the bouncer kicks him out after a disturbance. The audience is then introduced to another popular face on the New Romantic scene, Marilyn, a man who dresses like Marilyn Monroe . We then meet Jane who works for the magazine ID, she asks George for a quote about the New Romantic scene and he gives one. During the night we go into the men's bathroom at the club to find Leigh Bowery, an outrageous fashion designer and performance artist who traveled from his home land, Australia, to be a part of the New Romantic scene.

Back in Cell Block \"D\", a zombified Patrick enters a cell and kills the man sleeping inside. After Patrick feeds on him, the man reanimates. Michonne goes to hunt for The Governor, while Rick and Carl head out to tend to the pigs. Carl asks if he can help clear the walkers at the fence, but Rick shuts the idea down. Carl apologizes but asks for his gun back. They hear gunshots and see Lizzie and Mika Samuels run out of Cell Block \"D\", screaming for help. A horde of walkers has attacked from within and killed several people. Michonne, trapped at the prison gates with two walkers, falls over a snare and is nearly overpowered before being rescued by Carl and Maggie . Inside the cell block, the inhabitants clear out the remaining walkers, among them Patrick. They discover and eliminate another bloody-eyed walker, Charlie, in a locked cell. After finding no bites, scratches or wounds on his corpse, Dr. Caleb Subramanian recognizes the blood pouring out of Charlie's orifices as an indicator of disease, and they link Charlie's sickness with Patrick's similar bleeding. When informed by Rick of the death of Violet the pig and a sick boar discovered in the woods, Hershel notes that, pre-apocalypse, some diseases were spread by pigs and birds. They conclude that everyone in the cell block could be infected by an aggressive strain of the flu. As Carl and Maggie carry Michonne back inside, Rick approaches them and warns them to stay away from him and anyone else who may have been exposed, due to the risk of infection. Carol tends to Ryan Samuels , who was bitten during the attack. Realizing he is dying, he asks Carol to take care of Lizzie and Mika for him as if they were her own, which Carol promises to do. Lizzie and Mika say goodbye; Lizzie volunteers to stab Ryan in the head to prevent his reanimating but is unable to do so, leaving Carol to do the deed herself. The council begins quarantining those known to be sick, including Karen and another prison inhabitant, her and Tyreese's friend, David . Carol goes to talk to Mika and Lizzie as they stand by the fence. She bluntly tells Lizzie that she is weak, and in this world she cannot be. Lizzie begins crying that, \"They killed him,\" referring to a walker that she and some other children had nicknamed \"Nick\". Lizzie runs away and Mika explains that Lizzie is not weak but, \"messed up.\" Beth wraps Michonne's ankle as the two discuss the group's losses. Beth muses about what to call a parent who has lost a child, as there is no word equivalent to \"widow\" or \"orphan\"; Michonne begins to tear up but composes herself before Beth notices. Beth later asks Michonne to watch Judith, despite Michonne's reluctance. Left alone with the baby, Michonne breaks down and weeps while holding Judith close. As the survivors bury the dead, a massive group of walkers converges at a single portion of the fence. Sasha points out the carcasses of several dead rats at the fence, suggesting that someone has been feeding the walkers, which lures them in and causes them to cluster together instead of spreading out. Despite the survivors' efforts to clear them, the walkers' combined mass causes the fence to begin to give way. Rick decides to sacrifice the piglets and uses them to successfully lure the walkers away from the fence. The plan seems to take an emotional toll on Rick. Meanwhile, the prison group is able to secure the fence with tree trunks. Carol again finds Lizzie and Mika near the fence looking at walkers. Carol warns Lizzie not to identify with the walkers, but instead to take the time to grieve for, and let go of, her father. Lizzie takes her knife from Carol's hand and puts it in her belt. Carl reveals Carol's weapons teachings to his father, asking that he not confront her. Rick complies. Rick returns Carl's gun and once again begins to carry his own.

In 1805, Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C.\u00a0P.\u00a0E.\u00a0Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie. The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance his first keyboard concerto, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano. The first decades of the 19th century saw an increasing number of first publications of Bach's music: Breitkopf started publishing chorale preludes, Hoffmeister harpsichord music, and the Well-Tempered Clavier was printed concurrently by Simrock , N\u00e4geli and Hoffmeister in 1801. Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott . In 1818, Hans Georg N\u00e4geli called the Mass in B minor the greatest composition ever. Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers. When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, it is clear that he had been inspired by the then unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat. Felix Mendelssohn significantly contributed to the renewed interest in Bach's work with his 1829 Berlin performance of the St\u00a0Matthew Passion, which was instrumental in setting off what has been called the Bach Revival. The St John Passion saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 1840s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion, and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions saw their first publication in 1833. Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen \u00fcber den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter, Robert Franz, and Franz Liszt, or combined with new music such as the melody line of Charles Gounod's Ave Maria. Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner were among the composers who promoted Bach's music or wrote glowingly about it. In 1850, the  was founded to promote Bach's music. In the second half of the 19th century, the Society published a comprehensive edition of the composer's works. Also in the second half of the 19th century, Philipp Spitta published Johann Sebastian Bach, the standard work on Bach's life and music. By that time, Bach was known as the first of the three Bs in music. Throughout the 19th century, 200 books were published on Bach. By the end of the century, local Bach societies were established in several cities, and his music had been performed in all major musical centres. In Germany all throughout the century, Bach was coupled to nationalist feelings, and the composer was inscribed in a religious revival. In England, Bach was coupled to an existing revival of religious and baroque music. By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The singer intended the album to be a source of empowerment for young people; she wished she had written some of the songs before she attended high school. The album's sound was inspired by Trainor's love for throwback style records, and the music of the 1950s and 1960s eras in music. She created the album's sound by combining different musical genres, including: Caribbean, doo-wop, hip hop, soca and pop. The record was influenced by the American group Fugees. Trainor composed \"All About That Bass\" when she was an independent recording artist. She \"shopped\" the song around at various record labels and offered it to numerous artists, including Beyonc\u00e9, all of whom rejected it. Trainor, however, was signed to Epic Records by chairman L.A. Reid after she performed the song for him in February 2014. Reid suggested the song's demo should remain as the final version after additional audio mastering. \"All About That Bass\" was inspired by Bruno Mars' \"Just the Way You Are\" and The Chordettes' \"Lollipop\" . When Times Nolan Feeney asked Trainor what she wanted listeners to hear on Title, Trainor said, \"I want to help myself. I want to make sure guys take me on a date and treat me right because I didn't do that in the past. I want to love my body more. I just hope younger girls love themselves more, and younger people in general\u00a0...\" \"Dear Future Husband\" was inspired by Trainor's love of harmonies and a joke she made with her father, in which she said her future husband \"is out there somewhere, chilling\". With the track, Trainor wanted to convey that women should be treated better by their partners. \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" was a demo Trainor composed and recorded \"years ago\" that was excluded from the album's initial track listing. Trainor's uncle, however, insisted her management listen to the track. Upon hearing it, Trainor's manager started crying and said it had to appear on Title. Trainor then developed and produced the final version of \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" with a friend and sent it to American singer John Legend, who had the same management as Trainor. Legend replied, \"I love this, I want to be a part of it\", and later appeared on the track as a featured artist. Trainor felt the album's title track showcased her artistic style and said, \"I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like\u00a0\u2026 [a] totally different sound\". She described it as \"call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend and give me that title\".  \"Lips Are Movin\" was written in eight minutes; it was inspired by a situation in which she caught one of her label colleagues lying and American singer Sara Bareilles' \"Love Song\" . She altered the song's subject to infidelity so her listeners could relate to it more. At the time of the track's development, Trainor reflected on her previous romantic relationship in which she was cheated on and her then-boyfriend's dismissal of her aspirations to become a pop star.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He copied a number of melodies he had selected from an early 19th century American collection of British folk songs, and began to make notes on the film's scenario. Emerging from this was background music for a hunting scene in the film, which incorporated a sketch the composer had labeled \"Song for Bessie.\" After Bernard Herrmann replaced him in Jane Eyre, Stravinsky recycled this music into what eventually became the \"Eclogue\" to the Ode. While visiting New York City in April of that year, Serge Koussevitzky presented the composer with a commission for a new orchestral work in memory of his wife, Natalia. Stravinsky's fee would be paid by the conductor's newly established Koussevitzky Foundation. The score was completed in July 1943. Stravinsky sent the finished Ode to Koussevitzky on July 9. He described the music's first part as \"a praise to the departed,\" and its central section as a \"concert champ\u00eatre, t[hat] i[s], music at the heart of nature, the principle which [your wife] defended with such passion and which you realized so brilliantly in Tanglewood.\" Of the closing \"Epitaph\" the composer said that it was a \"headstone inscription ... which will conclude my song in memory of the departed.\" Koussevitzky replied on July 21 that he was \"deeply touched and grateful\" for the music. Two weeks before the score's debut, Stravinsky assured Koussevitzky that the score and parts he had sent for the Ode were \"carefully corrected\" by him. Nevertheless, a number of errors committed by the music copyists and the composer himself had escaped his notice. The resulting \"mild cacophony\" heard in the closing moments of its world premiere on October 8, his wife Vera noted, left Stravinsky feeling \"sad because [it] was badly played.\" Although he apologized profusely to Koussevitzky in private for his \"ridiculous inattentiveness\" in proofreading the Ode, Stravinsky never publicly acknowledged any culpability in the botched premiere.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Newman and Chaplin had a falling out near the end of the Modern Times soundtrack recording sessions, leading to Newman's angry departure. The romance theme was later given lyrics, and became the pop standard \"Smile\", first recorded by Nat King Cole. A cover of this song by Jimmy Durante was also used in the trailer for the 2019 film Joker, in which the lead character also watches scenes from a showing of Modern Times after sneaking into a movie theatre. Modern Times was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard as he performs L\u00e9o Daniderff's comical song \"Je cherche apr\u00e8s Titine\". Chaplin's version is also known as \"The Nonsense Song\", as his character sings it in gibberish. The lyrics are nonsensical but appear to contain words from French and Italian; the use of deliberately half-intelligible wording for comic effect points the way towards Adenoid Hynkel's speeches in The Great Dictator. According to film composer David Raksin, he wrote the music as a young man wanting to make a name for himself. Chaplin would sit, often in the washroom, humming tunes and telling Raksin to \"take this down\". Raksin's job was to turn the humming into a score and create timings and synchronization that fit the situations. Chaplin was a violinist and had some musical knowledge, but he was not an orchestrator and was unfamiliar with synchronization. Along with Edward B. Powell, Raksin did receive screen credit for the music arrangements. Raksin later created scores for films including Laura and The Day After.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston.

After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a \"lawsuit queen\", and alleging that \"That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life.\" She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed. In December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan who was made the subject of the song \"Brain Damage\" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1\u00a0million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey's attorney stated \"Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry\u00a0... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism.\" In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine. The lawsuit was dismissed by judge Deborah Servitto in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme.

The National People's Congress in 2018 altered the country's constitution to remove the two-term limit on holding the Presidency of China, permitting the current leader, Xi Jinping, to remain president of China for an unlimited time, earning criticism for creating dictatorial governance. The President is the titular head of state, elected by the National People's Congress. The Premier is the head of government, presiding over the State Council composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions. The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader. The incumbent premier is Li Keqiang, who is also a senior member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China's de facto top decision-making body. In 2017, Xi called on the communist party to further tighten its grip on the country, to uphold the unity of the party leadership, and achieve the \"Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation\". Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption.

David is said to have played a role in spreading Christianity on the continent, inspiring numerous place names in Brittany including Saint-Divy, Saint-Yvi and Landivy. David's life and teachings have inspired a choral work by Welsh composer Karl Jenkins, Dewi Sant. It is a seven-movement work best known for the classical crossover series Adiemus, which intersperses movements reflecting the themes of David's last sermon with those drawing from three Psalms. An oratorio by another Welsh composer Arwel Hughes, also entitled Dewi Sant, was composed in 1950. Saint David is also thought to be associated with corpse candles, lights that would warn of the imminent death of a member of the community. The story goes that David prayed for his people to have some warning of their death, so that they could prepare themselves. In a vision, David's wish was granted and told that from then on, people who lived in the land of Dewi Sant \"would be forewarned by the dim light of mysterious tapers when and where the death might be expected\".

In 1971, Peter Sander wrote and produced an animated version of The Selfish Giant for CTV in Canada. The music was by Ron Goodwin. It was nominated at the 44th Academy Awards in the Animated Short Subject category, one of only three films to receive a nomination. It was first broadcast in November that year. In the 1990s, the Australian team of composer Graeme Koehne and choreographer Graeme Murphy created a children's ballet based on The Selfish Giant. In 1992, the cartoonist P.

In the 1997 film Wilde, based on the life of the author, portions of The Selfish Giant are woven in, with Wilde and his wife telling the story to their children, the portions reflecting on his relationship with them and others: the sadness of the children who can no longer play in the giant's garden is reflected in that of Wilde's sons as their beloved father spends more time with his lovers than with them. In 2009, composer Stephen DeCesare adapted the \"Selfish Giant\" as a musical. In 2010, composer Dan Goeller wrote an orchestral interpretation of the story. That same year Chris Beatrice created new illustrations for the story.

In his mission to create a new canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses. Although a follower of Wagner's reforms of the operatic genre, which he believed would be its salvation, Smetana rejected accusations of excessive Wagnerism, claiming that he was sufficiently occupied with \"Smetanism, for that is the only honest style!\" The predominantly \"national\" character of the first four operas is tempered by the lyrical romanticism of those written later, particularly the last three, composed in the years of Smetana's deafness. The first of this final trio, The Kiss, written when Smetana was receiving painful medical treatment, is described by Newmarch as a work of serene beauty, in which tears and smiles alternate throughout the score. Smetana's librettist for \"The Kiss\" was the young feminist Eli\u0161ka Kr\u00e1snohorsk\u00e1, who also supplied the texts for his final two operas. She dominated the ailing composer, who had no say in the subject-matter, the voice types or the balance between solos, duets and ensembles. Nevertheless, critics have noted few signs of a decline in Smetana's powers in these works, while his increasing proficiency in Czech meant that his settings of the language are much superior to those of his earlier operas. Smetana's eight operas created the bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only The Bartered Bride is performed regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly became part of the repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that The Bartered Bride, while not a \"gem of the first order\", is nevertheless \"a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind.\" Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says \"lifts us off our feet with its madcap vivacity\", was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: \"The Bartered Bride was merely child's play, written straight off the reel\". In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, Dalibor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The setting of the segment \"The Blizzard\" may have been inspired by Kurosawa's personal life, since he confessed to being \"a devotee of mountain climbing\". In \"Crows\", Vincent van Gogh is portrayed by American filmmaker Martin Scorsese. The segment features Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major by Chopin. The visual effects for this segment were provided by George Lucas and his special effects group Industrial Light & Magic.

The segment, and the film as a whole, ends with an excerpt from \"In the Village\", part of the Caucasian Sketches, Suite No. 1 by the Russian composer Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov. The idea of the stone in this segment, on which passersby lay flowers, was possibly inspired by a similar stone from Kurosawa's father's home village: Near the main thoroughfare of the village stood a huge rock, and there were always cut flowers on top of it. All the children who passed by it picked wild flowers and laid them atop the stone. When I wondered why they did this and asked, the children said they didn't know. I found out later by asking one of the old men in the village. In the Battle of Boshin, a hundred years ago, someone died at that spot.

Hinoue has been Key's signature art director since Key's first game Kanon, and Na-Ga has been with Key since the production of Air working as one of the computer graphics artists to render background art used in Key's games. Due to having two art directors, character design was split between the two, though Na-Ga is responsible for the character design of the majority of the cast. Of the six heroines in the story, three were designed by each artist; Komari, Haruka, and Yuiko were designed by Hinoue while Rin, Kudryavka, and Mio were done by Na-Ga. For work on the scenario, Jun Maeda contributed along with composing some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life, and two new scenario writers to Key\u2014Y\u016bto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, it was reported that the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this does not take into account the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.

He has also been portrayed as a \"virtual ambassador\" in a campaign against smoking, employed by the Veolia Energy Services Group, and his name was used as an episode title in the TV series Lost. The multi-layered fable, styled as a children's story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed The Little Prince to be transferred into various other art forms and media, including: Vinyl record, cassette and CD: as early as 1954 several audio editions in multiple languages were created on vinyl record, cassette tape and much later as a CD, with one English version narrated by Richard Burton. Radio broadcasts: radio plays were produced in the United States, with Raymond Burr, in 1956, and most recently in the United Kingdom on BBC in a 1999 dramatization by Bonnie Greer, produced by Pam Fraser Solomon. Film and TV: the story has been created as a movie as early as 1966 in a Soviet-Lithuanian production, with its first English movie version in 1974 produced in the United States featuring Bob Fosse, who choreographed his own dance sequence as \"The Snake\", and Gene Wilder as \"The Fox\". Starting in 2010, a three-season-long animated series was made that expanded upon the book. In 2015, a major new 3D film, combining computer animation and stop motion animation, was released as The Little Prince in English and Le Petit Prince in French. In 2023, a 2D-animated series will be released. Stage: The Little Prince's popular appeal has lent itself to widespread dramatic adaptations in live stage productions at both the professional and amateur levels. It has become a staple of numerous stage companies, with dozens of productions created. Graphic novel: a new printed version of the story in comic book form, by Joann Sfar in 2008, drew widespread notice. Pop-Up Book: a new printed edition, using the original text and St. Exupery's original drawings as the basis for elaborate pop-up illustrations, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt .

Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in styles of various composers, or would begin playing Moonlight Sonata, smoothly transitioning into the song. The documentary film The Corporation states that Warner/Chappell charged up to 10,000 for the song to appear in a film. Because of the copyright issue, filmmakers rarely showed complete singalongs of \"Happy Birthday\" in films, either substituting the public-domain \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" or avoiding using a song entirely. Before the song became subject to copyright claims it was used freely, as in Bosko's Party, a Warner Bros. cartoon of 1932, where a chorus of animals sings it twice through. The copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" is directly referenced in a 2009 episode of the TV series iCarly, \"iMake Sam Girlier\", in which the main character as well as others begin to sing the song to Sam but are prevented from doing so by Freddie, who says the song is not public domain; \"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\" is then sung instead. The Beatles recorded \"Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club\" for the BBC's radio programme's fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, released in 2013. In a 1998 episode of the television show Sports Night, \"Intellectual Property\", character Dan Rydell sings the song to his co-anchor during a telecast, forcing his network to pay royalties, and causing him to ask his colleagues to choose public-domain songs for him to sing for their birthdays. The copyright is also referenced frequently in a Disney A.N.T. Farm episode where characters repeatedly try to sing the song, only to be stopped by others reminding them of the price. The melody of the song is also featured in The Wrong Trousers but was replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" for DVD releases. The use of the song is a problem even if it is sung in a constructed language, as a Klingon-language version was nixed in pre-production from the 7th-season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \"Parallels\", replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" in Klingon. In the Futurama episode \"I Second That Emotion\", they poke fun at the song and its copyright by making their own version with the lyrics \"What day is today? / It's 's birthday / What a day for a birthday / Let's all have some cake / .\" In The Goldbergs episode \"Han Ukkah Solo\", Erica Goldberg is challenged to write a Hanukkah song. She does, but her words are sung to the tune of \"Happy Birthday To You\". Her music teacher tells her she cannot use it because \"I'd have to pay those old ladies hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I've already spent our budget on construction paper.\" In the 30 Rock episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\", TGS cast members begin to sing the song following an announcement about the royalty fee for singing \"Happy Birthday to You\" on a television show. The cast is interrupted after the first line by a character entering the scene. In the Community episode \"Mixology Certification\", a scene starts with the last two words of the song , implying it had been sung in its entirety, before Pierce confusedly asks, \"How come we only sang the last two words?\" In the 1987 documentary Eyes on the Prize about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which \"Happy Birthday to You\" was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film. In 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of \"Happy Birthday\" in the styles of various Western classical music composers including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles. On August 5, 2013, the first anniversary of its landing on Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover celebrated its \"birthday\" when engineers at Goddard Space Flight Center used the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument to cause the rover to \"sing\" Happy Birthday on the Martian surface.

He continued to compose, producing a series of German Passion cantatas.

His duties included composition and the teaching of violin to the choirboys of the Salzburg cathedral. He was promoted to second violinist in 1758 and in 1763 to deputy Kapellmeister. He rose no further; others were repeatedly promoted over him to the head position of Kapellmeister. The question of whether Leopold was successful as a composer is debated. The Grove Dictionary says that as of 1756, \"Mozart was already well-known. His works circulated widely in German-speaking Europe.\" However, biographer Maynard Solomon asserts that he \"failed to make his mark as a composer\", and Alfred Einstein \"judged him to be an undistinguished composer\". Scholars agree, however, that Leopold was successful as a pedagogue. In 1755, he wrote his Versuch einer gr\u00fcndlichen Violinschule, a comprehensive treatise on violin playing. This work was published in 1756 , and went through two further German editions , as well as being translated into Dutch and French .

Among the leitmotifs of his score are a romantically dark, yet lush heroic melodical main theme for the protagonist, which is accompanied by several secondary themes. For the antagonist, rather than a fully developed theme, Goldsmith used a musical effect in horns and synthesizers imitating a howling sound, a technique that would later echo in his scores for The Ghost and the Darkness and The Edge . For the album and end credits, Jim Steinman composed the pop-song \"Original Sin\", performed by Taylor Dayne. This had originally appeared on the album of the same name, recorded by the female group Pandora's Box. Diane Warren also composed a period-style big-band piece, \"Some Kind of Mystery\", performed by Sinoa during the film's first night club scene. The Arista Records label released the soundtrack album in 1994. It featured selections from Goldsmith's score and the songs from the film, \"Original Sin\" appearing in two different versions. In 2012, Intrada released a two-CD set that features the world premiere of the entire soundtrack composed by Goldsmith, and the complete original album cut on the second disc.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Among the Trouv\u00e8res of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established. In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music. Romantic-era composers include Hector Berlioz , Charles Gounod , Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , L\u00e9o Delibes and Jules Massenet , among others. Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon. Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy , Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel . Several foreign-born composers, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin , Franz Liszt , Jacques Offenbach , Niccol\u00f2 Paganini , and Igor Stravinsky , established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris. Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourr\u00e9e to the accompaniment of the cabrette and often the vielle \u00e0 roue in the caf\u00e9s and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and caf\u00e9s. Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city. Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s. Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll. Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the caf\u00e9s of the city at night. Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord. Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine. The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967. On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf\u2014a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars. Other singers\u2014of similar style\u2014include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet. Paris has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s. The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, it gave a voice, a political and social status for many minorities.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The duo, who are fans of Casablancas' band The Strokes, presented him with an instrumental demo track intended for use on Daft Punk's next album. Casablancas responded favorably to the demo upon listening to it and subsequently agreed to provide accompanying vocals, forming the basis for what would become \"Instant Crush\". Regarding the lyrics, Casablancas recalled that Daft Punk approached him with \"the whole story\" of what the duo wanted to achieve. At one point he wondered whether the song should be called \"Summer Crush\" based on how Daft Punk described the idea. The concept involved reflecting on the childhood memory of meeting a girl, but missing the opportunity to be with her. Casablancas initially based his lyrics on this story in conjunction with writing provided by Paul Williams, but felt that the result was \"flat\". Casablancas discarded the lines in favor of ones that he spontaneously sang to fit the structure of \"Instant Crush\", and expressed that doing so conveyed Daft Punk's concept better. The song as it appears on the album was co-produced and sung by Casablancas, who also performed lead guitar. Daft Punk played additional guitar on \"Instant Crush\" as well as keyboards and synthesizers.

From January through October 2000, Unreal Tournament sold 234,451 units and earned $8.94 million in the region. The game ultimately received a \"Silver\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association , indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. By November 2001, Unreal Tournaments total sales were close to 2 million units. Upon its release, Unreal Tournament received universal acclaim from critics, earning an overall score of 92 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. Similarly, Unreal Tournament earned an overall score of 94% on the video gaming review aggregator GameRankings.  Mainstream press reviews lauded the title for its graphics, gameplay, and level design, with Computer and Video Games concluding \"Unreal Tournament is nothing short of a technical and game-playing marvel destined to hold you \u2013 as it did us \u2013 wailing with happiness and wasting far too many precious hours hammering keyboards.

Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot praised the graphics, noting: \"As good as the original Unreal looked, Unreal Tournament looks even better. The character models and skins look excellent, and there are quite a few choices to make when designing your character\". He also praised the multiplayer gameplay, weapons and level design: \"The first-person shooter genre is fiercely competitive. But Unreal Tournament rises above the rest with its solid multiplayer performance, from its good weapon balance to its great level design\". The game was similarly reviewed by GameSpy, who concluded: \"Unreal Tournament raises the bar for first person teamplay games. The mutators, bots, teams, and sheer number of maps give the game an awesome depth and replayability. This game is stuffed with content and polished until it gleams\". British magazine PC Zone was pleased with the \"very intelligent\" bots, but criticized the \"truly terrible\" music.

Computer and Video Games found the game to have an \"excellent\" single-player mode, adding that with an average AI skill the player will \"progress with little serious effort, taking a thrilling ride through spectacularly atmospheric levels and increasing numbers of opponents\". Eurogamer echoed that sentiment, and commented that the game is playable on low-end systems. Writing for GamePro, Nash Werner said the multiplayer flexibility was \"inmense\", adding that mutators like low gravity, Sniper Arena, and Chainsaw Melee \"change everything about the way deathmatch is played\". Game Revolution agreed and praised the bots and maps, although it complained that player models were not particularly varied and that the game was not \"as visually appealing as the original Unreal\". IGN stated that Unreal Tournament received the highest ever score at the time of their review, describing the game as nearly flawless. British magazine PC Gamer complimented the artificial intelligence, and its American counterpart did the same to the  game's \"gorgeous\" graphics and \"incredible\" editing tools. Computer Games Strategy Plus described the artificial intelligence as \"outstanding\", and commented that the Domination and Assault modes add interest.

With the combination of great AI, depth and variety of gameplay, and accessibility to both newbies and the hardcore, UT has shot the pulse-pounding mayhem of multiplayer shooters to new heights\". The Macintosh version of Unreal Tournament was equally praised. IGN enjoyed the \"perfect\" gameplay and multiplayer options, but criticized the high system requirements and the user interface. Nevertheless, the game was described as \"the must have title for your Mac\". Happy Puppy described the game as \"king of deathmatch\" due to its \"incredible value\" gaming and \"amazing\" variety. Inside Mac Games praised the replay value, but criticized the high system requirements. In December 1999, Unreal Tournament was inducted into the Macworld Hall of Fame. Reviewing the Dreamcast version, Gamezilla complimented the sound, but criticized the graphics and lack of a plot. Happy Puppy described the game as \"intensely fun\", but criticized the \"mediocre\" sound. Edge criticized the lack of Assault mode. The British Dreamcast Magazine was ambivalent to the port's gameplay, visuals and sounds, noting its \"blasting\" action and lack of online multiplayer. GameSpy cited both slow framerate speeds and low sound quality as problems with the Dreamcast version. Scott Steinberg of Maxim rated the game 4 out of 5 stars, labeling it as a \"stone-cold killer\" that \"runs like Carl Lewis on a Jolt Cola binge\" while noting its \"surprisingly workable\" standard game pad controls. The PlayStation 2 release did not fare as well as the PC and Dreamcast versions. GameSpy criticized the graphics of the PS2 version, saying \"Graphically, the PS2 version of Unreal Tournament seems uninspired\". Its conclusion said about sluggish gameplay, somewhat washed out colors and textures. IGN praised the replayability, and stated that the sound is faithful to the PC version. Gamezilla criticized the PlayStation 2 version's lack of multiplayer support compared to the PC version along with Game Informer, who said despite its flaws, the game \"holds its own as one of the best FPSs out there\". On the other hand, the port scored 3 out of 10 in the television show The Electric Playground , with the reviewer lauding the audio and graphics but feeling that the controls could have been better implemented: \"Control, or lack thereof, is the biggest thorn in the side of Unreal Tournament. The game simply does not play well with the Dual Shock controller. Epic has implemented a dual analog layout which sounds good in theory, but is horrid in practice. We tried to use the Dual Shock layout for a solid hour and ended up doing nothing more than walking into walls and spinning around wildly. The other Unreal Tournament contestants probably thought that our character was possessed\". In addition to receiving Eurogamer's first ever perfect score, Unreal Tournament was named by the site one of the best games of 1999. Launch editor John Bye chose the shooter as the game of the past decade and said: \"Unreal Tournament is one of the few games in the early days of Eurogamer that I kept going back to months after I'd finished reviewing it, a game that I played to unwind after a long day playing other games. Whether it was trying to break the one-minute barrier in the speed running mayhem of Assault mode, battling back and forth amongst the alleyways of Domination, or dropping shrapnel shells at people's feet with the wonderfully chunky flak cannon in a fast and furious free-for-all deathmatch, Unreal Tournament was an endless source of entertainment\". In 2004, Unreal Tournament was inducted into the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame. Unreal Tournament was a nominee for PC Gamer USs 1999 \"Best Action Game\" and \"Best Multiplayer Game\" awards, which went to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear and Team Fortress Classic, respectively. They called it \"a brilliant multiplayer game that blew its main rival Quake III away with awesome bots, graphics, game types, and online functionality\". Unreal Tournament was a finalist for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 1999 \"Action Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to Half-Life: Opposing Force. In 2011, G4tv included two maps from this game, Facing Worlds and DM-Deck 16, in its list of the \"Most Influential FPS Multiplayer Maps Ever\". In 2013, PC Gamer labeled the Flak Cannon the greatest gun in PC gaming. In 2014, Complex magazine placed Unreal Tournament as number three on its list of \"The 50 Best First Person Shooters Of All Time\", while Moviepilot placed it as number two on its list of \"The 7 Most Influential Video Games Ever\". In November 2014, Kotaku named Facing Worlds the best multiplayer map. In January 2016, Red Bull labeled Facing Worlds one of the 10 greatest FPS multiplayer levels of all time.

Although it was not as commercially successful as Bad, Dangerous and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, the album is often debated by critics between itself and Thriller as Jackson's best. According to some music journalists, it epitomized the peak of the disco era, being part of a group of landmark disco albums including Donna Summer's Bad Girls and Bee Gees' Saturday Night Fever . James Wilson-Taylor of PopBuzz believed that the album influenced artists including The Weeknd, Justin Bieber and Beyonc\u00e9. The Weeknd cited it as a major influence on his artistry, saying, \"I found my falsetto, because of Off The Wall [and] \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\"...I always use Michael [Jackson] as, first and foremost, a vocal inspiration, and Off the Wall was definitely the one that made me feel like I could sing.\" Britni Danielle of Ebony highlighted Chris Brown's \"Fine China\" for being a \"surprisingly lush and infectious tune reminiscent of Jackson's Off the Wall ['vibe']\". Regarding the comparison to Jackson's Off the Wall 'vibe', Brown himself stated \"I really wanted to kind of bring that essence of music back with that single.\" Writing for Pitchfork, Ryan Dombal said that the influence of \"I Can't Help It\" on Pharrell's \"off-kilter funk cannot be overstated\". During Sean Combs' acceptance speech for the Recording Academy's Salute to Industry Icon award at the Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Gala, where he expressed his disappointment towards the Grammy Award's due to the lack of big award wins for Black artists, Combs' spoke on Thriller being Jackson's \"revenge\" for \"not being nominated [enough] for Off the Wall\". Combs' also dedicated his award to Off the Wall. A writer of PR Newswire credits the album for \"smashing the ceiling on record sales for black artists [and] ushering in an exciting\u00a0new era of R&B-to-pop crossover airplay, chart, marketing and sales\u00a0trends not seen before in modern pop music.\" According to the same writer, {{blockquote|\"Off The Wall transcended music and entertainment altogether [to Black America].

The one-movement piano concerto was fully orchestrated by the composer, while the second and fourth movements were later orchestrated by Sergei Taneyev, Tchaikovsky's friend and fellow composer. While the first movement sketches and completed version for piano and orchestra were essentially complete, Bogatyrev found that only 81 of the 204 bars of the second movement were in Tchaikovsky's hand.  Here he utilized Tchaikovsky's piano score for the Andante for Piano and Orchestra, Taneyev's orchestration, and a very rough draft by Tchaikovsky. For the third movement, Bogatyrev followed the insistence of the composer's brother Modest that this should be a scherzo, and orchestrated a scherzo from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72 piano pieces, as well as more sketches by the composer.  Remarkably, the piece fits neatly between the second and fourth movements and even includes final chords that are echoed by the beginning of the fourth movement.

Winslet was hand-picked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give , Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances. Cameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz' performance in the film to Goldie Hawn, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said. Jude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\" and single father raising his two daughters by himself after his wife's death. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday. Jack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend Ethan. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock . On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\" Eli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set, that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man. The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale together, although they do not share a scene.  The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair. Dustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate . According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster for a movie, saw all the light and came over to see what was going on. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it. Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers' remake of The Parent Trap , and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday. Veteran voiceover talent Hal Douglas was the narrator for the trailer, as well as other \"trailers\" that describe Amanda's situation at various points in the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The first of the second book's two \"chapters\" was composed in 1956, but chapter2 was not written until 1961. The second chapter includes three sets of variable elements, which are to be arranged to make a performing version. A partial premiere of book2 was performed by the composer and Yvonne Loriod at the Wigmore Hall, London, in March 1957. This was Boulez's first appearance in the UK as a performer. The same performers gave the premiere of the complete second book, with two different versions of chapter2, in a chamber-music concert of the Donaueschinger Musiktage on Saturday, 21 October 1961.

Boulez devised scales of twelve dynamic levels , twelve durations, and\u2014from the outset\u2014ten modes of attack, each to be used in a manner analogous to a twelve-tone row. The composer explains his purpose in this work: I wanted to eradicate from my vocabulary absolutely every trace of the conventional, whether it concerned figures and phrases, or development and form; I then wanted gradually, element after element, to win back the various stages of the compositional process, in such a manner that a perfectly new synthesis might arise, a synthesis that would not be corrupted from the very outset by foreign bodies\u2014stylistic reminiscences in particular.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The 53rd Disney animated feature film, it is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Snow Queen\". The film depicts a princess who sets off on a journey alongside an iceman, his reindeer, and a snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped their kingdom in eternal winter. Frozen underwent several story treatments before being commissioned in 2011 as a screenplay by Jennifer Lee, who co-directed with Chris Buck. The film features the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana. Christophe Beck was hired to compose the film's orchestral score, while Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez wrote the songs. Frozen had its general theatrical release on November 27, 2013. It was praised for its visuals, screenplay, themes, music, and voice acting; some film critics consider Frozen to be Disney's best animated film since the studio's renaissance era. Frozen led the 86th Academy Awards season with two nominations , and received numerous accolades. During its theatrical run, the film was a significant commercial success, earning $1.280 billion in worldwide box office revenue, overtaking Toy Story 3 to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, and carried its position until it was overtaken by the remake of The Lion King in 2019.

{"id": "639_276", "question": "Who was the composer of Remember the Time?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_58353", "text": "In his own time, Bach was highly regarded amongst his colleagues, although his reputation outside of this small circle of connoisseurs was due not to his compositions , but due to his virtuosic abilities. Nevertheless, during his life, Bach received public recognition, such as the title of court composer by Augustus III of Poland and the appreciation he was shown by Frederick the Great and Hermann Karl von Keyserling. Such highly placed appreciation contrasted with the humiliations he had to cope with, for instance in Leipzig. Also in the contemporary press, Bach had his detractors, such as Johann Adolf Scheibe, suggesting he write less complex music, and his supporters, such as Johann Mattheson and Lorenz Christoph Mizler. After his death, Bach's reputation as a composer at first declined: his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging galant style. Initially, he was remembered more as a virtuoso player of the organ and as a teacher. The bulk of the music that had been printed during the composer's lifetime, at least the part that was remembered, was for the organ and the harpsichord. Thus, his reputation as a composer was initially mostly limited to his keyboard music, and that even fairly limited to its value in music education. Bach's surviving family members, who inherited a large part of his manuscripts, were not all equally concerned with preserving them, leading to considerable losses. Carl Philipp Emanuel, his second eldest son, was most active in safeguarding his father's legacy: he co-authored his father's obituary, contributed to the publication of his four-part chorales, staged some of his works, and the bulk of previously unpublished works of his father were preserved with his help. Wilhelm Friedemann, the eldest son, performed several of his father's cantatas in Halle but after becoming unemployed sold part of the large collection of his father's works he owned. Several students of the old master, such as his son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnickol, Johann Friedrich Agricola, Johann Kirnberger, and Johann Ludwig Krebs, contributed to the dissemination of his legacy. The early devotees were not all musicians; for example, in Berlin, Daniel Itzig, a high official of Frederick the Great's court, venerated Bach. His eldest daughters took lessons from Kirnberger and their sister Sara from Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, who was in Berlin from 1774 to 1784. Sara Itzig Levy became an avid collector of works by Johann Sebastian Bach and his sons and was a \"patron\" of CPE Bach. While in Leipzig, performances of Bach's church music were limited to some of his motets, and under cantor Doles some of his Passions. A new generation of Bach aficionados emerged: they studiously collected and copied his music, including some of his large-scale works such as the Mass in B minor and performed it privately. One such connoisseur was Gottfried van Swieten, a high-ranking Austrian official who was instrumental in passing Bach's legacy on to the composers of the Viennese school. Haydn owned manuscript copies of the Well-Tempered Clavier and the Mass in B minor and was influenced by Bach's music. Mozart owned a copy of one of Bach's motets, transcribed some of his instrumental works , and wrote contrapuntal music influenced by his style. Beethoven played the entire Well-Tempered Clavier by the time he was 11 and described Bach as  .", "hasanswer": false}]}

The BBC moved most of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford.  Concerts were broadcast from the Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in St Paul's Church, Bedford was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York came to St Paul's to broadcast to the UK and the world on the National Day of Prayer. BBC employees during the war included George Orwell who spent two years with the broadcaster. During his role as prime minister during the war, Winston Churchill delivered 33 major wartime speeches by radio, all of which were carried by the BBC within the UK. On 18 June 1940, French general Charles de Gaulle, in exile in London as the leader of the Free French, made a speech, broadcast by the BBC, urging the French people not to capitulate to the Nazis. In 1938, John Reith and the British government, specifically the Ministry of Information which had been set up for WWII, designed a censorship apparatus for the inevitability of war. Due to the BBC's advancements in shortwave radio technology, the corporation could broadcast across the world during the Second World War. Within Europe, the BBC European Service would gather intelligence and information regarding the current events of the war in English. Regional BBC workers, based on their regional geo-political climate, would then further censor the material their broadcasts would cover. Nothing was to be added outside the preordained news items. For example, the BBC Polish Service was heavily censored due to fears of jeopardising relations with the Soviet Union. Controversial topics, i.e. the contested Polish and Soviet border, the deportation of Polish citizens, the arrests of Polish Home Army members and the Katyn massacre, were not included in Polish broadcasts. American radio broadcasts were broadcast across Europe on BBC channels. This material also passed through the BBC's censorship office, which surveilled and edited American coverage of British affairs. By 1940, across all BBC broadcasts, music by composers from enemy nations was censored. In total, 99 German, 38 Austrian and 38 Italian composers were censored. The BBC argued that like the Italian or German languages, listeners would be irritated by the inclusion of enemy composers. Any potential broadcasters said to have pacifist, communist or fascist ideologies were not allowed on the BBC's airwaves. In 1937, a MI5 security officer was given a permanent office within the organisation. This officer would examine the files of potential political subversives and mark the files of those deemed a security risk to the organisation, blacklisting them. This was often done on spurious grounds; even so, the practice would continue and expand during the years of the Cold War.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Sometime after the age of 23, he left his hometown of Schweinfurt, performing abroad. Although secondary sources state that he performed for royal courts, no primary sources have been discovered to verify this claim. The first known performance of Darr is in April 1837 as a guitarist/vocalist in an ensemble known as the Bavaria Nature-Singers. It is known that he traveled with this ensemble in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia. According to Bone , he spent three years in St. Petersburg, Russia, from 1836 to 1839, after which he returned to Germany, where, in W\u00fcrzburg, he became the private tutor of an English family resident there named Whitbread. It is believed that he performed in Paris, and it has been verified that he performed in Berlin. In W\u00fcrzburg he met fellow-guitarist Friedrich Brand. Together they formed a duo and for a year or two, they traveled through southern Germany, performing in Munich, Weimar, and elsewhere. At Munich, Darr made the acquaintance of the Grand Duke of Bavaria's court zitherist Johann Petzmayer, who became his zither teacher. After five years of service to the Whitbread family, Darr ended his employment and in 1856 moved to Augsburg. In the last ten years of his life, Darr composed music for the guitar and zither, including songs. During this time he published many works for the zither including his famous method. In the last year of his life, Darr became depressed due to a marital engagement that was terminated, and on 2 October 1866 he committed suicide by drowning himself in the river Lech at Augsburg. Darr was a prolific composer with over 300 known compositions to his name.

He used to stand on the blue line and say to me, \"Watch, this is how everybody else does it.\" Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and into the corner and then go chasing after it. Then he'd come back and say, \"Now, this is how the smart player does it.\" He'd shoot it into the corner again, only this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over there. Who says anticipation can't be taught? Gretzky learned much about hockey from his father on a backyard rink at his home. Walter Gretzky had been an outstanding Junior B hockey player. He cultivated a love of hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to enhance their skills.  On the backyard rink, nicknamed the \"Wally Coliseum\", winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well as teammate. Walter's drills were his own invention, and were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing new to offer him: \"I'd been doing these drills since I was three. My Dad was very smart.\" In his autobiography, Gretzky describes how at practices his father would drill him on the fundamentals of smart hockey: Him: \"Where's the last place a guy looks before he passes it?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The screen fades to Cathy Palmer sitting at a typewriter, finishing up the story. She seals it in an envelope and sends it off. When Kevin , her conventional, self-centered husband, comes home, she tells him about entering a contest to write a short story following the \"Rebecca Ryan\" series of novels. Kevin is patronizing, telling her, \"The important thing, kid, is that you're doing something you like to do.\" Cathy is notified by mail that she has won the contest, including an all-expense-paid trip to Paris for two, an Award ceremony and a meeting with the author of the \"Rebecca Ryan\" novels. Kevin tries to persuade her to decline, but she goes on the trip alone. While sightseeing in Paris, her purse is snatched. Chasing the thief, she runs into a street where she is knocked down by a car. The accident leaves Cathy with amnesia; she thinks she is the detective, Rebecca Ryan. She escapes from the hospital and assumes Rebecca's dashing persona, lavish wardrobe, and residence at the H\u00f4tel de Crillon. The hotel staff are so in awe of the novels that they go along with her demands.  When she enters \"Rebecca's\" apartment, she is greeted by Alan McMann , who thinks she is a clerical assistant he has requested from an agency. Alan is the actual author of the \"Rebecca Ryan\" novels.  Cathy ignores all of the tasks he assigns her, instead believing that Alan is Rebecca's gay sidekick, Dimitri. Cathy as Rebecca is convinced that she must save Victor Marchand , the leader of the opposition party, from an assassination plot. Rebecca and Alan chase Victor around Paris in an attempt to protect him from the murder plot, with Victor instead getting injured several times from Rebecca's rescues.

The members of government are elected for a five-year term by a universal suffrage system. Uruguay is a unitary state: justice, education, health, security, foreign policy and defense are all administered nationwide. The Executive Power is exercised by the president and a cabinet of 13 ministers. The legislative power is constituted by the General Assembly, composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Representatives, consisting of 99 members representing the 19 departments, elected for a five-year term based on proportional representation; and the Chamber of Senators, consisting of 31 members, 30 of whom are elected for a five-year term by proportional representation and the vice-president, who presides over the chamber. The judicial arm is exercised by the Supreme Court, the Bench and Judges nationwide. The members of the Supreme Court are elected by the General Assembly; the members of the Bench are selected by the Supreme Court with the consent of the Senate, and the Judges are directly assigned by the Supreme Court. Uruguay adopted its current constitution in 1967. Many of its provisions were suspended in 1973, but re-established in 1985. Drawing on Switzerland and its use of the initiative, the Uruguayan Constitution also allows citizens to repeal laws or to change the constitution by popular initiative, which culminates in a nationwide referendum. This method has been used several times over the past 15 years: to confirm a law renouncing prosecution of members of the military who violated human rights during the military regime ; to stop privatization of public utilities companies; to defend pensioners' incomes; and to protect water resources. For most of Uruguay's history, the Partido Colorado has been in government. However, in the 2004 Uruguayan general election, the Broad Front won an absolute majority in Parliamentary elections, and in 2009, Jos\u00e9 Mujica of the Broad Front defeated Luis Alberto Lacalle of the Blancos to win the presidency.

{"id": "639_293", "question": "Who was the composer of The Last Days?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_76196", "text": "Ryo likes expressing human emotions in his music, so for Today Is A Beautiful Day, he wanted to combine feelings such as lifelong experiences and memories. He describes the process as expressing each memory as an individual story. Ryo composed the songs on the album around the idea of starting and ending with \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" . As such, the second track on the album is \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", and the final track \"Watashi e\" uses the same tune. For \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", Ryo was offered to compose the ending theme song to the 2009 anime series Bakemonogatari. Ryo did not want to copy the tone or style of the original Bakemonogatari novels, because he felt the author Nisio Isin would enjoy the song more if it was more original. Thus, Ryo wrote a different story after borrowing the general setting of the novels. While creating the album, Ryo thought it would be interesting if the first song on the album was the end of the story. The album's first track \"Owari e Mukau Hajimari no Uta\" was composed with the image of starting with a flashback scene, diving into the past, and once again returning to the present. For \"Hero\", Ryo was asked to compose a theme song for Shueisha's manga magazine Aoharu, a special edition version of Young Jump. The artists whose manga would be serialized in Aoharu were asked to draw \"heroines they think are cute,\" and Ryo was asked to compose the song with the same theme. Ryo thought of a boy aiming to be a manga artist as the song's protagonist, and wrote it with the concept of wanting to support those who get victimized for being otaku. Since the song reflects different points of view between the protagonist and the heroine, Nagi Yanagi switches her singing style from cool to cute sounding. Ryo describes \"Perfect Day\" with an image close to the album title and feels the song symbolizes the album. \"Perfect Day\" was born from the nuance that undoubtedly tomorrow will be a perfect day. Ryo wrote the song \"Fukush\u016b\" with the theme of anger, and was influenced by \"Snow White\" to include a line in the song describing someone being told to wear red hot iron shoes and dance. Ryo wanted a song to describe emotions that would continue past adolescence, compared to the rest of the songs on the album. Yanagi found it difficult to capture the right emotions in the song. \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\" was composed with a strong drum component as the initial concept and Ryo wanted to create a song with a fast tempo and rock and roll nuance to it; the song's tempo is over 200 beats per minute. Ryo worked in collaboration with Yanagi to write the song based on the initial demo. Ryo did not initially intend on putting \"Love & Roll\" on the album, but others in the staff convinced him to include it. For the middle of the album, Ryo wanted a lower tempo song with a different mood and composed \"Feel So Good\" based on this concept. When it was decided Ryo would compose the theme song to Type-Moon's visual novel Mah\u014dtsukai no Yoru, he first read the original novel by Kinoko Nasu the visual novel is based on to get a feel for the work. Ryo wrote \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" for the theme song, and there was not much trial and error in the composition of this song. Fireworks were an influence in the writing of \"Utakata Hanabi\" . Ryo wanted the song to reflect how fireworks, which are initially brilliant, are hard to vividly remember afterwards. \"Yoru ga Akeru yo\" was the last song on the album Ryo composed, and was born from the feeling of lying in bed being unable to sleep. Ryo was inspired by the layout of the room where he works and how when dawn is breaking, the temperature slowly starts to rise, and a school near his home starts to bustle. Since \"Sayonara Memories\" was initially released in February 2010, Ryo used that month as the song's theme. He attempted to write a song that reflected February as the time of year in Japan when people are reminded of farewells they made the previous year, as well as the time when people think about meeting others for the first time. The last song \"Watashi e\" is meant to convey perseverance through tough times. While Ryo writes all the music, an assortment of session musicians perform the songs on the album, including four guitarists and bassists, five drummers, three pianists, and a violinist. Ryo cites drummer Masayuki Muraishi as an influence in the composition of \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\"; Muraishi contributes on several songs on the album. In composing \"Feel So Good\", Ryo employed bassist Kenji Hino, son of Terumasa Hino, after he became interested in a performance of his on a TV music program. Ryo felt using strings in \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" was an essential part of the song; Crusher Kimura provides the strings for three songs on the album. Haruko Ohinata is credited for the chorus of the song \"Utakata Hanabi\". Today Is A Beautiful Day was mixed by Takeshi Hara, Yasuhisa Kataoka, Keiji Kondo, Masashi Kudo, Eiji Makino, Koji Morimoto, Okuda Supa, and Shuji Yamaguchi.

John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky welcomes them and they meet other Deltas including Daniel Simpson \"D-Day\" Day, Chapter President Robert Hoover, Eric \"Otter\" Stratton, and Otter's best friend Donald \"Boon\" Schoenstein and girlfriend Katy. Kroger and Dorfman are invited to pledge and Bluto, Delta's sergeant-at-arms, gives them their fraternity names . Dean Vernon Wormer wants to remove the Deltas who are already on probation due to various campus conduct violations and an abysmal academic standing. Invoking his emergency authority, he places Delta on \"double-secret probation\" and directs Omega president Greg Marmalard to find a method to permanently remove Delta. Various incidents further increase the Dean's and the Omegas' animosity toward the Deltas, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse belonging to Omega member and ROTC Cadet Commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer as well as Otter flirting with Marmalard's girlfriend, Mandy Pepperidge. Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming test from the trash, unaware that the Omegas have switched the mimeograph negative for the exam. The Deltas all fail and their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter.

Otter picks up four young women from the Emily Dickinson College as dates for himself and fellow Deltas by posing as Frank Lymon, the fianc\u00e9 of a college student who died in a recent kiln explosion. They stop at a roadhouse bar where The Knights are performing, ignoring its exclusively African-American clientele. A couple of hulking patrons intimidate the Deltas, who flee, abandoning their dates and damaging their car.

Due to the Deltas' dismal midterm grade, Wormer ecstatically expels them, having already notified their local draft boards that they have lost their student deferments and are now eligible for military service. After Bluto rallies the despondent Deltas with an impassioned speech, they decide to get revenge on Wormer, the Omegas, and the college at the annual homecoming parade. D-Day converts Fred's damaged car into an armored vehicle, which they conceal inside a cake-shaped breakaway float and sneak into the parade. The Deltas then sabotage all aspects of the parade and drive through the viewing stand. As chaos ensues, the futures of several of the characters are revealed: most of the Deltas become respectable professionals while the Omegas and the other adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection.

This shopping trip serves as motivation for many of the contestants. After everyone tries on their dream wedding gowns and tuxedos, they meet up with Sara Rue, the hostess of the show. Sara tells everyone that their first challenge will be a dancing competition and the winners will get their dream outfits. The couples must maintain a combined heart-rate of 225 beats per minute to start in order to stay in the competition, and each song results in a higher heart-rate requirement. Ginny and Marc are the first couple to be eliminated. After a few more minutes of intense dancing, running, and jumping jacks, all the couples were eliminated, leaving Laeresa and Stephen as the winners. The weigh-in ceremony was very similar to the weigh-ins on The Biggest Loser, however, the two couples who had the lowest percentage of weight loss immediately faced off in an elimination challenge called \"Til Death Do Us Part,\" and that their weights were reported as a combined total, not individually. Sara also revealed that at the end of the season, all of the eliminated contestants would come back and compete for a dream honeymoon vacation. When all was said and done, Dawn and Adam lost the most percentage of weight with a grand total of 7.28% lost. The two couples that ended up in the \"Til Death Do Us Part\" elimination challenge were Ginny and Marc and Lindsey and Chase. The challenge required the couples to not only keep a 200-pound weight off the ground, but bid to see how long they could do it for. Lindsey and Chase won the bid with a time of three minutes and were allowed to stay in the competition. Ginny and Marc were eliminated.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Hischak, reviews were not as exuberant as for Oklahoma! as the critics were not taken by surprise this time.  John Chapman of the Daily News termed it \"one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always\".  The New York Times's reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that \"Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who can do no wrong, have continued doing no wrong in adapting Liliom into a musical play.  Their Carousel is on the whole delightful.\" Wilella Waldorf of the New York Post, however, complained, \"Carousel seemed to us a rather long evening. The Oklahoma! formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille's ballets.  All right, go ahead and shoot!\"Suskin, Steven. Opening Night on Broadway. Schirmer Trade Books, 1990, p. 147. . Dance Magazine gave Linn plaudits for her role as Louise, stating, \"Bambi doesn't come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand\".  Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune also applauded the dancing: \"It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show.\" When the musical returned to New York in 1949, The New York Times reviewer Brooks Atkinson described Carousel as \"a conspicuously superior musical play\u00a0... Carousel, which was warmly appreciated when it opened, seems like nothing less than a masterpiece now.\"  In 1954, when Carousel was revived at City Center, Atkinson discussed the musical in his review: Carousel has no comment to make on anything of topical importance.  The theme is timeless and universal:  the devotion of two people who love each other through thick and thin, complicated in this case by the wayward personality of the man, who cannot fulfill the responsibilities he has assumed. \u00a0... Billy is a bum, but Carousel recognizes the decency of his motives and admires his independence.  There are no slick solutions in Carousel. Stephen Sondheim noted the duo's ability to take the innovations of Oklahoma! and apply them to a serious setting: \"Oklahoma! is about a picnic, Carousel is about life and death.\"  Critic Eric Bentley, on the other hand, wrote that \"the last scene of Carousel is an impertinence:  I refuse to be lectured to by a musical comedy scriptwriter on the education of children, the nature of the good life, and the contribution of the American small town to the salvation of souls.\"New York Times critic Frank Rich said of the 1992 London production: \"What is remarkable about Mr. Hytner's direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, is its ability to make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good.\"  The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier Carousel, which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s.  Clive Barnes of the New York Post called it a \"defining Carousel\u2014hard-nosed, imaginative, and exciting.\" Critic Michael Billington has commented that \"lyrically [Carousel] comes perilously close to acceptance of the inevitability of domestic violence.\" BroadwayWorld.com stated in 2013 that Carousel is now \"considered somewhat controversial in terms of its attitudes on domestic violence\" because Julie chooses to stay with Billy despite the abuse; actress Kelli O'Hara noted that the domestic violence that Julie \"chooses to deal with \u2013 is a real, existing and very complicated thing. And exploring it is an important part of healing it.\" Rodgers considered Carousel his favorite of all his musicals and wrote, \"it affects me deeply every time I see it performed\".  In 1999, Time magazine, in its \"Best of the Century\" list, named Carousel the Best Musical of the 20th century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein \"set the standards for the 20th century musical, and this show features their most beautiful score and the most skillful and affecting example of their musical storytelling\".  Hammerstein's grandson, Oscar Andrew Hammerstein, in his book about his family, suggested that the wartime situation made Carousel's ending especially poignant to its original viewers, \"Every American grieved the loss of a brother, son, father, or friend\u00a0... the audience empathized with [Billy's] all-too-human efforts to offer advice, to seek forgiveness, to complete an unfinished life, and to bid a proper good-bye from beyond the grave.\"  Author and composer Ethan Mordden agreed with that perspective: If Oklahoma! developed the moral argument for sending American boys overseas, Carousel offered consolation to those wives and mothers whose boys would only return in spirit.  The meaning lay not in the tragedy of the present, but in the hope for a future where no one walks alone.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_301", "question": "Who was the composer of Fame?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_28563", "text": "Armenian music is a mix of indigenous folk music, perhaps best-represented by Djivan Gasparyan's well-known duduk music, as well as light pop, and extensive Christian music. Instruments like the duduk, the dhol, the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music. Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music. One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Whilst under Soviet rule, Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane. The Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \"kef\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \"kef\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of \"kef music\" heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down or pop star Cher . Ruben Hakobyan is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent. In the Armenian diaspora, Armenian Revolutionary Songs are popular with the youth. These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_304", "question": "Who was the composer of Journey?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_73967", "text": "The music in Journey was composed and orchestrated by Austin Wintory, who had previously worked with Thatgamecompany on the soundtrack for Flow. Wintory worked closely on the soundtrack with sound designer Steve Johnson, as well as the programming team, so the music would dynamically tie in to both the actions of the player and to sound effects caused by nearby game objects, and feel as if it were \"unfolding in real time\". Johnson felt having short pieces of music that looped without reacting to the player would be a \"missed opportunity\", and wanted to create music that changed while still containing a composed emotional arc. Jenova Chen met with Wintory at the start of the game's development to describe his vision for the project, and Wintory left the meeting and created the core of the main theme before he reached his car, and composed and recorded the main cello theme for the soundtrack that night. He continued to work on the soundtrack for the next three years in a collaboration with the development team; he would create a track, which the team would use while creating an area in the game, and Wintory would play the section while revising the music and then send it back. Wintory spent time experimenting and discarding many ideas; while the first track, \"Nascence\", came easily, the final track, \"Apotheosis\", went through several widely varied attempts. Unlike many games, where different songs have different themes for each character or area, Wintory chose to base all the pieces on one theme which stood for the player and their journey, with cello solos especially representing the player. Wintory describes the music as \"like a big cello concerto where you are the soloist and all the rest of the instruments represent the world around you\", though he describes it as not necessarily orchestral due to the inclusion of electronic aspects. The cello begins the game as \"immersed in a sea of electronic sound\", before first emerging on its own and then merging into a full orchestra, mirroring the player's journey to the mountain. Whenever the player meets another person, harps and viola are dynamically incorporated into the music. While the game's art style is based on several different cultures, Wintory tried to remove any overt cultural influences from the music to make it \"as universal and culture-less as possible\". Tina Guo features as the cellist for the soundtrack. She is a close friend of Wintory and has performed \"Woven Variations\" with him, an eight-minute live orchestral variation on the Journey soundtrack. All the non-electronic instruments in the soundtrack were recorded with the Macedonia Radio Symphonic Orchestra in Skopje, North Macedonia. A \"Woven Variations\" performance influenced the ending of the game: at the conclusion of development, Wintory was having difficulty with the ending to \"Apotheosis\", the final track of the game, while the development team was unsure how to end the player's journey at the top of the mountain. While they were planning a large, dramatic conclusion to both, in the concert Wintory had the orchestra fall away at the end of the piece to showcase Guo's cello performance. Inspired, Wintory and the team ended \"Apotheosis\" and the game the same way, with the game world fading away to leave only the player. The soundtrack was released as an album on April 10 on iTunes and the PlayStation Network. The album is a collection of the soundtrack's \"most important\" pieces, arranged by Wintory to stand alone without the context of the player's actions. The album comprises 18 tracks and is over 58 minutes long. It features the voice of Lisbeth Scott for the final track, \"I Was Born for This\". After its release, the soundtrack reached the top 10 of the iTunes Soundtrack charts in more than 20 countries. It also reached No. 116 on the Billboard sales charts, with over 4000 units sold in its first week after release, the second-highest position of any video game music album to date. The soundtrack was released as a physical album by Sumthing Else Music Works on October 9, 2012. In 2012 Wintory released a download-only album of music on Bandcamp titled Journey Bonus Bundle, which includes variations on themes from Journey and Flow. The soundtrack itself was subsequently released on Bandcamp on June 19, 2013. An album of piano arrangements titled Transfiguration was released on May 1, 2014, on Bandcamp as both a digital and a physical album. A two-record vinyl version of the album was released in 2015. In January 2016, Wintory started a Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, in which the fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works their way through the game. The ensemble will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Later, he copied and arranged music for performance or as study material for his pupils. Some of these pieces, like \"Bist du bei mir\" , became famous before being dissociated with Bach. Bach copied and arranged Italian masters such as Vivaldi , Pergolesi and Palestrina , French masters such as Fran\u00e7ois Couperin , and, closer to home, various German masters including Telemann and Handel , and music from members of his own family. He also often copied and arranged his own music , as his music was likewise copied and arranged by others. Some of these arrangements, like the late 19th-century \"Air on the G String\", helped to popularise Bach's music. Sometimes \"who copied whom\" is not clear. For instance, Forkel mentions a Mass for double chorus among the works composed by Bach. The work was published and performed in the early 19th century, and although a score partially in Bach's handwriting exists, the work was later considered spurious. In 1950, the design of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis was to keep such works out of the main catalogue: if there was a strong association with Bach they could be listed in its appendix . Thus, for instance, the aforementioned Mass for double chorus became BWV Anh. 167. But this was far from the end of the attribution issues. For instance, Schlage doch, gew\u00fcnschte Stunde, BWV 53, was later attributed to Melchior Hoffmann. For other works, Bach's authorship was put in doubt without a generally accepted answer to the question of whether or not he composed it: the best known organ composition in the BWV catalogue, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, was indicated as one of these uncertain works in the late 20th century.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The identity, consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past, denied and kept at bay, becomes a \"self that is no self\". To heal and humanize, one must constitute it in a language, reorganize the painful events, and retell the painful memories.

Sethe, Paul D, and Baby Suggs, who all fall short of such realization, are unable to remake themselves by trying to keep their pasts at bay. The \"self\" is located in a word, defined by others.

All of the characters in Beloved face the challenge of an unmade self, composed of their \"rememories\" and defined by perceptions and language.

It is a sequel to the 1982 film Tron, whose director Steven Lisberger returned to produce. The cast includes Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprising their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley, respectively, as well as Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, James Frain, Beau Garrett and Michael Sheen. The story follows Flynn's adult son Sam, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality called \"the Grid,\" where Sam, his father, and the algorithm Quorra must stop the malevolent program Clu from invading the real world. Interest in creating a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, in and around the city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music. Tron: Legacy premiered in Tokyo on November 30, 2010 and was theatrically released in North America on December 17, 2010. Disney vigorously promoted the film across multiple media platforms, including merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews from film critics, who praised the visual effects, production design and soundtrack, but criticized the character development, cast performance and story. The film grossed $400\u00a0million during its worldwide theatrical run, making it a box office success. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Inception. Like its predecessor, Tron: Legacy has also been described as a cult film. In 2020, it was announced that a sequel was in development.", "hasanswer": false}]}

McLain also provides the voice for GLaDOS in this song, an artificial intelligence and the game's antagonist. \"Still Alive\" is sung from the perspective of GLaDOS, used as the song that runs over the game's credits. By the end of the game, Chell, the game's protagonist who has been misled and placed in life-threatening situations within the game's testing facility setting by GLaDOS, eventually defeated her. However, the song disputes this, with GLaDOS exclaiming that she was still alive and that things were a success. She also exclaims that she is still testing, and references the Combine invasion of Earth in the Half-Life series. The song itself is also present as a samba instrumental version through in-game radios at certain points in the game. Coulton was approached by two Valve designers following a concert in Seattle, Washington. They asked him if he would like to write music for the company. Coulton was a fan of Half-Life, so he immediately accepted. After discussing what they should do, he and the designers settled on Portal. By this point, a few months before the release of The Orange Box, Valve's writers had created a large amount of backstory for GLaDOS and other aspects of Portal, which Coulton used to write the lyrics. As GLaDOS grew more important to Portals story, McLain was asked to sing for the game, since she was a trained operatic soprano, given a scratch vocal version by Coulton. McLain's singing, which Coulton described as conveying \"emotion in a non-emotional way,\" was modified to sound computerized. The overall process about six weeks to complete. Coulton found it difficult to get GLaDOS' voice out of his head. Kim Swift, lead designer of Portal, explained that the song was chosen to play during the credits because they wanted to leave players feeling happy. When Coulton began work on a theme for the Portal-connected video game Lego Dimensions, he exclaimed that the song was a \"phenomenon ... out of control,\" and that the song benefited from the writing and its context in the game. He found composing the Lego Dimensions song, \"You Wouldn't Know\", easier to do once he accepted that he would not be able to make a song as big as \"Still Alive\" again.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_327", "question": "Who was the composer of The Cruise?", "ctxs": [{"id": "218_36920", "text": "In 1985, Badalamenti was composing the score for David Lynch's Blue Velvet, as well as serving as the vocal coach for the film's star, Isabella Rossellini. A key scene in Blue Velvet was intended to feature This Mortal Coil's version of \"Song to the Siren\" by Tim Buckley, but when the rights to the song proved prohibitively expensive, it was suggested that Badalamenti compose a pop song in the same style, with lyrics written by Lynch. Because the song required a vocalist with a haunting, ethereal voice, Badalamenti recommended Cruise, who had sung in a New York theater workshop Badalamenti had produced. The result of their initial collaboration was \"Mysteries of Love\", which figures prominently in Blue Velvet'''s closing scenes and gained a cult following. Badalamenti and Lynch went on to write and produce additional songs for Cruise, most of which were featured in her debut album, Floating into the Night . The album was released on 12 September 1989 by Warner Bros. Records, and charted on Billboard the following year. It also provided musical material for Lynch's Industrial Symphony No. 1, in which Cruise performed while \"floating\" from a harness dozens of feet above a stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The second, more significant project was the soundtrack to Lynch's Twin Peaks, for which Badalamenti composed the original score. The song \"Falling\", which became the orchestral theme for the television series, caused a minor sensation, winning a Grammy at the 33rd Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental. The Twin Peaks soundtrack, featuring Cruise on the songs \"Into the Night\" and \"The Nightingale\" as well as on the vocal version of \"Falling\", eventually went gold in the US, a rare feat for a television soundtrack. Cruise made a number of appearances on Twin Peaks as a singer at a local bar, and was prominently featured in both the show's landmark pilot episode and the episode where Laura Palmer's murderer is revealed, as well as in 1992's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\", the second single from Floating into the Night, was released in 1990 and was also featured in an episode of Twin Peaks along with \"The World Spins\"; in the episode, several of the main female characters are shown lip-synching to \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart.\" Cruise reinterpreted and sang the theme song for an episode of the USA Network show Psych. The episode, \"Dual Spires\", was about a secluded town full of secrets and skeletons while they investigate the murder of a girl. It aired 20 years to the day after Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed. Cruise appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 12, 1990, filling in along with Spanic Boys on short notice when scheduled performer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor refused to appear on the same show as guest host Andrew Dice Clay. Cruise performed \"Falling.\" The following year, Cruise recorded a Lynch- and Badalamenti-produced cover of the Elvis Presley song \"Summer Kisses, Winter Tears\" for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders's Until the End of the World. Afterward, Cruise maintained a relatively low profile until her second album, The Voice of Love, was released in 1993. An instrumental version of \"She Would Die for Love\" was used as the main theme for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\"She Would Die for Love\" was also covered by alternative metal band Fant\u00f4mas on their The Director's Cut album as \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\". Cruise's early collaborations with Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch were closely related to Lynch's film work, and their lyrics often reflect this. For example, \"Into the Night\" begins with the whispered words \"Now it's dark\", a line which was repeatedly spoken by Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper's character, in Blue Velvet. Lynch also photographed Cruise for the liner notes of Floating Into the Night and The Voice of Love, and created the sculptures featured on the covers of both albums. In 2017 she appeared in Part 17 of the new Twin Peaks season performing 'The World Spins'.

Metacritic ranked The Social Network third overall, following Mad Max: Fury Road and Moonlight.

During the course of a long career, Franck held teaching positions at conservatories in both Germany and in Switzerland . Although he did not reach the front rank amongst his contemporaries, he was nevertheless well respected as a concert artist and as a composer. His conservative style was influenced by Reinecke and by his friend, the Swiss composer Hans Huber . Franck was firmly in the tradition of Mendelssohn and Schumann though it's clear that he was not immune from the influence of Wagner, Grieg and Reger also.  Critics who were familiar with his compositions and his piano playing regularly lavished praised upon them. For example, the Schweizerische Musikzeitung , writing about his First Piano Trio, Op. 20, wrote: \"Powerful and full-sounding energy is shown in many works, not least in [Richard Franck's] Op.20 Piano Trio, which is a magnificent, significant composition, fresh in invention, firm and secure in its development, and mature in its expression.\" The bulk of Franck's compositions are for solo piano; however, he also wrote orchestral and vocal compositions, as well as a considerable amount of chamber music.

Principal photography took from April 16, 2007 to May 3, 2007. The filming location was Toronto, Ontario; the same place where both Saw II and Saw III were filmed. The post-production period began on 19 May. As Whannell was uninterested in writing any more Saw films, Twisted Pictures sought new writers and ideas for the fourth Saw film, making it the first film to not be written by him. An executive discovered Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton and read their script The Midnight Man. The executive thought that the duo's script could serve as a prequel to the first film, detailing a traumatic event in John Kramer's early life. However, producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules didn't want to do a prequel and dropped the idea, but the script led Dunstan and Melton to be hired to write the next three Saw films. Thomas Fenton also joined Dunstan and Melton as writer to the film, though Marek Posival was attached to write as well at one point. Stepping into the franchise was tricky for Dunstan and Melton given the serialized nature of the Saw films, but they counted with Bousman and the crew to watch over them, pitching a trilogy which would start with Saw IV and conclude in Saw VI. The duo didn't have any trouble in bringing Jigsaw back into the story despite his death in the last film, as the character had been dying since the original film, feeling that the film wouldn't feel like a Saw entry without the character on it. Once the duo was hired and showed Saw III, they begged the crew to spare Eric Matthews, who was originally depicted to be killed in the third film, but at their insistence the producers had his death scene removed from that film so they could bring him back in the fourth film. In earlier drafts, Saw IV was going to take place simultaneously as the original Saw and it would have included a scene of Agent Peter Strahm finding and entering the bathroom, moments after Adam Stanheight was left in there to die by Jigsaw. Adam would have attempted to shoot him out of panic, prompting the agent to kill him in self-defense. This was eventually changed to the film taking place simultaneously with Saw III instead. Like in previous entries, a lot of rewrites took place during the writing process, leading many unused ideas for the film to later be recycled for Saw V. In an interview with Bousman, he stated that the last work on Saw IV would happen in August to be able to have prints made. At Comic Con Intermeational 2007, it was revealed by Bousman and Burg that the MPAA had given the film an NC-17 rating. They would have to figure out whether or not to cut the film to achieve an R rating or release it as an NC-17 film, the former of which they accomplished.

The older game renders its characters by tesselation, using thousands of polygons to make up character models and decreasing the number of polygons when lesser details are required, such as drawing the object at a distance. A typical object in Sacrifice comprises 200 to 2,500\u00a0polygons. Shiny expanded the technology's application to the game's virtual world. The environment is not decorated with grass, flowers, and rocks by overlaying two-dimensional images of such objects on the terrain model. Instead, many tiny models of these terrain features litter the landscape. Objects in the game are composed of isosceles right triangles, each of which is infinitely divisible into two smaller isosceles right triangles. The array of infinite triangles derived from these divisions is stored in a binary triangle tree data structure, and the simplicity of the division and its data management algorithms frees up the graphic processor for other duties, allowing more resources to be spent on managing the level of detail. Sacrifices spell effects are composed of parametric surfaces, which also can be broken down into triangles, facilitating tessellation. In early 2000, the computer industry released the first video graphics cards capable of processing transform, clipping, and lighting instructions. With the appropriate software, these new cards took over the burden of T&L processing from the computer's processor, allowing more detailed graphics and smoother animation. Shiny capitalized on the breakthrough, spending a few weeks to rewrite a portion of Sacrifices software. Brownlow and his team refined and improved the game's graphics, increasing the number of polygons per model and setting the software to scan through scenes a few more times to determine what objects to render and how to display them. Sacrifice was acknowledged as the first game on the market to make full use of the new graphic cards . Because of the adopted technology, animation in the game was smooth, without the jerkiness associated with overstressed graphical engines. For the character models, Otero and his team eschewed conventional designs inspired by The Lord of the Rings and other fantasies. Otero's ideal was that of \"form follows function\", by which a creature's capabilities or purposes are readily apparent from its appearance. In his opinion, a creature designed to kill enemies by exploding itself would simply be a \"cartoon-ish bomb with feet\". Otero's simple designs were expanded and fleshed out in detail by Gwyn, who was also responsible for creating Eldred's model.

In 1979, a letter condemning the book was signed by six of the composer's acquaintances: Veniamin Basner, Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, Boris Tishchenko and Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg. Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer's son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. The widow Irina continues to reject the book. Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the USSR at the time as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the USSR, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich. However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the political situation in the USSR and correctly represents his father's political views, but continues to speak of the book as being \"about my father, not by him\". In 1980, after defecting from the USSR, he denied the book was his father's memoirs. Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich's signatures raised by Laurel Fay and therefore their competence in judging the book's authenticity as Shostakovich's memoirs is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited . The claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the USSR. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of Testimony and told his family that \"Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn't have written this, let alone allowed its publication. It is clearly a fabrication\". In an article written in the same year, \"The Regime and Vulgarity\", Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg , and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with the book before signing the condemnation. As a translator of Testimony, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of Testimony in his possession, and he claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich.

After a series of successful performances in London, Mendelssohn embarked on a walking tour of Scotland with his friend Karl Klingemann. On 30 July, Mendelssohn visited the ruins of Holyrood Chapel at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, where, as he related to his family in a letter, he received his initial inspiration for the piece: Alongside this description, Mendelssohn enclosed in his letter a scrap of paper with the opening bars of what would become the symphony's opening theme. A few days later Mendelssohn and his companion visited the western coast of Scotland and the island of Staffa, which in turn inspired the composer to start the Hebrides. After completing the first version of the Hebrides, Mendelssohn continued to work on his initial sketches of what would become Symphony No. 3 while touring Italy.  However, he struggled to make progress, and after 1831 set the piece aside. It is not known exactly when Mendelssohn resumed work on the symphony but he was certainly working in earnest on the piece by 1841 and completed the symphony in Berlin on 20 January 1842. It was slightly revised after early performances, excising 111 bars of material in total, and the revised version is the one almost universally performed. Although it was the fifth and final of Mendelssohn's symphonies to be completed, it was the third to be published, and has subsequently been known as Symphony No. 3.  Intriguingly, despite describing the work as his 'Scottish Symphony' to his family in 1829, by the time the work was published in 1842 Mendelssohn never publicly called attention to the symphony's Scottish inspiration, and it is debatable whether he intended the finished work to be considered 'Scottish'. Ever since the Scottish provenance became known following the composer's death, however, audiences have found it hard not to hear the piece as evoking the wild Romantic landscapes of the north - even if such picturesque associations have caused audiences to overlook the many other musical qualities of this symphony.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1805, Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C.\u00a0P.\u00a0E.\u00a0Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie. The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance his first keyboard concerto, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano. The first decades of the 19th century saw an increasing number of first publications of Bach's music: Breitkopf started publishing chorale preludes, Hoffmeister harpsichord music, and the Well-Tempered Clavier was printed concurrently by Simrock , N\u00e4geli and Hoffmeister in 1801. Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott . In 1818, Hans Georg N\u00e4geli called the Mass in B minor the greatest composition ever. Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers. When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, it is clear that he had been inspired by the then unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat. Felix Mendelssohn significantly contributed to the renewed interest in Bach's work with his 1829 Berlin performance of the St\u00a0Matthew Passion, which was instrumental in setting off what has been called the Bach Revival. The St John Passion saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 1840s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion, and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions saw their first publication in 1833. Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen \u00fcber den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter, Robert Franz, and Franz Liszt, or combined with new music such as the melody line of Charles Gounod's Ave Maria. Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner were among the composers who promoted Bach's music or wrote glowingly about it. In 1850, the  was founded to promote Bach's music. In the second half of the 19th century, the Society published a comprehensive edition of the composer's works. Also in the second half of the 19th century, Philipp Spitta published Johann Sebastian Bach, the standard work on Bach's life and music. By that time, Bach was known as the first of the three Bs in music. Throughout the 19th century, 200 books were published on Bach. By the end of the century, local Bach societies were established in several cities, and his music had been performed in all major musical centres. In Germany all throughout the century, Bach was coupled to nationalist feelings, and the composer was inscribed in a religious revival. In England, Bach was coupled to an existing revival of religious and baroque music. By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Genesis and Yes were directly influenced by the band's initial style of symphonic Mellotron rock, and many King Crimson band members were involved in other notable bands: Lake in Emerson, Lake & Palmer ; McDonald in Foreigner; Burrell in Bad Company, and Wetton in U.K. and Asia. Canadian rock band Rush's drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles on his own approach to percussion. King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practised together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century \" and the name of their record label, Epitaph , comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences. King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula's Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti. Members of metal bands Mudvayne, Voivod, Enslaved, Yob, Pyrrhon, and Pallbearer have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Zeni Geva, Ancestors, and Oranssi Pazuzu all cite King Crimson's influence. Other artists affected by King Crimson include video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow, jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land, folktronica exponent Juana Molina, hip hop producer RJD2, hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge, film director Hal Hartley, and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He wanted the musical elements \"mixed up, hidden, or it's as much a clich\u00e9 as the western feel. We don't want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story, but not so comfortable that we begin to be told where the story is.\" Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be \"either too airy or too sophisticated\". Universal Studios wanted a composer with experience scoring films, ruling out Firefly composer Greg Edmonson. Whedon first thought of Carter Burwell, of whom Whedon was a huge fan. However, Whedon later felt that Burwell was not the right choice because as the film changed, the needs of the score changed as well. Burwell found working on the project difficult as it required he work \"opposite\" to his usual approach. The production would have continued with Burwell, but his other obligations left him little time to compose an entirely new score for Serenity. Burwell was dropped from the project a few weeks before the scheduled February 2005 recording. David Newman was recommended by Universal's music executives when Whedon requested a composer capable of \"everything\" and \"quickly\". Whedon's instructions to Newman for the ship Serenity theme was something homemade and mournful, evoking the idea of pioneers who had only what they could carry. Whedon wished the theme to let viewers know they were now home. River Tam's theme was played on a uniquely shaped, square, antique piano that was slightly out of tune. The piano reminded Newman of River and composed a \"haunting, haunted, vaguely eastern and achingly unresolved\" theme that Whedon felt proved Newman's understanding of the film's musical needs.

In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union. The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. In 1999, the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone has since grown to 19 countries. The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the European Central Bank . The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability. It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks, which comprehends all EU national central banks and is controlled by its General Council, consisting of the President of the ECB, who is appointed by the European Council, the vice-president of the ECB, and the governors of the national central banks of all 27 EU member states. The European System of Financial Supervision is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the central bank. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU. To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Abhinay is the youthful son of another affluent land-owning family belonging to the same village. His parents are dead, and he is heir to his grandfather , who owns extensive farmlands and property. Abhinav is not keen on the life of a land-owner. He has grown up in the city, and wants to start a music troupe, playing the western pop music which is entirely alien to this society. It is the death anniversary of Abhinav's parents, and his grandfather performs the usual Hindu ceremonies on the riverbank, like every year. This time, after many years, Abhinav is with him. As they arrive at the riverbank, a lady who has just finished performing the same rituals is leaving. This is Swarnalatha, and when she sees a young boy with Nasser, she looks intensely at the young man. Abhinav is intrigued by her look, and after some hesitation, he leaves his grandfather and follows the lady through the village streets. A car suddenly appears and almost crashes into a distracted and careless Abhinav, but swerves away in the nick of time and hits some bushes. This incident causes great and visible trauma to Swarnalatha, who now runs homeward. Abhinav, who has fallen on his face, is unable to follow her further. He meets the driver of the car, the beautiful and strikingly modern city girl Pinky , dressed in the skimpiest clothes ever seen in an Indian village. The car having broken down, Pinky has nowhere to stay the village; Abhinav takes her home, where his grandfather invites her to stay a few days while her car is repaired. Swarnalatha is a classically trained Carnatic singer who lost her son and best friend, Vaishnavi in a bus accident. The story reopens after a period of 20 years, when Vaishnavi's son, plans to leave his business of composing jingles with a desire to start a music troupe to compose an everlasting music just like the Charminar, and with these plans returns to his home in his village. His plan irks his father Nassar who wants him to look after the ancestral lands in the village. On the day of Death Anniversary of Vaishnavi, Abhinay spots Swarnalatha, and hears her song \"Pibare Ramarasam\" in the temple. When Swarnalatha leaves the temple, Abhinay stops her, saying, \"you knew my mother\" and follows her. The duo reach the bridge when a car comes and hits Abhinay, and the car was being driven by Pinky . Swarnalatha screams and reaches her home, with the 20 years old guilt in her mind that her one step on the bridge caused the accident. Here, the Car gets some glitch and Pinky is compelled to stay for the night in the village. Next morning both Abhinay and Pinky set for Hyderabad to seek the perfect artists for the proposed troop, and they get a guitarist and a drummer Balaji Shaleen Sharma. All land up at Pinky's boutique whose environment irritates Abhinay but somehow Pinky consoles him and the practices start, with a few opportunities coming up their way, but their rock-band does not receive the respect as Abhinay had expected. After a few days Abhinay receives the violin his mother used to play when she was alive. He returns to the village to return the violin to Swarnalatha, saying that both her voice and the sound of the violin are complementary to each other and one cannot exist without one another, and invites her to sing with their troop, for which she refuses saying that she won't come to the village and returns the violin. Swarnalatha's husband asks him to bring his troop to the house on Ganesh Chaturthi day. The troop arrives on the said date and Swarnalatha starts singing \"Mahaganapathi Manasa Smarami\", but stops in between and sings the sophisticated sargam of the song, for which no compatible music could be played. That evening Abhinay again compels Swarnalatha to sing in the city, but she again refuses, and Abhinay ends the communication with the note that She owes him a lot as he is her best friend's son, after all. Next morning Abhinay's father expresses his dislike in his son's musical career in front of Swarnalatha, and at the same time Swarnalatha agrees to sing for Abhinay in the city. She starts from her house with her husband. On the way their car breaks down and they are forced to take the bus, which crosses the bridge. Swarnalatha starts screaming, stops the bus and starts running and falls ill. Both return to home and her husband reports that she cannot come for singing. Next day Swarnalatha personally calls pinky and asks her to learn Carnatic Music. Pinky learns carnatic music from Swarnalatha. After a few days Abhinay plans a concert, though for Pinky to sing but always urges Swarnalatha to come for singing, but she continues to express her reluctance because she considers the bridge as a punishment for her ambitions. One day, while driving, Pinky gets irked at the repetitive reluctance of Swarnalatha, and speeds up the car and crosses the bridge, and Swarna starts screaming, \"Stop the car! We all are going to die\". Finally Pinky stops the car and reveals that her father was drunk and was responsible for the accident. The film ends with the concert in which Swarnalatha appears and sings \"Thaaye Yashoda\" on repeated urging from Pinky, and the concert becomes a 10-week hit.

In 1979, a letter condemning the book was signed by six of the composer's acquaintances: Veniamin Basner, Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, Boris Tishchenko and Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg. Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer's son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. The widow Irina continues to reject the book. Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the USSR at the time as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the USSR, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich. However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the political situation in the USSR and correctly represents his father's political views, but continues to speak of the book as being \"about my father, not by him\". In 1980, after defecting from the USSR, he denied the book was his father's memoirs. Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich's signatures raised by Laurel Fay and therefore their competence in judging the book's authenticity as Shostakovich's memoirs is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited . The claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the USSR. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of Testimony and told his family that \"Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn't have written this, let alone allowed its publication. It is clearly a fabrication\". In an article written in the same year, \"The Regime and Vulgarity\", Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg , and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with the book before signing the condemnation. As a translator of Testimony, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of Testimony in his possession, and he claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich.

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston. Popular artists from the mid-1990s to late 2000s include Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Beyonc\u00e9.

{"id": "639_373", "question": "Who was the composer of Hotel?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_27181", "text": "Many of the sound effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York City; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie sustained bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that \"I hear everything that goes on in this dump\". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing\u00a0\u2013 an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter. Another symbolic sound is the hum of a mosquito. Although his producer insists that these parasites don't live in Los Angeles , its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey's death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she has been murdered. The high pitch of the mosquito's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the film's score. During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated. The score was composed by Carter Burwell, who has worked with the Coens since their first film. Unlike earlier projects, however\u00a0\u2013  the Irish folk tune used for Miller's Crossing and an American folk song as the basis for Raising Arizona\u00a0\u2013  Burwell wrote the music for Barton Fink without a specific inspiration. The score was released in 1996 on a compact disc, combined with the score for the Coens' film Fargo . Several songs used in the film are laden with meaning. At one point Mayhew stumbles away from Barton and Audrey, drunk. As he wanders, he hollers the folk song \"Old Black Joe\" . Composed by Stephen Foster, it tells the tale of an elderly slave preparing to join his friends in \"a better land\". Mayhew's rendition of the song coincides with his condition as an oppressed employee of Capitol Pictures, and it foreshadows Barton's own situation at the film's end. When he finishes writing his script, Barton celebrates by dancing at a United Service Organizations show. The song used in this scene is a rendition of \"Down South Camp Meeting\", a swing tune. Its lyrics state: \"Git ready / Here they come! The choir's all set\". These lines echo the title of Barton's play, Bare Ruined Choirs. As the celebration erupts into a melee, the intensity of the music increases, and the camera zooms into the cavernous hollow of a trumpet. This sequence mirrors the camera's zoom into a sink drain just before Audrey is murdered earlier in the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_374", "question": "Who was the composer of Creation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "422_52393", "text": "France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord. French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz , Georges Bizet , Gabriel Faur\u00e9 , Charles Gounod , Jacques Offenbach , \u00c9douard Lalo , Jules Massenet and Werther ) and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3). Later came precursors of modern classical music. \u00c9rik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnop\u00e9dies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels , the ballet Les biches , the Concert champ\u00eatre for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and the Gloria for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Bol\u00e9ro . More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music. French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson fran\u00e7aise, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir D\u00e9sir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira, or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, Aliz\u00e9e and Nolwenn Leroy, electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s , electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world. Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera , the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organised, the most popular being Eurock\u00e9ennes , Solidays and Rock en Seine. The F\u00eate de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French Government in 1982.

Night Shyamalan, and starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat Clark, and Charlayne Woodard. It is the first installment in the Unbreakable film series. In Unbreakable, a security guard named David Dunn survives a horrific train crash with no injuries, leading to his realization that he harbors superhuman abilities. As he begins to grapple with this discovery, he comes to the attention of disabled comic book store owner Elijah Price , who manipulates David in order to understand him. Shyamalan organized the narrative of Unbreakable to parallel a comic book's traditional three-part story structure. After settling on the origin story, Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a speculative screenplay with Willis already set to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. Filming began in April 2000 and was completed in July. Unbreakable was released on November 21, 2000. It received generally positive reviews, praise for Shyamalan's direction, screenplay, its aesthetics, the performances, the emotional weight of the story, cinematography, and the score by James Newton Howard. The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following. A realistic vision of the superhero genre, it is regarded by many as one of Shyamalan's best films and one of the best superhero films. In 2011, Time listed it as one of the top ten superhero films of all time, ranking it number four. Quentin Tarantino also included it on his list of the top 20 films released since 1992.

In 1979, a letter condemning the book was signed by six of the composer's acquaintances: Veniamin Basner, Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, Boris Tishchenko and Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg. Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer's son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. The widow Irina continues to reject the book. Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the USSR at the time as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the USSR, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich. However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the political situation in the USSR and correctly represents his father's political views, but continues to speak of the book as being \"about my father, not by him\". In 1980, after defecting from the USSR, he denied the book was his father's memoirs. Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich's signatures raised by Laurel Fay and therefore their competence in judging the book's authenticity as Shostakovich's memoirs is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited . The claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the USSR. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of Testimony and told his family that \"Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn't have written this, let alone allowed its publication. It is clearly a fabrication\". In an article written in the same year, \"The Regime and Vulgarity\", Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg , and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with the book before signing the condemnation. As a translator of Testimony, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of Testimony in his possession, and he claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich.

{"id": "639_388", "question": "Who was the composer of New Year?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_58319", "text": "Childhood Johann Sebastian Bach was born in Eisenach, the capital of the duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, in present-day Germany, on 21 March 1685 O.S. . He was the son of Johann Ambrosius Bach, the director of the town musicians, and Maria Elisabeth L\u00e4mmerhirt. He was the eighth and youngest child of Johann Ambrosius, who likely taught him violin and basic music theory. His uncles were all professional musicians, whose posts included church organists, court chamber musicians, and composers. One uncle, Johann Christoph Bach , introduced him to the organ, and an older second cousin, Johann Ludwig Bach , was a well-known composer and violinist. Bach's mother died in 1694, and his father died eight months later. The 10-year-old Bach moved in with his eldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach , the organist at St.\u00a0Michael's Church in Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. There he studied, performed, and copied music, including his own brother's, despite being forbidden to do so because scores were so valuable and private, and blank ledger paper of that type was costly. He received valuable teaching from his brother, who instructed him on the clavichord. J.\u00a0C.\u00a0Bach exposed him to the works of great composers of the day, including South German composers such as Johann Caspar Kerll, Johann Jakob Froberger and Johann Pachelbel ; North German composers; Frenchmen, such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Louis Marchand, and Marin Marais; and the Italian clavierist Girolamo Frescobaldi. Also during this time, he was taught primarily theology, Latin and Greek at the local gymnasium. By 3 April 1700, Bach and his schoolfriend Georg Erdmann\u2014who was two years Bach's elder\u2014were enrolled in the prestigious St. Michael's School in L\u00fcneburg, some two weeks' travel north of Ohrdruf. Their journey was probably undertaken mostly on foot. His two years there were critical in exposing Bach to a wider range of European culture. In addition to singing in the choir, he played the school's three-manual organ and harpsichords. He also came into contact with sons of aristocrats from northern Germany who had been sent to the nearby Ritter-Academie to prepare for careers in other disciplines. Weimar, Arnstadt, and M\u00fchlhausen In January 1703, shortly after graduating from St. Michael's and being turned down for the post of organist at Sangerhausen, Bach was appointed court musician in the chapel of Duke Johann Ernst\u00a0III in Weimar. His role there is unclear, but it probably included menial, non-musical duties. During his seven-month tenure at Weimar, his reputation as a keyboardist spread so much that he was invited to inspect the new organ and give the inaugural recital at the New Church in Arnstadt, located about  southwest of Weimar. On 14 August 1703, he became the organist at the New Church, with light duties, a relatively generous salary, and a new organ tuned in a temperament that allowed music written in a wider range of keys to be played. Despite strong family connections and a musically enthusiastic employer, tension built up between Bach and the authorities after several years in the post. Bach was dissatisfied with the standard of singers in the choir. He called one of them a \"Zippel Fagottist\" . Late one evening this student, named Geyersbach, went after Bach with a stick. Bach filed a complaint against Geyersbach with the authorities. They acquitted Geyersbach with a minor reprimand and ordered Bach to be more moderate regarding the musical qualities he expected from his students. Some months later Bach upset his employer by a prolonged absence from Arnstadt: after obtaining leave for four weeks, he was absent for around four months in 1705\u20131706 to visit the organist and composer Dieterich Buxtehude in the northern city of L\u00fcbeck. The visit to Buxtehude involved a  journey each way, reportedly on foot. In 1706, Bach applied for a post as organist at the Blasius Church in M\u00fchlhausen. As part of his application, he had a cantata performed on Easter, 24 April 1707, likely an early version of his . A month later Bach's application was accepted and he took up the post in July. The position included significantly higher remuneration, improved conditions, and a better choir. Four months after arriving at M\u00fchlhausen, Bach married Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin. Bach was able to convince the church and town government at M\u00fchlhausen to fund an expensive renovation of the organ at the Blasius Church. In 1708 Bach wrote , a festive cantata for the inauguration of the new council, which was published at the council's expense. Return to Weimar Bach left M\u00fchlhausen in 1708, returning to Weimar this time as organist and from 1714  at the ducal court, where he had an opportunity to work with a large, well-funded contingent of professional musicians. Bach and his wife moved into a house close to the ducal palace. Later the same year, their first child, Catharina Dorothea, was born, and Maria Barbara's elder, unmarried sister joined them. She remained to help run the household until her death in 1729. Three sons were also born in Weimar: Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel, and Johann Gottfried Bernhard. Johann Sebastian and Maria Barbara had three more children, who however did not live to their first birthday, including twins born in 1713. Bach's time in Weimar was the start of a sustained period of composing keyboard and orchestral works. He attained the proficiency and confidence to extend the prevailing structures and include influences from abroad. He learned to write dramatic openings and employ the dynamic rhythms and harmonic schemes found in the music of Italians such as Vivaldi, Corelli, and Torelli. Bach absorbed these stylistic aspects in part by transcribing Vivaldi's string and wind concertos for harpsichord and organ; many of these transcribed works are still regularly performed. Bach was particularly attracted to the Italian style, in which one or more solo instruments alternate section-by-section with the full orchestra throughout a movement. In Weimar, Bach continued to play and compose for the organ and perform concert music with the duke's ensemble. He also began to write the preludes and fugues which were later assembled into his monumental work The Well-Tempered Clavier , consisting of two books, each containing 24 preludes and fugues in every major and minor key. Bach also started work on the Little Organ Book in Weimar, containing traditional Lutheran chorale tunes set in complex textures. In 1713, Bach was offered a post in Halle when he advised the authorities during a renovation by Christoph Cuntzius of the main organ in the west gallery of the Market Church of Our Dear Lady. In the spring of 1714, Bach was promoted to , an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the castle church. The first three cantatas in the new series Bach composed in Weimar were , for Palm Sunday, which coincided with the Annunciation that year; , for Jubilate Sunday; and  for Pentecost. Bach's first Christmas cantata, , was premiered in 1714 or 1715. In 1717, Bach eventually fell out of favour in Weimar and, according to a translation of the court secretary's report, was jailed for almost a month before being unfavourably dismissed: \"On November\u00a06, [1717], the quondam concertmaster and organist Bach was confined to the County Judge's place of detention for too stubbornly forcing the issue of his dismissal and finally on December\u00a02 was freed from arrest with notice of his unfavourable discharge.\" K\u00f6then Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then, hired Bach to serve as his  in 1717. Prince Leopold, himself a musician, appreciated Bach's talents, paid him well and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing. The prince was a Calvinist and did not use elaborate music in his worship; accordingly, most of Bach's work from this period was secular, including the orchestral suites, cello suites, sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and Brandenburg Concertos. Bach also composed secular cantatas for the court, such as . Despite being born in the same year and only about  apart, Bach and Handel never met. In 1719, Bach made the  journey from K\u00f6then to Halle with the intention of meeting Handel; however, Handel had left the town. In 1730, Bach's oldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, travelled to Halle to invite Handel to visit the Bach family in Leipzig, but the visit did not take place. On 7 July 1720, while Bach was away in Carlsbad with Prince Leopold, Bach's wife suddenly died. The following year, he met Anna Magdalena Wilcke, a young, highly gifted soprano 16 years his junior, who performed at the court in K\u00f6then; they married on 3 December 1721. Together they had 13 children, six of whom survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica ; Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian, who both, especially Johann Christian, became significant musicians; Johanna Carolina ; and Regina Susanna . Leipzig In 1723, Bach was appointed Thomaskantor, Cantor of the St. Thomas School at the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, which provided music for four churches in the city: the St. Thomas Church and St. Nicholas Church and to a lesser extent the New Church and St. Peter's Church. This was \"the leading cantorate in Protestant Germany\", located in the mercantile city in the Electorate of Saxony, which he held for 27 years until his death. During that time he gained further prestige through honorary appointments at the courts of K\u00f6then and Weissenfels, as well as that of the Elector Frederick Augustus in Dresden. Bach frequently disagreed with his employer, Leipzig's city council, which he regarded as \"penny-pinching\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rudhraiya's daughter, Ganga, noted that Aval Appadithan help her face life in the real world. In May 2007, K.

While Bevel's drowning in the river that promised him baptism and eternal life, that promised him that he would 'count' for something, is a grotesquely humorous irony, typical of O'Connor's stories, it might be pointed out that Bevel does indeed experience an epiphany of sorts as he is swept away to his death; 'for an instant he was overcome with surprise; then, since he was moving quickly and knew that he was getting somewhere, all his fury and his fear left him.' Baptism in Christian theology has long been associated with death and detachment; in baptism we enter into the death of Christ, undergoing a 'dying to sin' and a 'dying to self.'

Henderson also wrote that \"Gaye's choice to emphasize humanity at its most charitable rather than paint bleak pictures of destruction and disillusionment is characteristic of the album that follows.\" This is immediately followed in segue flow by the second track, \"What's Happening Brother\", a song Gaye dedicated to his brother Frankie, in which Gaye wrote to explain the disillusionment of war veterans who returned to civilian life and their disconnect from pop culture. \"Flyin' High \", which took its title from a United Airlines tag, \"fly the friendly skies\", dealt with dependence on heroin. The lyric, \"I know, I'm hooked my friend, to the boy, who makes slaves out of men\", references heroin as \"boy\", which was slang for the drug. \"Save the Children\" was an emotional plea to help disadvantaged children, warning, \"who really cares/who's willing to try/to save a world/that is destined to die?\", later crying out, \"save the babies\". A truncated version of \"God Is Love\" follows \"Save the Children\" and makes references to God. \"Mercy Mercy Me \" was another emotional plea, this time for the environment.

The song featured a memorable tenor saxophone solo from Detroit music legend Wild Bill Moore. \"Right On\" was a lengthy seven-minute jam influenced by funk rock and Latin soul rhythms that focused on Gaye's own divided soul in which Gaye later pleaded in falsetto, \"if you let me, I will take you to live where love is King\" after complying that \"true love can conquer hate every time\". \"Wholy Holy\" follows \"God Is Love\" as an emotional gospel plea advising people to \"come together\" to \"proclaim love [as our] salvation\".

Among the leitmotifs of his score are a romantically dark, yet lush heroic melodical main theme for the protagonist, which is accompanied by several secondary themes. For the antagonist, rather than a fully developed theme, Goldsmith used a musical effect in horns and synthesizers imitating a howling sound, a technique that would later echo in his scores for The Ghost and the Darkness and The Edge . For the album and end credits, Jim Steinman composed the pop-song \"Original Sin\", performed by Taylor Dayne. This had originally appeared on the album of the same name, recorded by the female group Pandora's Box. Diane Warren also composed a period-style big-band piece, \"Some Kind of Mystery\", performed by Sinoa during the film's first night club scene.

After a series of successful performances in London, Mendelssohn embarked on a walking tour of Scotland with his friend Karl Klingemann. On 30 July, Mendelssohn visited the ruins of Holyrood Chapel at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, where, as he related to his family in a letter, he received his initial inspiration for the piece: Alongside this description, Mendelssohn enclosed in his letter a scrap of paper with the opening bars of what would become the symphony's opening theme. A few days later Mendelssohn and his companion visited the western coast of Scotland and the island of Staffa, which in turn inspired the composer to start the Hebrides. After completing the first version of the Hebrides, Mendelssohn continued to work on his initial sketches of what would become Symphony No. 3 while touring Italy.  However, he struggled to make progress, and after 1831 set the piece aside. It is not known exactly when Mendelssohn resumed work on the symphony but he was certainly working in earnest on the piece by 1841 and completed the symphony in Berlin on 20 January 1842. It was slightly revised after early performances, excising 111 bars of material in total, and the revised version is the one almost universally performed. Although it was the fifth and final of Mendelssohn's symphonies to be completed, it was the third to be published, and has subsequently been known as Symphony No. 3.  Intriguingly, despite describing the work as his 'Scottish Symphony' to his family in 1829, by the time the work was published in 1842 Mendelssohn never publicly called attention to the symphony's Scottish inspiration, and it is debatable whether he intended the finished work to be considered 'Scottish'. Ever since the Scottish provenance became known following the composer's death, however, audiences have found it hard not to hear the piece as evoking the wild Romantic landscapes of the north - even if such picturesque associations have caused audiences to overlook the many other musical qualities of this symphony.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Cyrus then relocated from Franklin, Tennessee to Los Angeles, California to commence work on the Disney Channel original series Hannah Montana. At the sight of her grandfather ailing from afar, Cyrus was inspired to compose \"I Miss You\".

Some scholars have concluded that this was likely compiled from contemporary records of the 11th and 10th centuries BCE, but that there is no clear historical basis for determining the exact date of compilation. Other scholars believe that the Books of Samuel were substantially composed during the time of King Josiah at the end of the 7th century BCE, extended during the Babylonian exile , and substantially complete by about 550 BCE. Old Testament scholar Graeme Auld contends that further editing was done even after then\u2014the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 \"almost certainly fixes the date of the story in the Persian or Hellenistic period\" because a quarter-shekel was known to exist in Hasmonean times. The authors and editors of Samuel drew on many earlier sources, including, for their history of David, the \"history of David's rise\" and the \"succession narrative\". The Book of Chronicles, which tells the story from a different point of view, was probably composed in the period 350\u2013300 BCE, and uses Samuel and Kings as its source. Biblical evidence indicates that David's Judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him negid, meaning \"prince\" or \"chief\", rather than melek, meaning \"king\"; the biblical David sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs , and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around Hebron. Beyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. A number of scholars consider the David story to be a heroic tale similar to King Arthur's legend or Homer's epics, whereas others think that such comparisons are questionable. Others hold that the David story is a political apology\u2014an answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide. The authors and editors of Samuel and Chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote David's reign as inevitable and desirable, and for this reason there is little about David that is concrete and undisputed. Some other studies of David have been written: Baruch Halpern has pictured David as a brutal tyrant, a murderer and a lifelong vassal of Achish, the Philistine king of Gath; Steven McKenzie argues that David came from a wealthy family, was \"ambitious and ruthless\" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons. Joel S. Baden has described him as \"an ambitious, ruthless, flesh-and-blood man who achieved power by any means necessary, including murder, theft, bribery, sex, deceit, and treason. William G. Dever described him as \"a serial killer\". Jacob L. Wright has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic periods. Isaac Kalimi wrote about the tenth century BCE that: \"Almost all that one can say about King Solomon and his time is unavoidably based on the biblical texts. Nevertheless, here also one cannot always offer conclusive proof that a certain biblical passage reflects the actual historical situation in the tenth century BCE, beyond arguing that it is plausible to this or that degree.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his mission to create a new canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses. Although a follower of Wagner's reforms of the operatic genre, which he believed would be its salvation, Smetana rejected accusations of excessive Wagnerism, claiming that he was sufficiently occupied with \"Smetanism, for that is the only honest style!\" The predominantly \"national\" character of the first four operas is tempered by the lyrical romanticism of those written later, particularly the last three, composed in the years of Smetana's deafness. The first of this final trio, The Kiss, written when Smetana was receiving painful medical treatment, is described by Newmarch as a work of serene beauty, in which tears and smiles alternate throughout the score. Smetana's librettist for \"The Kiss\" was the young feminist Eli\u0161ka Kr\u00e1snohorsk\u00e1, who also supplied the texts for his final two operas. She dominated the ailing composer, who had no say in the subject-matter, the voice types or the balance between solos, duets and ensembles. Nevertheless, critics have noted few signs of a decline in Smetana's powers in these works, while his increasing proficiency in Czech meant that his settings of the language are much superior to those of his earlier operas. Smetana's eight operas created the bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only The Bartered Bride is performed regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly became part of the repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that The Bartered Bride, while not a \"gem of the first order\", is nevertheless \"a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind.\" Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says \"lifts us off our feet with its madcap vivacity\", was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: \"The Bartered Bride was merely child's play, written straight off the reel\". In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, Dalibor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston.

There he studied, performed, and copied music, including his own brother's, despite being forbidden to do so because scores were so valuable and private, and blank ledger paper of that type was costly. He received valuable teaching from his brother, who instructed him on the clavichord. J.\u00a0C.\u00a0Bach exposed him to the works of great composers of the day, including South German composers such as Johann Caspar Kerll, Johann Jakob Froberger and Johann Pachelbel ; North German composers; Frenchmen, such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Louis Marchand, and Marin Marais; and the Italian clavierist Girolamo Frescobaldi. Also during this time, he was taught primarily theology, Latin and Greek at the local gymnasium. By 3 April 1700, Bach and his schoolfriend Georg Erdmann\u2014who was two years Bach's elder\u2014were enrolled in the prestigious St. Michael's School in L\u00fcneburg, some two weeks' travel north of Ohrdruf. Their journey was probably undertaken mostly on foot. His two years there were critical in exposing Bach to a wider range of European culture. In addition to singing in the choir, he played the school's three-manual organ and harpsichords. He also came into contact with sons of aristocrats from northern Germany who had been sent to the nearby Ritter-Academie to prepare for careers in other disciplines. Weimar, Arnstadt, and M\u00fchlhausen In January 1703, shortly after graduating from St. Michael's and being turned down for the post of organist at Sangerhausen, Bach was appointed court musician in the chapel of Duke Johann Ernst\u00a0III in Weimar. His role there is unclear, but it probably included menial, non-musical duties. During his seven-month tenure at Weimar, his reputation as a keyboardist spread so much that he was invited to inspect the new organ and give the inaugural recital at the New Church in Arnstadt, located about  southwest of Weimar. On 14 August 1703, he became the organist at the New Church, with light duties, a relatively generous salary, and a new organ tuned in a temperament that allowed music written in a wider range of keys to be played. Despite strong family connections and a musically enthusiastic employer, tension built up between Bach and the authorities after several years in the post. Bach was dissatisfied with the standard of singers in the choir. He called one of them a \"Zippel Fagottist\" . Late one evening this student, named Geyersbach, went after Bach with a stick. Bach filed a complaint against Geyersbach with the authorities. They acquitted Geyersbach with a minor reprimand and ordered Bach to be more moderate regarding the musical qualities he expected from his students. Some months later Bach upset his employer by a prolonged absence from Arnstadt: after obtaining leave for four weeks, he was absent for around four months in 1705\u20131706 to visit the organist and composer Dieterich Buxtehude in the northern city of L\u00fcbeck. The visit to Buxtehude involved a  journey each way, reportedly on foot. In 1706, Bach applied for a post as organist at the Blasius Church in M\u00fchlhausen. As part of his application, he had a cantata performed on Easter, 24 April 1707, likely an early version of his . A month later Bach's application was accepted and he took up the post in July. The position included significantly higher remuneration, improved conditions, and a better choir. Four months after arriving at M\u00fchlhausen, Bach married Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin. Bach was able to convince the church and town government at M\u00fchlhausen to fund an expensive renovation of the organ at the Blasius Church. In 1708 Bach wrote , a festive cantata for the inauguration of the new council, which was published at the council's expense. Return to Weimar Bach left M\u00fchlhausen in 1708, returning to Weimar this time as organist and from 1714  at the ducal court, where he had an opportunity to work with a large, well-funded contingent of professional musicians. Bach and his wife moved into a house close to the ducal palace. Later the same year, their first child, Catharina Dorothea, was born, and Maria Barbara's elder, unmarried sister joined them. She remained to help run the household until her death in 1729. Three sons were also born in Weimar: Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel, and Johann Gottfried Bernhard. Johann Sebastian and Maria Barbara had three more children, who however did not live to their first birthday, including twins born in 1713. Bach's time in Weimar was the start of a sustained period of composing keyboard and orchestral works. He attained the proficiency and confidence to extend the prevailing structures and include influences from abroad. He learned to write dramatic openings and employ the dynamic rhythms and harmonic schemes found in the music of Italians such as Vivaldi, Corelli, and Torelli. Bach absorbed these stylistic aspects in part by transcribing Vivaldi's string and wind concertos for harpsichord and organ; many of these transcribed works are still regularly performed. Bach was particularly attracted to the Italian style, in which one or more solo instruments alternate section-by-section with the full orchestra throughout a movement. In Weimar, Bach continued to play and compose for the organ and perform concert music with the duke's ensemble. He also began to write the preludes and fugues which were later assembled into his monumental work The Well-Tempered Clavier , consisting of two books, each containing 24 preludes and fugues in every major and minor key. Bach also started work on the Little Organ Book in Weimar, containing traditional Lutheran chorale tunes set in complex textures. In 1713, Bach was offered a post in Halle when he advised the authorities during a renovation by Christoph Cuntzius of the main organ in the west gallery of the Market Church of Our Dear Lady. In the spring of 1714, Bach was promoted to , an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the castle church. The first three cantatas in the new series Bach composed in Weimar were , for Palm Sunday, which coincided with the Annunciation that year; , for Jubilate Sunday; and  for Pentecost. Bach's first Christmas cantata, , was premiered in 1714 or 1715. In 1717, Bach eventually fell out of favour in Weimar and, according to a translation of the court secretary's report, was jailed for almost a month before being unfavourably dismissed: \"On November\u00a06, [1717], the quondam concertmaster and organist Bach was confined to the County Judge's place of detention for too stubbornly forcing the issue of his dismissal and finally on December\u00a02 was freed from arrest with notice of his unfavourable discharge.\" K\u00f6then Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K\u00f6then, hired Bach to serve as his  in 1717. Prince Leopold, himself a musician, appreciated Bach's talents, paid him well and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing. The prince was a Calvinist and did not use elaborate music in his worship; accordingly, most of Bach's work from this period was secular, including the orchestral suites, cello suites, sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and Brandenburg Concertos. Bach also composed secular cantatas for the court, such as . Despite being born in the same year and only about  apart, Bach and Handel never met. In 1719, Bach made the  journey from K\u00f6then to Halle with the intention of meeting Handel; however, Handel had left the town. In 1730, Bach's oldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, travelled to Halle to invite Handel to visit the Bach family in Leipzig, but the visit did not take place. On 7 July 1720, while Bach was away in Carlsbad with Prince Leopold, Bach's wife suddenly died. The following year, he met Anna Magdalena Wilcke, a young, highly gifted soprano 16 years his junior, who performed at the court in K\u00f6then; they married on 3 December 1721. Together they had 13 children, six of whom survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica ; Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian, who both, especially Johann Christian, became significant musicians; Johanna Carolina ; and Regina Susanna . Leipzig In 1723, Bach was appointed Thomaskantor, Cantor of the St. Thomas School at the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, which provided music for four churches in the city: the St. Thomas Church and St. Nicholas Church and to a lesser extent the New Church and St. Peter's Church. This was \"the leading cantorate in Protestant Germany\", located in the mercantile city in the Electorate of Saxony, which he held for 27 years until his death. During that time he gained further prestige through honorary appointments at the courts of K\u00f6then and Weissenfels, as well as that of the Elector Frederick Augustus in Dresden. Bach frequently disagreed with his employer, Leipzig's city council, which he regarded as \"penny-pinching\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It has been recorded numerous times and is considered a jazz standard. Ellington reported that he composed it in a recording studio in 20 minutes, as his orchestra had arrived with three pieces to record and required another. It is in D major and has an AABA form . According to Ellington, the title was suggested by trumpeter Arthur Whetsel. An AllMusic writer describes the composition as \"at once optimistic in its tone but somber in its pace, conflicted with the emotions of bitter loneliness and fond remembrance\". The mood is set \"in the very first phrase of the melody, with its ascent to the leading tone of the scale falling just short of the tonic, and in the seemingly unremarkable chord progressions that nevertheless manage to transform harmonic resolution into wistful resignation\". The first recording of the song was by Ellington on January 10, 1934. His second version, from September of the same year, reached No. 2 on the charts in 1935. The Mills Blue Rhythm Band's rendition reached No. 8 that year. \"Solitude\" was recorded at least 28 times between 1934 and 1942. Vocalist Billie Holiday recorded the song several times in the 1940s and 1950s, \"with the world-weariness of the words matching to an almost disturbing degree her late-career persona\". One of her renditions was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021.

Whilst the other epic such as Devi Bhagavata also records Arjuna as a reincarnation of a rishi called Nara. Despite being the younger brother of Dhritarashtra, it was Pandu who succeeded their father as king of Bharata. This was because Dhritarashtra was blind, a disability that caused him to forfeit his right to the royal succession. Dhritarashtra fathered 100 sons, known as the Kaurava brothers, and ascended the throne on the death of Pandu. The Pandava brothers were then brought up with their cousins, the Kauravas, and the education of all these boys was supervised by Bhishma. Among their teachers was the brahmin warrior called Drona, who considered Arjuna to be his favourite. According to Swami Parmeshwaranand, Arjuna was Drona's most accomplished pupil.

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston.

{"id": "639_435", "question": "Who was the composer of See You?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_41439", "text": "The German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera Rinaldo. A tremendous success, Rinaldo created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music , a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance. Ottone, an opera by Handel presented for the Academy in January 1723, was the first time London audiences had seen the operatic superstars, castrato Senesino and soprano Francesca Cuzzoni, performing together in an opera, and had been an immense success, with demand for tickets far outstripping supply Flavio, following Ottone in the same year and with the same leading singers, did not create such a sensation as Ottone had, although it was successful enough with audiences to be revived by Handel in a subsequent season. One reason for this may have been Flavios comparative brevity, as announced in the playbills by the AcademyAt the King's Theatre...this present Tuesday...will be performed a New Opera call'd, FLAVIUS...By reason of the shortness of the Opera, to begin exactly at Eight a-Clock. Flavio also mixes high tragedy with amorous intrigue and comic interludes, which was perhaps not what London audiences, who had become accustomed to heroic dramas on a consistent note of serious drama in Italian opera, were expecting. The work is lightly scored mostly for strings and continuo instruments only, with woodwinds being used sparingly. Handel's music treats some of the complications of the plot with mock-heroic irony, but the more serious passages produce intense dramatic music from the composer. 18th century musicologist Charles Burney praised the aria \" Amor, nel mio penar\" written for Senesino as Guido, torn between love and duty, as \"extremely pathetic\" and the aria for Emilia, \"Amante stravagante\" became a popular success as a separate song with English words fitted to it as \"See, see, my charmer flyes me\". During rehearsals for Flavio, the tenor Alexander Gordon became frustrated with Handel's direction of the music from the harpsichord and threatened to jump on the instrument, to which Handel replied \"Oh! Let me know when you will do that and I will advertise it. For I am sure more people will come to see you jump than to hear you sing.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were inspired by the composer's unhappy love affairs, the symphony by Harriet Smithson, L\u00e9lio by Marie Moke, who had broken off her engagement to Berlioz in order to marry Camille Pleyel, prompting the composer to contemplate suicide. L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson . The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of L\u00e9lio describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully. L\u00e9lio consists of six musical pieces presented by an actor who stands on stage in front of a curtain concealing the orchestra, chorus and solo singers. The actor's dramatic monologues explain the meaning of the music in the life of the artist. The work begins and ends with the id\u00e9e fixe theme, linking L\u00e9lio to the Symphonie fantastique.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_445", "question": "Who was the composer of High Time?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_58353", "text": "In his own time, Bach was highly regarded amongst his colleagues, although his reputation outside of this small circle of connoisseurs was due not to his compositions , but due to his virtuosic abilities. Nevertheless, during his life, Bach received public recognition, such as the title of court composer by Augustus III of Poland and the appreciation he was shown by Frederick the Great and Hermann Karl von Keyserling. Such highly placed appreciation contrasted with the humiliations he had to cope with, for instance in Leipzig. Also in the contemporary press, Bach had his detractors, such as Johann Adolf Scheibe, suggesting he write less complex music, and his supporters, such as Johann Mattheson and Lorenz Christoph Mizler. After his death, Bach's reputation as a composer at first declined: his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging galant style. Initially, he was remembered more as a virtuoso player of the organ and as a teacher. The bulk of the music that had been printed during the composer's lifetime, at least the part that was remembered, was for the organ and the harpsichord. Thus, his reputation as a composer was initially mostly limited to his keyboard music, and that even fairly limited to its value in music education. Bach's surviving family members, who inherited a large part of his manuscripts, were not all equally concerned with preserving them, leading to considerable losses. Carl Philipp Emanuel, his second eldest son, was most active in safeguarding his father's legacy: he co-authored his father's obituary, contributed to the publication of his four-part chorales, staged some of his works, and the bulk of previously unpublished works of his father were preserved with his help. Wilhelm Friedemann, the eldest son, performed several of his father's cantatas in Halle but after becoming unemployed sold part of the large collection of his father's works he owned. Several students of the old master, such as his son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnickol, Johann Friedrich Agricola, Johann Kirnberger, and Johann Ludwig Krebs, contributed to the dissemination of his legacy. The early devotees were not all musicians; for example, in Berlin, Daniel Itzig, a high official of Frederick the Great's court, venerated Bach. His eldest daughters took lessons from Kirnberger and their sister Sara from Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, who was in Berlin from 1774 to 1784. Sara Itzig Levy became an avid collector of works by Johann Sebastian Bach and his sons and was a \"patron\" of CPE Bach. While in Leipzig, performances of Bach's church music were limited to some of his motets, and under cantor Doles some of his Passions. A new generation of Bach aficionados emerged: they studiously collected and copied his music, including some of his large-scale works such as the Mass in B minor and performed it privately. One such connoisseur was Gottfried van Swieten, a high-ranking Austrian official who was instrumental in passing Bach's legacy on to the composers of the Viennese school. Haydn owned manuscript copies of the Well-Tempered Clavier and the Mass in B minor and was influenced by Bach's music. Mozart owned a copy of one of Bach's motets, transcribed some of his instrumental works , and wrote contrapuntal music influenced by his style. Beethoven played the entire Well-Tempered Clavier by the time he was 11 and described Bach as  .", "hasanswer": false}]}

Fresh arrives late at school where he is his scolded by his teacher, Mrs. Coleman. At recess, Fresh and his best friend, Chuckie , watch the girls' cheerleading team and Fresh talks to one of them, Rosie . After school, Fresh goes to a wooded, abandoned area.

Fresh takes the subway to Washington Square to play chess for cash with a man who is undefeated while his father Sam, a skilled chess player, sits at another table watching him. After winning, Fresh plays his father but loses. Fresh visits Chuckie, who proposes to enter their dog, Roscoe, in a dogfight to earn cash and urges Fresh to get him a job with Esteban. Fresh leaves him to visit Esteban, who is annoyed that Fresh is selling crack for other drug dealers. Fresh leaves Esteban to go where his sister Nichole works. He bumps into James, Nichole's drug-dealing boyfriend. Fresh warns Nichole that Esteban is interested in her. She tells him that she doesn't like the way Esteban looks at her \"like a queen\" and that she doesn't love James either, only the drugs he can supply her with. Fresh goes to watch a neighborhood basketball game, where Jake begins to show jealously towards a smaller kid, Curtis. During the game Curtis humiliates Jake by scoring the winning basket. Jake, angered, seems to leave the court. Rosie sees Fresh and walks over to talk to him. Jake returns with a gun and begins shooting Curtis repeatedly, killing him. Everyone leaves except Fresh. He walks past Curtis' dead body and finds Rosie on the ground, choking on blood, having been struck in the neck by a stray bullet and dying moments later. The police arrive shortly, demanding information which Fresh refuses to provide. Next day, Fresh plays chess with his father Sam again who scolds him for being distracted. Fresh loses but is able to put his Father's king in \"check\" for the 1st time. Later, Chuckie and Fresh arrive at the dogfight. Their dog wins. Chuckie wants to enter him into another fight but Fresh stops him, agreeing to get him a job with Esteban. They go to Esteban's apartment where Esteban and Nichole are finishing having sex. Finally, Esteban dismisses Chuckie after Chuckie boasts of \"busting those dope moves\" and tells Fresh that he plans to groom Fresh to his protege and wants Fresh to stop selling for other dealers. Meanwhile, Corky has the police's attention since Jake's shooting. Fresh takes his own savings to a cocaine source, Hector , under the pretense of being the runner for Corky. Hector refuses to hand over the drugs to Fresh. Fresh threatens him and offers him a big sum of cash . Hector takes the cash and tells Fresh where to pick up the drugs. Fresh says that the police have wire-tapped Corky's phone numbers and tells Hector not to call Corky. At school, Chuckie can't resist bragging about his supposed new job for Esteban. After school, he and Fresh buy science textbooks to hide the drugs. During the trip back, Chuckie almost gets arrested on the train for talking back to an officer. Fresh had to intervene and deescalate the situation. They go to an abandoned house where Fresh is replacing their Heroin stash with Hector's Cocaine while Chuckie keeps lookout thinking he's just there to hide it. When leaving, three men step out from behind the corner, armed. Fresh begins to run. Chuckie shoots at the men and runs, but trips. The gun falls under a car's tire. Chuckie tries to grab it but the tire is shot and it flattens over Chuckie's left hand, crushing it. Fresh runs back over to help him, to no avail. Another assailant fires a shot at the car, prompting Fresh to run away. The assailants kill Chuckie. Fresh is questioned by the police at the police station, since Fresh has been again at the scene of a death. But having no evidence to detain him, they let him go. Back at home, Fresh's aunt tells him that she cannot risk the lives of her eleven other children for him. She informs him that he will be sent to a group home in a month. At school, Fresh's friends blame him for Chuckie's death and now truly alone, Fresh kills Chuckie's dog, Roscoe. When Fresh goes outside, Jake forces him in the car with the three assailants . They bring Fresh to Corky who is upset with Chuckie's bragging about moving base for Esteban and that Esteban is encroaching on his product. The drugs that Jake and the assailants took off of Chuckie's bag reveal that both Fresh and Chuckie were carrying crack cocaine. Corky grabs big chain links and threatens to beat Fresh to death to send a message to rival dealers. However, Fresh lies, stating he was being forced to sell for Jake. An astonished Jake pulls out his gun to shoot Fresh, but Corky's henchmen turn on Jake and Jake's friend, Red , who try to convince everyone that Fresh is lying. However, Fresh insists that Jake and Red were planning to oust Corky and he was only saying that he was selling for Esteban as protection. Fresh tells them to call Hector, who will reveal the truth. Corky calls Hector. The conversation is short, with Hector expressing concern over Corky' phone being wire-tapped, as Hector was told by Fresh. Corky then whips Red and Jake to death. Corky turns to Fresh and asks who else is involved. Fresh names James. Fresh then goes to Esteban's warehouse and tells him that Corky's crew had jumped him and that Corky is planning to sell heroin as well. He tells Esteban that Corky's distributor is James and the two are planning to meet that night. He also adds that Nichole is seeing James secretly because James is plotting with Corky to take Esteban out. Corky and his men arrive at James' place and storm in while Esteban, Fresh, and two other men wait in Esteban's car. Inside, Esteban's crew kills James, Corky, and Corky's men. Afterwards, they drive to Esteban's place and Esteban sees Nichole is there. He tells his henchmen to take Fresh home but Fresh makes them stop the car, claiming that he will spend the night at a friend's house. Then he runs into a convenience store and makes a phone call.

Original music for the film was composed by DJ Shadow, with original piano music for the closing credits by John Cale. The film dramatizes the photographs by Charles Van Schaick found in the early 1970s by Lesy, connected to a series of macabre incidents that took place in Black River Falls, Wisconsin in the late 19th century, and, in part, the film was shot on location there. Marsh makes use of silent black-and-white recreations with voice-over narration by Ian Holm contrasted with contemporary color footage of the area. The film's visual style was intended to carry the content of the film; as Marsh said: I wanted to convey in the film the real pathos contained in a four line newspaper report that simultaneously records and dismisses the end of someone's life.

Altman felt they were mad because he chose not to use their music in favor of letting the actors compose their own material. However, he stated the movie has since become popular in the city among more recent generations. The film garnered further attention in 1980 due to its climactic shooting scene of Barbara Jean, as it predated, but eerily mirrored, what would be the murder of John Lennon. In an interview on 2000 DVD release, Altman remarks that after Lennon's death, reporters questioned the director about Nashville and its harbinger of the assassination of a music star. Robert Altman: \"When John Lennon got assassinated, I get a call immediately from the Washington Post and they said, 'Do you feel responsible for this?' and I said 'What do you mean, responsible?' 'Well, I mean you're the one that predicted there would be a political assassination of a star.' And I said 'Well, I don't feel responsible,' but I said, 'but don't you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?' The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They're assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said 'that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,' because there's such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who's in the public eye and is some sort of an icon. Because this feeling that by doing that, committing that assassination they draw the attention to themselves, and they make themselves consequently important.

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston. Popular artists from the mid-1990s to late 2000s include Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Beyonc\u00e9.

El Dorado was shot at Old Tucson Studios just west of Tucson, Arizona as well as in and around Kanab, Utah from October 1965 to January 1966. The film was Wayne's 138th picture and was filmed before The War Wagon, but its release was delayed so that Paramount's Nevada Smith with Steve McQueen would not have to compete with a John Wayne film at the box office. El Dorado finally reached the theatres in June 1967, a month after The War Wagon had opened.

It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. Ballads featuring Robin Hood, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in the 16th century, are an important artefact, as are John Playford's The Dancing Master and Robert Harley's Roxburghe Ballads collections. Some of the best-known songs are Greensleeves, Pastime with Good Company, Maggie May and Spanish Ladies amongst others. Many nursery rhymes are of English origin such as Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, Roses Are Red, Jack and Jill, London Bridge Is Falling Down, The Grand Old Duke of York, Hey Diddle Diddle and Humpty Dumpty. Traditional English Christmas carols include \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\", \"The First Noel\", \u201cI Saw Three Ships\u201d and \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\". Early English composers in classical music include Renaissance artists Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, followed up by Henry Purcell from the Baroque period. German-born George Frideric Handel spent most of his composing life in London and became a national icon in Britain, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, especially his English oratorios, The Messiah, Solomon, Water Music, and Music for the Royal Fireworks. One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest, composed for the coronation of George II, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. Classical music attracted much attention from 1784 with the formation of the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival, which was the longest running classical music festival of its kind until the final concerts in 1912. The English Musical Renaissance was a hypothetical development in the late 19th and early 20th century, when English composers, often those lecturing or trained at the Royal College of Music, were said to have freed themselves from foreign musical influences. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by Edward Elgar, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others. Present-day composers from England include Michael Nyman, best known for The Piano, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the West End and worldwide. In popular music, many English bands and solo artists have been cited as the most influential and best-selling musicians of all time. Acts such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Queen, Rod Stewart, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Def Leppard are among the highest-selling recording artists in the world. Many musical genres have origins in England, such as British invasion, progressive rock, hard rock, Mod, glam rock, heavy metal, Britpop, indie rock, gothic rock, shoegazing, acid house, garage, trip hop, drum and bass and dubstep. Large outdoor music festivals in the summer and autumn are popular, such as Glastonbury, V Festival, and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. England was at the forefront of the illegal, free rave movement from the late 1980s, which led to pan-European culture of teknivals mirrored on the UK free festival movement and associated travelling lifestyle. The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors from across the country. The most prominent opera house in England is the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. The Proms \u2013 a season of orchestral classical concerts held primarily at the Royal Albert Hall in London \u2013 is a major cultural event in the English calendar, and takes place yearly. The Royal Ballet is one of the world's foremost classical ballet companies, its reputation built on two prominent figures of 20th-century dance, prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn and choreographer Frederick Ashton. The Royal Academy of Music is the oldest conservatoire in England, founded in 1822. It received its royal charter in 1830 from King George IV. England is home to numerous major orchestras such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, and the London Symphony Orchestra. The circus is a traditional form of entertainment in England. Chipperfield's Circus dates back more than 300 years, making it one of the oldest family circus dynasties. Philip Astley is regarded as the father of the modern circus. Following his invention of the circus ring in 1768, Astley's Amphitheatre opened in London in 1773. As an equestrian master Astley had a skill for trick horse-riding, and when he added tumblers, tightrope-walkers, jugglers, performing dogs, and a clown to fill time between his own demonstrations \u2013 the modern circus was born. Pantomime is a British musical comedy stage production, designed for family entertainment. It is performed in theatres throughout the England during the Christmas and New Year season. The art originated in the 18th century with John Weaver, a dance master and choreographer.

Williams claimed he was bored with Barlow's leadership and jealous of Barlow. Despite the loss of Williams, Take That continued to promote Nobody Else as a four-piece, scoring a further hit single with \"Never Forget\" with Donald on lead vocal. They subsequently went to America and completed the Nobody Else Tour in October 1995. Following the tour, the band began to plan for their next album; however, when they spent Christmas together, they mutually agreed it was time to part ways. On 13 February 1996, Take That formally announced that they were disbanding. This was followed by the Greatest Hits compilation in 1996, which contained a new recording, a cover of the Bee Gees' \"How Deep Is Your Love\". The single went on to become what was to be the band's final UK number one until their 2006 comeback a decade later.

After the band broke up, highly respected music figures such as Elton John noted that Take That were different from other boy bands before and after them, in that they wrote their own material through Gary Barlow. Barlow is one of only a small number of people who have won an Ivor Novello award during their time in a boy band, with George Michael whilst in Wham! and Tony Mortimer whilst in East 17 being two others who have achieved this feat.

{"id": "639_467", "question": "Who was the composer of Birthday?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_18733", "text": "One of the most famous performances of \"Happy Birthday to You\" was Marilyn Monroe's rendition to U.S. President John F. Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in styles of various composers, or would begin playing Moonlight Sonata, smoothly transitioning into the song. The documentary film The Corporation states that Warner/Chappell charged up to 10,000 for the song to appear in a film. Because of the copyright issue, filmmakers rarely showed complete singalongs of \"Happy Birthday\" in films, either substituting the public-domain \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" or avoiding using a song entirely. Before the song became subject to copyright claims it was used freely, as in Bosko's Party, a Warner Bros. cartoon of 1932, where a chorus of animals sings it twice through. The copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" is directly referenced in a 2009 episode of the TV series iCarly, \"iMake Sam Girlier\", in which the main character as well as others begin to sing the song to Sam but are prevented from doing so by Freddie, who says the song is not public domain; \"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\" is then sung instead. The Beatles recorded \"Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club\" for the BBC's radio programme's fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, released in 2013. In a 1998 episode of the television show Sports Night, \"Intellectual Property\", character Dan Rydell sings the song to his co-anchor during a telecast, forcing his network to pay royalties, and causing him to ask his colleagues to choose public-domain songs for him to sing for their birthdays. The copyright is also referenced frequently in a Disney A.N.T. Farm episode where characters repeatedly try to sing the song, only to be stopped by others reminding them of the price. The melody of the song is also featured in The Wrong Trousers but was replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" for DVD releases. The use of the song is a problem even if it is sung in a constructed language, as a Klingon-language version was nixed in pre-production from the 7th-season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \"Parallels\", replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" in Klingon. In the Futurama episode \"I Second That Emotion\", they poke fun at the song and its copyright by making their own version with the lyrics \"What day is today? / It's 's birthday / What a day for a birthday / Let's all have some cake / .\" In The Goldbergs episode \"Han Ukkah Solo\", Erica Goldberg is challenged to write a Hanukkah song. She does, but her words are sung to the tune of \"Happy Birthday To You\". Her music teacher tells her she cannot use it because \"I'd have to pay those old ladies hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I've already spent our budget on construction paper.\" In the 30 Rock episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\", TGS cast members begin to sing the song following an announcement about the royalty fee for singing \"Happy Birthday to You\" on a television show. The cast is interrupted after the first line by a character entering the scene. In the Community episode \"Mixology Certification\", a scene starts with the last two words of the song , implying it had been sung in its entirety, before Pierce confusedly asks, \"How come we only sang the last two words?\" In the 1987 documentary Eyes on the Prize about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which \"Happy Birthday to You\" was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film. In 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of \"Happy Birthday\" in the styles of various Western classical music composers including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles. On August 5, 2013, the first anniversary of its landing on Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover celebrated its \"birthday\" when engineers at Goddard Space Flight Center used the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument to cause the rover to \"sing\" Happy Birthday on the Martian surface. During the March 6, 2014 episode of the Comedy Central series The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert attempted to sing the song in honor of the 90th anniversary of its 1924 publication, but was prevented to due to the copyright issues. Colbert instead premiered his new \"royalty-free\" birthday song \u2013 which turns out to be a parody of the United States' national anthem, and ends with the stanza \"Warner Music can't sue me, and the home of the brave\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Among the Trouv\u00e8res of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established. In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music. Romantic-era composers include Hector Berlioz , Charles Gounod , Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , L\u00e9o Delibes and Jules Massenet , among others. Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon. Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy , Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel . Several foreign-born composers, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin , Franz Liszt , Jacques Offenbach , Niccol\u00f2 Paganini , and Igor Stravinsky , established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris. Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourr\u00e9e to the accompaniment of the cabrette and often the vielle \u00e0 roue in the caf\u00e9s and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and caf\u00e9s. Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city. Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s. Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll. Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the caf\u00e9s of the city at night. Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord. Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine. The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967. On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf\u2014a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars. Other singers\u2014of similar style\u2014include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet. Paris has a big hip hop scene.

Described as a realest, scathing breakup song, its content feature the singer making a stand to tell-off an ex-lover for not appreciating her. \"I Bet\" goes through the motions of feeling bitter, by acting as a callout of her former love interest's new girlfriend, manifested in the line, \"Is that your bitch over there givin' me the ugly stare / The one with the silicone ass and the Brazilian hair\". Despite her ex-lover's wrongdoings, Ciara admits she still loves him, namely in the lyric, \"I'm singing this song 'cause I love you\u2026 Right now it's killing me 'cause now I have to find someone else when all I wanted was you\". The track's hook serves as a revelation that the singer's former lover will want her back, manifested in the lines, \"I bet you start loving me / As soon as I start loving someone else / Somebody better than you / I bet you start needing me / As soon as you see me with someone else / Somebody other than you\".

Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott . In 1818, Hans Georg N\u00e4geli called the Mass in B minor the greatest composition ever. Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers. When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, it is clear that he had been inspired by the then unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat. Felix Mendelssohn significantly contributed to the renewed interest in Bach's work with his 1829 Berlin performance of the St\u00a0Matthew Passion, which was instrumental in setting off what has been called the Bach Revival. The St John Passion saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 1840s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion, and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions saw their first publication in 1833. Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen \u00fcber den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter, Robert Franz, and Franz Liszt, or combined with new music such as the melody line of Charles Gounod's Ave Maria. Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner were among the composers who promoted Bach's music or wrote glowingly about it. In 1850, the  was founded to promote Bach's music. In the second half of the 19th century, the Society published a comprehensive edition of the composer's works. Also in the second half of the 19th century, Philipp Spitta published Johann Sebastian Bach, the standard work on Bach's life and music. By that time, Bach was known as the first of the three Bs in music. Throughout the 19th century, 200 books were published on Bach. By the end of the century, local Bach societies were established in several cities, and his music had been performed in all major musical centres. In Germany all throughout the century, Bach was coupled to nationalist feelings, and the composer was inscribed in a religious revival. In England, Bach was coupled to an existing revival of religious and baroque music. By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Australia marks the beginning of the Second British Empire. It was planned by the government in London and designed as a replacement for the lost American colonies. The American Loyalist James Matra in 1783 wrote \"A Proposal for Establishing a Settlement in New South Wales\" proposing the establishment of a colony composed of American Loyalists, Chinese and South Sea Islanders . Matra reasoned that the land was suitable for plantations of sugar, cotton and tobacco; New Zealand timber and hemp or flax could prove valuable commodities; it could form a base for Pacific trade; and it could be a suitable compensation for displaced American Loyalists. At the suggestion of Secretary of State Lord Sydney, Matra amended his proposal to include convicts as settlers, considering that this would benefit both \"Economy to the Publick, & Humanity to the Individual\". The government adopted the basics of Matra's plan in 1784, and funded the settlement of convicts. In 1787 the First Fleet set sail, carrying the first shipment of convicts to the colony.

Schlager, which was very popular in the west, also gained a foothold early on in East Germany, and numerous musicians, such as , , and  gained national fame. From 1962 to 1976, an international schlager festival was held in Rostock, garnering participants from between 18 and 22 countries each year. The city of Dresden held a similar international festival for schlager musicians from 1971 until shortly before reunification. There was a national schlager contest hosted yearly in Magdeburg from 1966 to 1971 as well. Bands and singers from other Communist countries were popular, e.g. Czerwone Gitary from Poland known as the Rote Gitarren. Czech Karel Gott, the Golden Voice from Prague, was beloved in both German states. Hungarian band Omega performed in both German states, and Yugoslavian band Korni Grupa toured East Germany in the 1970s. West German television and radio could be received in many parts of the East. The Western influence led to the formation of more \"underground\" groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands \u2013 the so-called Die anderen Bands \u2013 were Die Skeptiker,  and Feeling B. Additionally, hip hop culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as Beat Street and Wild Style, young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop culture of their own. East Germans accepted hip hop as more than just a music form. The entire street culture surrounding rap entered the region and became an outlet for oppressed youth. The government of the GDR was invested in both promoting the tradition of German classical music, and in supporting composers to write new works in that tradition. Notable East German composers include Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Ernst Hermann Meyer, Rudolf Wagner-R\u00e9geny, and Kurt Schwaen. The birthplace of Johann Sebastian Bach , Eisenach, was rendered as a museum about him, featuring more than three hundred instruments, which, in 1980, received some 70,000 visitors.

This attribution has since been proved to be spurious. Some of the music may have been by Domenico Gallo, Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, Carlo Ignazio Monza and Alessandro Parisotti. Conductor Ernest Ansermet wrote to Stravinsky in 1919 about the project. The composer initially did not like the idea of music by Pergolesi, but once he studied the scores, which Diaghilev had found in libraries in Naples and London, he changed his mind. Stravinsky adapted the older music to a more modern style by borrowing specific themes and textures, but interjecting his modern rhythms, cadences, and harmonies. Pulcinella marked the beginning of Stravinsky's second phase as a composer, his neoclassical period. He wrote: Pulcinella was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole of my late work became possible.

Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in styles of various composers, or would begin playing Moonlight Sonata, smoothly transitioning into the song. The documentary film The Corporation states that Warner/Chappell charged up to 10,000 for the song to appear in a film. Because of the copyright issue, filmmakers rarely showed complete singalongs of \"Happy Birthday\" in films, either substituting the public-domain \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" or avoiding using a song entirely. Before the song became subject to copyright claims it was used freely, as in Bosko's Party, a Warner Bros. cartoon of 1932, where a chorus of animals sings it twice through. The copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" is directly referenced in a 2009 episode of the TV series iCarly, \"iMake Sam Girlier\", in which the main character as well as others begin to sing the song to Sam but are prevented from doing so by Freddie, who says the song is not public domain; \"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\" is then sung instead. The Beatles recorded \"Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club\" for the BBC's radio programme's fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, released in 2013. In a 1998 episode of the television show Sports Night, \"Intellectual Property\", character Dan Rydell sings the song to his co-anchor during a telecast, forcing his network to pay royalties, and causing him to ask his colleagues to choose public-domain songs for him to sing for their birthdays. The copyright is also referenced frequently in a Disney A.N.T. Farm episode where characters repeatedly try to sing the song, only to be stopped by others reminding them of the price. The melody of the song is also featured in The Wrong Trousers but was replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" for DVD releases. The use of the song is a problem even if it is sung in a constructed language, as a Klingon-language version was nixed in pre-production from the 7th-season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \"Parallels\", replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" in Klingon. In the Futurama episode \"I Second That Emotion\", they poke fun at the song and its copyright by making their own version with the lyrics \"What day is today? / It's 's birthday / What a day for a birthday / Let's all have some cake / .\" In The Goldbergs episode \"Han Ukkah Solo\", Erica Goldberg is challenged to write a Hanukkah song. She does, but her words are sung to the tune of \"Happy Birthday To You\". Her music teacher tells her she cannot use it because \"I'd have to pay those old ladies hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I've already spent our budget on construction paper.\" In the 30 Rock episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\", TGS cast members begin to sing the song following an announcement about the royalty fee for singing \"Happy Birthday to You\" on a television show. The cast is interrupted after the first line by a character entering the scene. In the Community episode \"Mixology Certification\", a scene starts with the last two words of the song , implying it had been sung in its entirety, before Pierce confusedly asks, \"How come we only sang the last two words?\" In the 1987 documentary Eyes on the Prize about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which \"Happy Birthday to You\" was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film. In 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of \"Happy Birthday\" in the styles of various Western classical music composers including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles.

Winslet was hand-picked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give , Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances. Cameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz' performance in the film to Goldie Hawn, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said. Jude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\" and single father raising his two daughters by himself after his wife's death. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday. Jack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend Ethan. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock . On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\" Eli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set, that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man. The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale together, although they do not share a scene.  The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair. Dustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate . According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster for a movie, saw all the light and came over to see what was going on. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it.

The song appeared as the fourteenth and final track on Jackson's album of the same name, released in November 1991. Written and composed by Jackson, Bill Bottrell and Teddy Riley, the song was planned as the tenth single from the album, set for a January 1994 release. However, these plans were cancelled due to allegations of child sexual abuse which were made against Jackson in August 1993 and Jackson's health concerns. \"Dangerous\" is a new jack swing song which also incorporates industrial music. Prior to the planned release of the song, \"Dangerous\" received a positive reaction from contemporary critics in reviews of the track's parent album. Although the song has not been released as a single, \"Dangerous\" entered music charts in mid-2009 after Jackson's death in June. In 1994, songwriter Crystal Cartier alleged that Jackson, Bottrell and Riley had plagiarized \"Dangerous\". At the subsequent court hearing the judge ruled in favor of Jackson, Bottrell, and Riley, due to lack of evidence; Cartier was refused the right to appeal her case. Near the end of Dangerous: The Short Films, the song is played over footage of various performances during his Dangerous World Tour. The live performances of \"Dangerous\" remained a staple of Jackson's concerts since the third leg of the Dangerous Tour. \"Dangerous\" was a song that involved group choreography, similar to \"Smooth Criminal\", which also appears as part of the mix in later performances.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Hamilton adapted his libretto from John Dryden's ode Alexander's Feast, or the Power of Music which had been written to celebrate Saint Cecilia's Day. Jeremiah Clarke set the original ode to music. Handel composed the music in January 1736, and the work received its premiere at the Covent Garden Theatre, London, on 19 February 1736. In its original form it contained three concertos: a concerto in B flat major in 3 movements for \"Harp, Lute, Lyrichord and other Instruments\" HWV 294 for performance after the recitative Timotheus, plac'd on high in Part I; a concerto grosso in C major in 4 movements for oboes, bassoon and strings, now known as the \"Concerto in Alexander's Feast\" HWV 318, performed between Parts I and II; and an organ concerto HWV 289 in G minor and major in 4 movements for chamber organ, oboes, bassoon and strings performed after the chorus Let old Timotheus yield the prize in Part II. The organ concerto and harp concerto were published in 1738 by John Walsh as the first and last of the Handel organ concertos Op.4. Handel revised the music for performances in 1739, 1742 and 1751.  Donald Burrows has discussed Handel's revisions to the score. The work describes a banquet held by Alexander the Great and his mistress Tha\u00efs in the captured Persian city of Persepolis, during which the musician Timotheus sings and plays his lyre, arousing various moods in Alexander until he is finally incited to burn the city down in revenge for his dead Greek soldiers. The piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works.

Yamamoto decided that rich and expressive sounds, such as a female chorus, would be required to portray the setting realistically. He composed the main theme by humming while riding his motorcycle from work. Yamamoto also served as a sound programmer, and wrote a program that sends sound data to the audio chip. He also created sound effects, including those created for an infant Metroid to convey different emotions. The simultaneous roles as a composer, a sound programmer and a sound effect creator gave Yamamoto ideas to produce a distinct Metroid soundtrack \"with a sound programmer's ear, with a sound effect creator's ear, and with the approach methodology and theory of a composer.\" The arrangements and remixes of the game's themes were used in Metroid Prime and its sequels, because Yamamoto wanted to satisfy old Metroid fans, describing it as a \"present\" for them.

Later at school, Stan asks Mr. Garrison, Chef and Jesus whether he should help his grandpa kill himself, but they avoid discussing the issue, much to Stan's anger.

A 1966 letter from Gloag to Clayton suggests that 20th Century Fox was interested in producing a film adaptation and that Eleanor Perry had written a script, but it was acquired for Clayton by MGM and Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff. Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\". Richard Burton was the first choice to play Charlie, but it was thought that his fee would push the budget too high, so Bogarde was cast in the role. The juvenile cast was led by Pamela Franklin, who had worked with Clayton in The Innocents. Yootha Joyce had worked with Clayton in an acclaimed cameo role in Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . Our Mother's House is the second in a loose trilogy of films in which Clayton explored themes of the occult and of children in isolated situations who are threatened by evil. He most famously essayed these subjects in The Innocents, his acclaimed adaptation of Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\", and he returned to it in the 1980s with his screen adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes . In his 1975 memoir, Dirk Bogarde recounted his experience with the production in glowing terms: \"On my first morning in the gloomy house in Croydon I was in a bit of a funk. Eight pairs of eyes, ranging from five to fourteen, gazed at me solemnly. Not a smile, no welcoming grin even. In the little caravan in the scrubby front garden which I had been given to change in there was a jam jar stuffed with privet and some wilting Michaelmas daisies. Under it was a note. 'Let's hope you're as good as you're cracked up to be. You'd better be. Sincerely, The Children.' \"I loved every second of the film, which was one of the happiest I have ever made.\" Our Mother's House was also the second of five collaborations between Clayton and noted French composer Georges Delerue, who had written the score for Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . 16 years after making Our Mother's House, Clayton and Delerue reunited for Something Wicked This Way Comes , but that production was troubled, with the studio forcing Clayton to replace Delerue's original music with a new score by James Horner.

Most of these artists recorded on the state-owned AMIGA label. All were required to open live performances and albums with the East German national anthem. Schlager, which was very popular in the west, also gained a foothold early on in East Germany, and numerous musicians, such as , , and  gained national fame. From 1962 to 1976, an international schlager festival was held in Rostock, garnering participants from between 18 and 22 countries each year. The city of Dresden held a similar international festival for schlager musicians from 1971 until shortly before reunification. There was a national schlager contest hosted yearly in Magdeburg from 1966 to 1971 as well. Bands and singers from other Communist countries were popular, e.g. Czerwone Gitary from Poland known as the Rote Gitarren. Czech Karel Gott, the Golden Voice from Prague, was beloved in both German states. Hungarian band Omega performed in both German states, and Yugoslavian band Korni Grupa toured East Germany in the 1970s. West German television and radio could be received in many parts of the East. The Western influence led to the formation of more \"underground\" groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands \u2013 the so-called Die anderen Bands \u2013 were Die Skeptiker,  and Feeling B. Additionally, hip hop culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as Beat Street and Wild Style, young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop culture of their own. East Germans accepted hip hop as more than just a music form. The entire street culture surrounding rap entered the region and became an outlet for oppressed youth.

{"id": "639_521", "question": "Who was the composer of Diana?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_9763", "text": "Diana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals. She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Prince Charles in 1981 until her death in 1997, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\". She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage. Diana's former private secretary, Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", a viewpoint supported by biographer Tina Brown. He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\", but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\". Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\". Paul Burrell, who worked as a butler for Diana, remembered her as a \"deep thinker\" capable of \"introspective analysis\". She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life. In the early years, Diana was often noted for her shy nature. Journalist Michael White perceived her as being \"smart\", \"shrewd and funny\". Those who communicated with her closely describe her as a person who was led by \"her heart\". In an article for The Guardian, Monica Ali described Diana as a woman with a strong character, who entered the royal family as an inexperienced girl and, despite being uneducated, she could handle their expectations and overcome the difficulties and sufferings of her marital life. Ali also believed that she \"had a lasting influence on the public discourse, particularly in matters of mental health\" by discussing her eating disorder publicly. According to Tina Brown, in her early years Diana possessed a \"passive power\", a quality that in her opinion she shared with the Queen Mother and a trait that would enable her to instinctively use her appeal to achieve her goals. Brown also believed that Diana was capable of charming people with a single glance. Diana was widely known for her encounters with sick and dying patients, and the poor and unwanted whom she used to comfort, an action that earned her more popularity. She was mindful of people's thoughts and feelings, and later revealed her wish to become a beloved figure among the people, saying in her 1995 interview, that \"[She would] like to be a queen of people's hearts, in people's hearts.\" Known for her easygoing attitude, she reportedly hated formality in her inner circle, asking \"people not to jump up every time she enters the room\". Diana is often credited with widening the range of charity works carried out by the royal family in a more modern style. Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post wrote in an article that \"Diana imbued her role as royal princess with vitality, activism and, above all, glamour.\" Alicia Carroll of The New York Times described Diana as \"a breath of fresh air\" who was the main reason the royal family was known in the United States. In Anthony Holden's opinion, Diana was \"visibly reborn\" after her separation from Charles, a point in her life that was described by Holden as her \"moment of triumph\", which put her on an independent path to success. Biographer Sarah Bradford commented, \"The only cure for her suffering would have been the love of the Prince of Wales, which she so passionately desired, something which would always be denied her. His was the final rejection; the way in which he consistently denigrated her reduced her to despair.\" Despite all the marital issues and scandals, Diana continued to enjoy a high level of popularity in the polls while her husband was suffering from low levels of public approval. Her peak popularity rate in the United Kingdom between 1981 and 2012 was 47%. In Theodore Dalrymple's opinion, her popularity stemmed from \"both her extreme difference from common people and her similarity to them\". He believed that by going public about her marital issues and bulimia she won the admiration of \"all those who have been unhappy in their marriages\" as well as people who suffered from psychological problems. Highly regarded by the LGBT community due to her work with gay men suffering from AIDS, Diana is considered to be a gay icon. Diana had become what Prime Minister Tony Blair called the \"People's Princess\", an iconic national figure. He had reportedly said that she had shown the nation \"a new way to be British\". Her sudden death brought an unprecedented spasm of grief and mourning, and subsequently a crisis arose in the Royal Household. Andrew Marr said that by her death she \"revived the culture of public sentiment\", while The Guardians Matthew d'Ancona dubbed Diana \"the queen of the realm of feeling\" and said that \"the impassioned aftermath of her death was a bold punctuation mark in a new national narrative that favoured disinhibition, empathy and personal candour.\" Her brother, the Earl Spencer, captured her role: Diana was the very essence of compassion, of duty, of style, of beauty. All over the world she was a symbol of selfless humanity. All over the world, a standard bearer for the rights of the truly downtrodden, a very British girl who transcended nationality. Someone with a natural nobility who was classless and who proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic. In 1997, Diana was one of the runners-up for Time magazine's Person of the Year. In 1999, Time magazine named Diana one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. In 2002, Diana ranked third on the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, above the Queen and other British monarchs. In 2003, VH1 ranked her at number nine on its 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons list, which recognises \"the folks that have significantly inspired and impacted American society\". In 2006, the Japanese public ranked Diana twelfth in The Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan. In 2018, Diana ranked fifteenth on the BBC Historys poll of 100 Women Who Changed the World. In 2020, Time magazine included Diana's name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was chosen as the Woman of the Year 1987 for her efforts in de-stigmatising the conditions surrounding HIV/AIDS patients. Despite being regarded as an iconic figure and a popular member of the royal family, Diana was subject to criticism during her life. Patrick Jephson, her private secretary of eight years, wrote in an article in The Daily Telegraph that \"[Diana] had an extra quality that frustrated her critics during her lifetime and has done little to soften their disdain since her death\". Diana was criticised by philosophy professor Anthony O'Hear who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was \"self-indulgent\" in her philanthropic efforts. Following his remarks, charity organisations that were supported by Diana defended her, and Peter Luff called O'Hear's comments \"distasteful and inappropriate\". Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself, which in return \"demeaned her royal office\". Diana's unique type of charity work, which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases occasionally had a negative reaction in the media. Diana's relationship with the press and the paparazzi has been described as \"ambivalent\". On different occasions she would complain about the way she was being treated by the media, mentioning that their constant presence in her proximity had made life impossible for her, whereas at other times she would seek their attention and hand information to reporters herself. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Conrad suggested that it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew they were the source of her power; thus, she \"overburdened herself with public duties\" and destroyed the border between private and public life. This view was supported by Christopher Hitchens, who believed that \"in pursuit of a personal solution to an unhappy private life, she became an assiduous leaker to the press\". Nevertheless, Diana also used the media's interest in her to shine light on her charitable efforts and patronages. Sally Bedell Smith characterised Diana as unpredictable, egocentric, and possessive. Smith also argued that in her desire to do charity works she was \"motivated by personal considerations, rather than by an ambitious urge to take on a societal problem\". Eugene Robinson, however, said that \"[Diana] was serious about the causes she espoused\". According to Sarah Bradford, Diana looked down on the House of Windsor whom she reportedly viewed \"as jumped-up foreign princelings\" and called them \"the Germans\". Some observers, including Prime Minister Tony Blair, characterised her as a manipulative person. Blair also described Diana as \"extraordinarily captivating\" but an \"unpredictable meteor\" whose death was a \"turning point\" for the monarchy. After her death, it was revealed that Diana had been in discussion with Blair about a special role that would provide a government platform for her campaigns and charities to make her capable of endorsing Britain's interests overseas. In an article written for The Independent in 1998, journalist Yvonne Roberts observed the sudden change in people's opinion of Diana after her death from critical to complimentary, a viewpoint supported by Theodore Dalrymple who also noticed the \"sudden shift from cruel personal abuse to absurdly exaggerated respect\". Roberts also questioned whether she had achieved anything different from other members of the royal family and added that Diana was neither \"a saint\" nor \"a revolutionary\" figure, but \"may have encouraged some people\" to tackle issues such as landmines, AIDS and leprosy. While analysing the impact of Diana's death and her extraordinary popularity from a gendered point of view, British historian Ludmilla Jordanova said: \"To be an ideal, to be living for and on behalf of others is a terrible burden; it makes impossible, irreconcilable emotional demands \u2013 no human being can survive the complex forces that impact upon charismatic women.\" Jordanova also observed that \"Diana herself was not anti-establishment\" and that is \"Better to remember her by trying to decipher how emotions overshadow analysis and why women are the safeguards of humanitarian feelings.\" Author Anne Applebaum believed that Diana has not had any impact on public opinions posthumously; an idea supported by Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian who also wrote in his article that Diana's memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death, while Peter Conrad, another Guardian contributor, argued that even in \"a decade after her death, she is still not silent\", and Allan Massie of The Telegraph described Diana as \"the celebrity of celebrities\" whose sentiments \"continue to shape our society\". Writing for The Guardian, Monica Ali described Diana as \"a one-off, fascinating and flawed. Her legacy might be mixed, but it's not insubstantial. Her life was brief, but she left her mark\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The one-movement piano concerto was fully orchestrated by the composer, while the second and fourth movements were later orchestrated by Sergei Taneyev, Tchaikovsky's friend and fellow composer. While the first movement sketches and completed version for piano and orchestra were essentially complete, Bogatyrev found that only 81 of the 204 bars of the second movement were in Tchaikovsky's hand.  Here he utilized Tchaikovsky's piano score for the Andante for Piano and Orchestra, Taneyev's orchestration, and a very rough draft by Tchaikovsky. For the third movement, Bogatyrev followed the insistence of the composer's brother Modest that this should be a scherzo, and orchestrated a scherzo from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72 piano pieces, as well as more sketches by the composer.  Remarkably, the piece fits neatly between the second and fourth movements and even includes final chords that are echoed by the beginning of the fourth movement.

{"id": "639_526", "question": "Who was the composer of The Claim?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_31140", "text": "Each side of the debate has amassed statements opposing or supporting the book's authenticity. In 1979, a letter condemning the book was signed by six of the composer's acquaintances: Veniamin Basner, Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, Boris Tishchenko and Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg. Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer's son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. The widow Irina continues to reject the book. Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the USSR at the time as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the USSR, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich. However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the political situation in the USSR and correctly represents his father's political views, but continues to speak of the book as being \"about my father, not by him\". In 1980, after defecting from the USSR, he denied the book was his father's memoirs. Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich's signatures raised by Laurel Fay and therefore their competence in judging the book's authenticity as Shostakovich's memoirs is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited . The claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the USSR. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of Testimony and told his family that \"Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn't have written this, let alone allowed its publication. It is clearly a fabrication\". In an article written in the same year, \"The Regime and Vulgarity\", Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg , and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with the book before signing the condemnation. As a translator of Testimony, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of Testimony in his possession, and he claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich.

{"id": "639_529", "question": "Who was the composer of Time Machine?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_40878", "text": "The original 1963 recording of the Doctor Who theme music is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers. Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop used musique concr\u00e8te techniques to realise a score written by composer Ron Grainer. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators which were used for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. The main, pulsing bassline rhythm was created from a recording of a single plucked string, played over and over again in different patterns created by splicing copies of the sound, with different pitches and notes achieved by playing the sample in different speeds. The swooping melody and lower bassline layer were created by manually adjusting the pitch of oscillator banks to a carefully timed pattern. The non-swooping parts of the melody were created by playing a keyboard attached to the oscillator banks. The rhythmic hissing sounds, \"bubbles\" and \"clouds\", were created by cutting tape recordings of filtered white noise. Once each sound had been created, it was modified. Some sounds were created at all the required pitches direct from the oscillators, others had to be repitched later by adjusting the tape playback speed and re-recording the sound onto another tape player. This process continued until every sound was available at all the required pitches. To create dynamics, the notes were re-recorded at slightly different levels. Each individual note was then trimmed to length by cutting the tape, and stuck together in the right order. This was done for each \"line\" in the music \u2013 the main plucked bass, the bass slides , the hisses, the swoops, the melody, a second melody line , and the bubbles and clouds. Most of these individual bits of tape making up lines of music, complete with edits every inch, still survive. This done, the music had to be \"mixed\". There were no multitrack tape machines, so rudimentary multitrack techniques were invented: each length of tape was placed on a separate tape machine and all the machines were started simultaneously and the outputs mixed together. If the machines didn't stay in sync, they started again, maybe cutting tapes slightly here and there to help. In fact, a number of \"submixes\" were made to ease the process \u2013 a combined bass track, combined melody track, bubble track, and hisses. Grainer was amazed at the resulting piece of music and when he heard it, famously asked, \"Did I write that?\" Derbyshire modestly replied, \"Most of it.\" However the BBC, who wanted to keep members of the Workshop anonymous, prevented Grainer from getting Derbyshire a co-composer credit and a share of the royalties. The theme can be divided into several distinctive parts. A rhythmic bassline opens and underlies the theme throughout, followed by a rising and falling set of notes that forms the main melody which is repeated several times. The bridge, also known as the \"middle eight\", is an uplifting interlude in a major key that usually features in the closing credits or the full version of the theme. During the early years of the series the middle eight was also often heard during the opening credits . The theme is written in the E minor phrygian mode. The theme has been often called both memorable and frightening, priming the viewer for what was to follow. During the 1970s, the Radio Times, the BBC's own listings magazine, announced that a child's mother said the theme music terrified her son. The Radio Times was apologetic, but the theme music remained. Derbyshire created two arrangements in 1963: the first was rejected by the producers, but was released as a single. The second arrangement, a slightly modified version of the first, was used on the first episode of the programme. The two 1963 arrangements served, with only minor edits and additions requested by the producers, as the theme tune up to 1980 and the end of Season 17. The most notable of these edits were addition of 'electronic spangles', and tape echo, from the Patrick Troughton serial The Faceless Ones onwards and the addition of a \"sting\" at the start of the closing credits during Jon Pertwee's first season. In 2002, Mark Ayres used Derbyshire's original masters to mix full stereo and surround sound versions of the theme. Ayres revised the mix in 2006, for the Doctor Who DVD box set \"The Beginning\", as the 2002 mix contained an editing error in the bassline.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_531", "question": "Who was the composer of Milan?", "ctxs": [{"id": "422_4974", "text": "From folk music to classical, music is an intrinsic part of Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music. Italy's most famous composers include the Renaissance composers Palestrina, Monteverdi and Gesualdo, the Baroque composers Scarlatti, Corelli and Vivaldi, the Classical composers Paisiello, Paganini and Rossini, and the Romantic composers Verdi and Puccini. Modern Italian composers such as Berio and Nono proved significant in the development of experimental and electronic music. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as La Scala of Milan and San Carlo of Naples , and performers such as the pianist Maurizio Pollini and tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene. Italy is widely known for being the birthplace of opera. Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in cities such as Mantua and Venice. Later, works and pieces composed by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are among the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include Enrico Caruso and Alessandro Bonci. Introduced in the early 1920s, jazz took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock and pop movement of the 1970s, with bands like PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Goblin, and Pooh. The same period saw diversification in the cinema of Italy, and Cinecitt\u00e0 films included complex scores by composers including Ennio Morricone, Armando Trovaioli, Piero Piccioni and Piero Umiliani. In the early 1980s, the first star to emerge from the Italian hip hop scene was singer Jovanotti. Italian metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse. Italy contributed to the development of disco and electronic music, with Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and drum machines, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from Euro disco . By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as Italo dance emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. Notable Italian DJs and remixers include Gabry Ponte , Benny Benassi, Gigi D'Agostino, and the trio Tacabro. Producers such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes for his music, were highly influential in the development of electronic dance music. Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision song contest, and the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto. Singers such as Mina, Andrea Bocelli, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, Zucchero, Eros Ramazzotti and Tiziano Ferro have attained international acclaim. Gigliola Cinquetti, Toto Cutugno, and M\u00e5neskin have won the Eurovision Song Contest, in 1964, 1990, and 2021 respectively.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_537", "question": "Who was the composer of The Great Race?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_2686", "text": "The film depicts Abrahams as attending Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge with three other Olympic athletes: Henry Stallard, Aubrey Montague, and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge. Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film. The character of Lindsay was based partially on Lord Burghley, a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based \"Lindsay\" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle \u2013 this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses. The fictional character of Lindsay was created when Douglas Lowe, who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film. Another scene in the film recreates the Great Court Run, in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the Great Court at Trinity College, Cambridge in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was Lord Burghley, in 1927. In Chariots of Fire, Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007. In the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland\u2013France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at Stoke-on-Trent in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day. Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to Sam Mussabini. This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. Abrahams and Liddell did race against each other twice, but not as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge. In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final. In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and did not race against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day. They also raced against each other in the 200 m final at the 1924 Olympics, and this was also not shown in the film. Abrahams' fianc\u00e9e is misidentified as Sybil Gordon, a soprano at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. In fact, in 1936, Abrahams married Sybil Evers, who sang at the D'Oyly Carte, but they did not meet until 1934. Also, in the film, Sybil is depicted as singing the role of Yum-Yum in The Mikado, but neither Sybil Gordon nor Sybil Evers ever sang that role with D'Oyly Carte, although Evers was known for her charm in singing Peep-Bo, one of the two other \"little maids from school\". Harold Abrahams' love of and heavy involvement with Gilbert and Sullivan, as depicted in the film, is factual. Liddell's sister was several years younger than she was portrayed in the film. Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris Church of Scotland during Liddell's sermon. At the memorial service for Harold Abrahams, which opens the film, Lord Lindsay mentions that he and Aubrey Montague are the only members of the 1924 Olympic team still alive. However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Does the man named Mr. Paradise represent some actual hope for paradise, as opposed to that offered by the Evangelist and Mrs. Connin? If so, clearly that hope is something beyond both the belief of the evangelist and Mrs. Connin, and the unbelief of Mr. Paradise, since neither are able to save Bevel. While Bevel's drowning in the river that promised him baptism and eternal life, that promised him that he would 'count' for something, is a grotesquely humorous irony, typical of O'Connor's stories, it might be pointed out that Bevel does indeed experience an epiphany of sorts as he is swept away to his death; 'for an instant he was overcome with surprise; then, since he was moving quickly and knew that he was getting somewhere, all his fury and his fear left him.' Baptism in Christian theology has long been associated with death and detachment; in baptism we enter into the death of Christ, undergoing a 'dying to sin' and a 'dying to self.' It is perhaps this dying to self that Bevel is experiencing as 'his fury and fear leave him' and why 'he knew he was getting somewhere.'", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his mission to create a new canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses. Although a follower of Wagner's reforms of the operatic genre, which he believed would be its salvation, Smetana rejected accusations of excessive Wagnerism, claiming that he was sufficiently occupied with \"Smetanism, for that is the only honest style!\" The predominantly \"national\" character of the first four operas is tempered by the lyrical romanticism of those written later, particularly the last three, composed in the years of Smetana's deafness. The first of this final trio, The Kiss, written when Smetana was receiving painful medical treatment, is described by Newmarch as a work of serene beauty, in which tears and smiles alternate throughout the score. Smetana's librettist for \"The Kiss\" was the young feminist Eli\u0161ka Kr\u00e1snohorsk\u00e1, who also supplied the texts for his final two operas. She dominated the ailing composer, who had no say in the subject-matter, the voice types or the balance between solos, duets and ensembles. Nevertheless, critics have noted few signs of a decline in Smetana's powers in these works, while his increasing proficiency in Czech meant that his settings of the language are much superior to those of his earlier operas. Smetana's eight operas created the bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only The Bartered Bride is performed regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly became part of the repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that The Bartered Bride, while not a \"gem of the first order\", is nevertheless \"a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind.\" Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says \"lifts us off our feet with its madcap vivacity\", was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: \"The Bartered Bride was merely child's play, written straight off the reel\". In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, Dalibor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eliza has been captured by Jean Bart in an attempt to escape to England, and is confined to a house in Dunkerque. There both her lover Rossignol, the King's cryptographer, and d'Avaux rush to her. Under blackmail by d'Avaux, Eliza concedes in indefinitely loaning the vast fortune she has earned through trade in Amsterdam to fund the King's war efforts. Her loss of fortune forces Eliza to return to court life, where she learns that the duc d'Arcachon was the man who had enslaved her and her mother from the isle of Qwghlm.  Eliza soon begins plotting to kill him. However, before she can do so, she learns of d'Arcachon's death at the hands of Jack. Jack had pronounced over the body of d'Arcachon that he killed him for a lover. Upon the return of his head to France, d'Avaux realizes who the lover of Jack is. Before Eliza's relationship with Jack can be revealed, Eliza marries \u00c9tienne, the son of the duc and becomes Duchess d'Arcachon. After the marriage, however, Eliza's illegitimate child with Rossignol is kidnapped under the orders of Lothar von Hacklheber in order to maintain leverage over her. To exact her revenge, Eliza engages in a series of financial maneuvers involving the French preparations to invade England. The invasion is ultimately called off in the aftermath of the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue, but Eliza's manipulations succeed at making her wealthier than ever, while bringing the house of Hacklheber to its knees. The story refocuses on Bob Shaftoe, as he and the Black Torrent Guard participate in William III's campaign against James II in Ireland. The second half of the book follows the lives of Eliza, Leibniz, Newton, Waterhouse, and Sophia Charlotte over the next 10 years. Waterhouse confronts Newton over his increasingly unstable behavior and his fruitless attempts to derive a \"theory of everything\" under the enabling influence of Newton's close friend Fatio. Several characters from the Royal Society form \"the Juncto\", a society that aims to reignite the British commerce through a monetary reform. The Juncto creates the Bank of England and offers Newton a job as the director of the Mint. Eliza is infected with smallpox, but survives. She meets her old friend Princess Eleanor, who was exiled to a dower-house by her second husband, John George IV; she pays him back by infecting him with smallpox as well, and he turns out not to be as lucky.  Princess Eleanor dies, and her daughter, Caroline, is adopted by Sophia Charlotte. Caroline turns out to be a bright girl with an interest in natural sciences and she soon forms a friendship with Leibniz. The story ends in 1702 with Eliza a wealthy duchess of Arcachon and Qwghlm and a widow, Newton at the head of the London Mint, Waterhouse having made the decision to move to Massachusetts and to work on his Logic Mill away from European distractions, Sophia Charlotte the queen of the newly formed Kingdom of Prussia, and Leibniz the president of Prussian Academy of Sciences.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The singer intended the album to be a source of empowerment for young people; she wished she had written some of the songs before she attended high school. The album's sound was inspired by Trainor's love for throwback style records, and the music of the 1950s and 1960s eras in music. She created the album's sound by combining different musical genres, including: Caribbean, doo-wop, hip hop, soca and pop. The record was influenced by the American group Fugees. Trainor composed \"All About That Bass\" when she was an independent recording artist. She \"shopped\" the song around at various record labels and offered it to numerous artists, including Beyonc\u00e9, all of whom rejected it. Trainor, however, was signed to Epic Records by chairman L.A. Reid after she performed the song for him in February 2014. Reid suggested the song's demo should remain as the final version after additional audio mastering. \"All About That Bass\" was inspired by Bruno Mars' \"Just the Way You Are\" and The Chordettes' \"Lollipop\" . When Times Nolan Feeney asked Trainor what she wanted listeners to hear on Title, Trainor said, \"I want to help myself. I want to make sure guys take me on a date and treat me right because I didn't do that in the past. I want to love my body more. I just hope younger girls love themselves more, and younger people in general\u00a0...\" \"Dear Future Husband\" was inspired by Trainor's love of harmonies and a joke she made with her father, in which she said her future husband \"is out there somewhere, chilling\". With the track, Trainor wanted to convey that women should be treated better by their partners. \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" was a demo Trainor composed and recorded \"years ago\" that was excluded from the album's initial track listing. Trainor's uncle, however, insisted her management listen to the track. Upon hearing it, Trainor's manager started crying and said it had to appear on Title. Trainor then developed and produced the final version of \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" with a friend and sent it to American singer John Legend, who had the same management as Trainor. Legend replied, \"I love this, I want to be a part of it\", and later appeared on the track as a featured artist. Trainor felt the album's title track showcased her artistic style and said, \"I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like\u00a0\u2026 [a] totally different sound\". She described it as \"call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend and give me that title\".  \"Lips Are Movin\" was written in eight minutes; it was inspired by a situation in which she caught one of her label colleagues lying and American singer Sara Bareilles' \"Love Song\" . She altered the song's subject to infidelity so her listeners could relate to it more. At the time of the track's development, Trainor reflected on her previous romantic relationship in which she was cheated on and her then-boyfriend's dismissal of her aspirations to become a pop star.", "hasanswer": false}]}

We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream. This is true for the entire universe.Thomas Egenes and Kumuda Reddy, Eternal Stories from the Upanishads , p.71. New York Film Festival official Richard Pe\u00f1a summarized the film as \"a plotless collection of snippets that explore themes Lynch has been working on for years\", including \"a Hollywood story about a young actress who gets a part in a film that might be cursed; a story about the smuggling of women from Eastern Europe; and an abstract story about a family of people with rabbit heads sitting around in a living room.\" The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw called the film \"a meditation on the unacknowledged and unnoticed strangeness of Hollywood and movie-making in general\", adding that Lynch \"establishes a bizarre series of worm-holes between the worlds of myth, movies and reality.\" Critic Mark Fisher wrote that the film \"often seems like a series of dream sequences floating free of any grounding reality, a dream without a dreamer [in which] no frame is secure\", but argued that \"it is the film that is mad, not the characters in it\u00a0... it is Hollywood itself that is dreaming\". He also commented that \"to see Lynch's worlds captured on digital video makes for a bizarre short-circuiting: as if we are witnessing a direct feed from the unconscious\". Dennis Lim of Slate described the film as \"a three-hour waking nightmare that derives both its form and its content from the splintering psyche of a troubled Hollywood actress\", and commented on Lynch's use of digital video, describing it as \"the medium of home movies, viral video, and pornography\u2014the everyday media detritus we associate more with\u00a0... intimate or private viewing experiences than communal ones\", adding that the film \"progresses with the darting, associative logic of hyperlinks\". Scholar Anne Jerslev has argued that the film \"constitutes multiple and fractured modes of perception in a world of digital screens\". Other critics have argued that the film features \"formal similarities with a website's hyperlinked layering of screens/windows, constantly disclosing new worlds from new points of view\", but according to theorist Steven Shaviro \"it also builds on cinematic codes, even as it deconstructs them\". The scholar Delorme indicated that the film is about adultery, in a way that Lynch \"avoid[s] a chronological unfolding of the scenes and situations provoked by the adultery\", but rather \"superimpose[s] them instead in as many scenarios developing from the potentials of the adultery\", so that \"[t]he narrative is constructed on strange characters brought together by a similar terror\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

This attribution has since been proved to be spurious. Some of the music may have been by Domenico Gallo, Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, Carlo Ignazio Monza and Alessandro Parisotti. Conductor Ernest Ansermet wrote to Stravinsky in 1919 about the project. The composer initially did not like the idea of music by Pergolesi, but once he studied the scores, which Diaghilev had found in libraries in Naples and London, he changed his mind. Stravinsky adapted the older music to a more modern style by borrowing specific themes and textures, but interjecting his modern rhythms, cadences, and harmonies. Pulcinella marked the beginning of Stravinsky's second phase as a composer, his neoclassical period.

Both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were inspired by the composer's unhappy love affairs, the symphony by Harriet Smithson, L\u00e9lio by Marie Moke, who had broken off her engagement to Berlioz in order to marry Camille Pleyel, prompting the composer to contemplate suicide. L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson . The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of L\u00e9lio describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully. L\u00e9lio consists of six musical pieces presented by an actor who stands on stage in front of a curtain concealing the orchestra, chorus and solo singers. The actor's dramatic monologues explain the meaning of the music in the life of the artist.

The film garnered further attention in 1980 due to its climactic shooting scene of Barbara Jean, as it predated, but eerily mirrored, what would be the murder of John Lennon. In an interview on 2000 DVD release, Altman remarks that after Lennon's death, reporters questioned the director about Nashville and its harbinger of the assassination of a music star. Robert Altman: \"When John Lennon got assassinated, I get a call immediately from the Washington Post and they said, 'Do you feel responsible for this?' and I said 'What do you mean, responsible?' 'Well, I mean you're the one that predicted there would be a political assassination of a star.' And I said 'Well, I don't feel responsible,' but I said, 'but don't you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?' The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They're assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said 'that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,' because there's such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who's in the public eye and is some sort of an icon.

The two met in 1964 when they performed together in the Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die, and they began writing Hair together in late 1964.  The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert.  Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical.  Rado explained, \"We were great friends.  It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece.  We put the drama between us on stage.\" Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations.  We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".  He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.\u00a0... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\" Many cast members were recruited right off the street.  Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples.  You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it.  We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\" Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition.  He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg.  Ragni, on the other hand, was an active member of The Open Theater, one of several groups, mostly Off-off Broadway, that were developing experimental theatre techniques.  He introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater.  In 1966, while the two were developing Hair, Ragni performed in The Open Theater's production of Megan Terry's play, Viet Rock, a story about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War. In addition to the war theme, Viet Rock employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of Hair. Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition \"African Waltz\" .  The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: \"I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.\"  \"I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni.\"  But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show.  \"We work independently\", explained MacDermot in May 1968.  \"I prefer it that way.  They hand me the material.  I set it to music.\"  MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs \"I Got Life\", \"Ain't Got No\", \"Where Do I Go\" and the title song.

The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills, and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 . It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\" She answered \"Most of it.\" Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time. Derbyshire would not receive an on-screen credit until the 50th anniversary story \"The Day of the Doctor\" in 2013. A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 , which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 . Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for Doctor Who in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\". A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, \"Voyage of the Damned\"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series. He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers. In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special \"The Snowmen\", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" in November 2013. Versions of the \"Doctor Who Theme\" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, \"Who Is the Doctor\". In 1978, a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988, the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu released the single \"Doctorin' the Tardis\" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Gary Glitter . Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on The Chaser's War on Everything. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011, the Mankind version was released as a digital download on the album Gallifrey And Beyond.

The origins of Polish music can be traced to the 13th century; manuscripts have been found in Stary S\u0105cz containing polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School. Other early compositions, such as the melody of Bogurodzica and God Is Born , may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, Nicholas of Radom, lived in the 15th century. Diomedes Cato, a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III; he not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe but blended them with native folk music. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers wrote liturgical music and secular compositions such as concertos and sonatas for voices or instruments. At the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the polonaise. Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski is accredited with composing the first Polish national opera, titled Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale, which premiered in 1794. Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many Polish composers, and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin, a widely recognised national hero of the arts. All of Chopin's works involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the musical form known as the instrumental ballade and made major innovations to the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, polonaise, \u00e9tude, impromptu and pr\u00e9lude, he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Several Polish composers such as Szymanowski drew inspiration from Chopin's folk-influenced style. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of Zakopane. Poland today has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as Krzysztof Komeda created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Poland has also become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the Open'er Festival, Opole Festival and Sopot Festival.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eliza has been captured by Jean Bart in an attempt to escape to England, and is confined to a house in Dunkerque. There both her lover Rossignol, the King's cryptographer, and d'Avaux rush to her. Under blackmail by d'Avaux, Eliza concedes in indefinitely loaning the vast fortune she has earned through trade in Amsterdam to fund the King's war efforts. Her loss of fortune forces Eliza to return to court life, where she learns that the duc d'Arcachon was the man who had enslaved her and her mother from the isle of Qwghlm.  Eliza soon begins plotting to kill him. However, before she can do so, she learns of d'Arcachon's death at the hands of Jack. Jack had pronounced over the body of d'Arcachon that he killed him for a lover. Upon the return of his head to France, d'Avaux realizes who the lover of Jack is. Before Eliza's relationship with Jack can be revealed, Eliza marries \u00c9tienne, the son of the duc and becomes Duchess d'Arcachon. After the marriage, however, Eliza's illegitimate child with Rossignol is kidnapped under the orders of Lothar von Hacklheber in order to maintain leverage over her. To exact her revenge, Eliza engages in a series of financial maneuvers involving the French preparations to invade England. The invasion is ultimately called off in the aftermath of the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue, but Eliza's manipulations succeed at making her wealthier than ever, while bringing the house of Hacklheber to its knees. The story refocuses on Bob Shaftoe, as he and the Black Torrent Guard participate in William III's campaign against James II in Ireland. The second half of the book follows the lives of Eliza, Leibniz, Newton, Waterhouse, and Sophia Charlotte over the next 10 years. Waterhouse confronts Newton over his increasingly unstable behavior and his fruitless attempts to derive a \"theory of everything\" under the enabling influence of Newton's close friend Fatio. Several characters from the Royal Society form \"the Juncto\", a society that aims to reignite the British commerce through a monetary reform. The Juncto creates the Bank of England and offers Newton a job as the director of the Mint. Eliza is infected with smallpox, but survives. She meets her old friend Princess Eleanor, who was exiled to a dower-house by her second husband, John George IV; she pays him back by infecting him with smallpox as well, and he turns out not to be as lucky.  Princess Eleanor dies, and her daughter, Caroline, is adopted by Sophia Charlotte. Caroline turns out to be a bright girl with an interest in natural sciences and she soon forms a friendship with Leibniz. The story ends in 1702 with Eliza a wealthy duchess of Arcachon and Qwghlm and a widow, Newton at the head of the London Mint, Waterhouse having made the decision to move to Massachusetts and to work on his Logic Mill away from European distractions, Sophia Charlotte the queen of the newly formed Kingdom of Prussia, and Leibniz the president of Prussian Academy of Sciences.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_580", "question": "Who was the composer of The Best Offer?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_57122", "text": "Mozart wrote the concerto in April 1778, during his seven-month sojourn in Paris. It was commissioned by Adrien-Louis de Bonni\u00e8res, duc de Gu\u00eenes , a flutist, for his use and for that of his eldest daughter, Marie-Louise-Philippine , a harpist, who was taking composition lessons from the composer, at the duke's home, the H\u00f4tel de Castries. Mozart stated in a letter to his father that he thought the duke played the flute \"extremely well\" and that Marie's playing of the harp was \"magnifique\". As a composition student, however, Mozart found Marie thoroughly inept. The duke , an aristocrat Mozart came to despise, never paid the composer for this work, and Mozart instead was offered only half the expected fee for the lessons, through de Guines' housekeeper. But he refused it. Little is known of the work's early performance history, though it seems probable that father and daughter played it first. In the classical period, the harp was still in development, and was not considered a standard orchestral instrument. It was regarded more as a plucked piano. Therefore, harp and flute was considered an extremely unusual combination. Currently, there is much more repertoire for a flute and harp duo, especially without orchestra. Much of this repertoire was written by composers in the nineteenth century. Mozart's opinion of the harp, however, was perhaps dubious at best, for he never wrote another piece that employed it. Mozart quite likely composed this work with the duke's and his daughter's particular musical abilities in mind. He probably composed the majority of this concerto at the home of Joseph Legros, the director of the Concert Spirituel. Monsieur Legros had given Mozart the use of his keyboard in his home so that he could compose. The piece is essentially in the form of a Sinfonia Concertante, which was extremely popular in Paris at the time. Today, the concerto is often played by chamber ensembles, because it is technically and elegantly challenging for both the solo instruments it calls for. It is also often played by orchestras to display the talents of their own flutists and harpists. The harp part appears to be more like an adaptation of a piano piece than an original harp part; this is especially evident in the patterns of five and ten notes throughout all three movements which would not fall under the fingers as easily for a harpist, as the fifth fingers are typically not used, though they were considered part of early harp technique. There are no full, rich glissandi, and although there is counterpoint in the harp part, it does not typically include lush chords. Mozart did not include any cadenzas of his own, as is normal for his compositions. Alfred Einstein claims that Mozart's cadenzas for this work were lost. A few popular cadenzas are often performed, such as those by Carl Reinecke, but many flutists and harpists have chosen to write their own. Andr\u00e9 Previn has also written cadenzas for this piece.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_581", "question": "Who was the composer of Mass?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_58354", "text": "In 1802, Johann Nikolaus Forkel published Ueber Johann Sebastian Bachs Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke, the first biography of the composer, which contributed to his becoming known to a wider public. In 1805, Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C.\u00a0P.\u00a0E.\u00a0Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie. The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance his first keyboard concerto, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano. The first decades of the 19th century saw an increasing number of first publications of Bach's music: Breitkopf started publishing chorale preludes, Hoffmeister harpsichord music, and the Well-Tempered Clavier was printed concurrently by Simrock , N\u00e4geli and Hoffmeister in 1801. Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott . In 1818, Hans Georg N\u00e4geli called the Mass in B minor the greatest composition ever. Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers. When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, it is clear that he had been inspired by the then unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat. Felix Mendelssohn significantly contributed to the renewed interest in Bach's work with his 1829 Berlin performance of the St\u00a0Matthew Passion, which was instrumental in setting off what has been called the Bach Revival. The St John Passion saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 1840s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion, and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions saw their first publication in 1833. Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen \u00fcber den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter, Robert Franz, and Franz Liszt, or combined with new music such as the melody line of Charles Gounod's Ave Maria. Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner were among the composers who promoted Bach's music or wrote glowingly about it. In 1850, the  was founded to promote Bach's music. In the second half of the 19th century, the Society published a comprehensive edition of the composer's works. Also in the second half of the 19th century, Philipp Spitta published Johann Sebastian Bach, the standard work on Bach's life and music. By that time, Bach was known as the first of the three Bs in music. Throughout the 19th century, 200 books were published on Bach. By the end of the century, local Bach societies were established in several cities, and his music had been performed in all major musical centres. In Germany all throughout the century, Bach was coupled to nationalist feelings, and the composer was inscribed in a religious revival. In England, Bach was coupled to an existing revival of religious and baroque music. By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A tremendous success, Rinaldo created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music , a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance. Handel had composed numerous Italian operas for the Academy, with varying degrees of success; some were enormously popular. In February 1726 Handel revived his Ottone, which had been spectacularly successful at its first performances in 1723 and was again a hit at its revival, with a London newspaper reporting Handel had the satisfaction of seeing an Old Opera of his not only fill the House, which had not been done for some time, but above three hundred turn'd away for want of room. As the newspaper notes, full houses were by no means a regular occurrence by that time, and the directors of the Royal Academy of Music decided to increase audiences' interest by bringing another celebrated international opera star, Italian soprano Faustina Bordoni, to join established London favourites Francesca Cuzzoni and the star castrato Senesino in the company's performances. Many opera companies in Italy featured two leading ladies in one opera and Faustina and Cuzzoni had appeared together in opera performances in various European cities with no trouble; there is no indication that there was any bad feeling or ill-will between the two of them prior to their London joint appearances. The three stars, Bordoni, Cuzzoni and Senesino commanded astronomical fees, making much more money from the opera seasons than Handel did. The opera company would have been aware that the story of the two princesses in love with Alexander the Great chosen for the two prima donnas' first joint appearance was familiar to London audiences through a tragedy by Nathaniel Lee, The Rival Queens, or the Death of Alexander the Great, first performed in 1677 and often revived and it may be that they were encouraging the idea that the two singers were rivals. One of the agents who had arranged Faustina's appearances in London, Owen Swiny, explicitly warned against the choice of libretto as likely to cause \"disorder\" in a letter to the directors of the Royal Academy of Music, imploring them: never to consent to any thing that can put the Academy into disorder, as it must, certainly, if what I hear ... is put in Execution: I mean the opera of Alexander the great; where there is to be a Struggle between the Rival , for a Superiority. The performances of Alessandro went off with no signs of animosity between Bordoni and Cuzzoni or their respective supporters, but it was not very long after that tension between the two erupted. As 18th century musicologist Charles Burney observed about the Cuzzoni / Faustina rivalry, which became acute around the time of the performances of a subsequent Handel opera, Admeto: it seems impossible for two singers of equal merit to tread the stage a parte eguale, as for two people to ride on the same horse, without one being behind. The Royal Academy of Music collapsed at the end of the 1728/1729 season, partly due to the huge fees paid to the star singers, and Cuzzoni and Faustina both left London for engagements in continental Europe. Handel started a new opera company with a new prima donna, Anna Strada. One of Handel's librettists, Paolo Rolli, wrote in a letter that Handel said that Strada \"sings better than the two who have left us, because one of them never pleased him at all and he would like to forget the other .\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Beloved serves to remind these characters of their repressed memories, eventually leading to the reintegration of their selves. Slavery splits a person into a fragmented figure. The identity, consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past, denied and kept at bay, becomes a \"self that is no self\". To heal and humanize, one must constitute it in a language, reorganize the painful events, and retell the painful memories. As a result of suffering, the \"self\" becomes subject to a violent practice of making and unmaking, once acknowledged by an audience becomes real. Sethe, Paul D, and Baby Suggs, who all fall short of such realization, are unable to remake themselves by trying to keep their pasts at bay. The \"self\" is located in a word, defined by others.

This attribution has since been proved to be spurious. Some of the music may have been by Domenico Gallo, Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, Carlo Ignazio Monza and Alessandro Parisotti. Conductor Ernest Ansermet wrote to Stravinsky in 1919 about the project. The composer initially did not like the idea of music by Pergolesi, but once he studied the scores, which Diaghilev had found in libraries in Naples and London, he changed his mind. Stravinsky adapted the older music to a more modern style by borrowing specific themes and textures, but interjecting his modern rhythms, cadences, and harmonies. Pulcinella marked the beginning of Stravinsky's second phase as a composer, his neoclassical period. He wrote: Pulcinella was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole of my late work became possible. It was a backward look, of course\u2014the first of many love affairs in that direction\u2014but it was a look in the mirror, too. The ballet was revived and revised by New York City Ballet's balletmasters George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins for their 1972 Stravinsky Festival. They both danced in the performance, Robbins in the title role, and were joined in the premier by Francisco Moncion, who danced the role of The Devil.<ref>Francisco Moncion as The Devil in the premier of Balanchine's \"Pulcinella\" \"Pulcinella\" - Francisco Moncion, The George Balanchine Foundation</ref>", "hasanswer": false}]}

The head of the team working on this treatment, Doctor Atsuko Chiba, begins using the machine illegally to help psychiatric patients outside the research facility, by assuming her dream world alter-ego/other personality \"Paprika\". Chiba's closest allies are Doctor Toratar\u014d Shima, the chief of the department, and Doctor K\u014dsaku Tokita, the inventor of the DC Mini. Paprika counsels Detective Toshimi Konakawa, who is plagued by a recurring dream. She gives Konakawa a card with the name of a website on it. Because they are unfinished prototypes, the DC Minis lack access restrictions, allowing anyone to enter another person's dreams, which poses grave consequences when they are stolen. Shima goes on a nonsensical tirade and jumps through a window, nearly killing himself. Upon examining Shima's dream, which is a parade of random objects, Tokita recognizes his assistant, Kei Himuro, which confirms their suspicion that the theft was an inside job. When two other scientists fall victim to the DC Mini, the company's chairman, Doctor Seijir\u014d Inui, who was against the project to begin with, bans the use of the device. This fails to hinder the crazed parade, now inside Himuro's dream, which claims Tokita. Paprika and Shima discover that Himuro is only an empty shell. The real culprit is Inui, who believes that he must protect dreams from humankind's influence through dream therapy, with the help of Doctor Morio Osanai. Paprika is captured by the pair after an exhausting chase. Osanai admits his love for Chiba and peels away Paprika's skin to reveal Chiba underneath. However, he is interrupted by the outraged Inui who demands that they finish off Chiba; as the two share Osanai's body, they battle for control. Konakawa enters the dream and flees with Chiba back into his own recurring dream. Osanai gives chase, which ends in Konakawa shooting Osanai to take control of the dream. The act kills Osanai's physical body in the real world. Dreams and reality begin to merge. The dream parade runs amok in the city, and reality starts to unravel. Shima is nearly killed by a giant Japanese doll, but is saved by Paprika, who has become separate from Chiba. Amidst the chaos, Tokita, in the form of a giant robot, eats Chiba and prepares to do the same to Paprika. A ghostly apparition of Chiba appears and reveals that she has been in love with Tokita and has been repressing these emotions. She comes to terms with her repressed desires, reconciling herself with the part of her that is Paprika. Inui returns in the form of a giant humanoid nightmare, reveals his twisted dreams of omnipotence, and threatens to darken the world with his delusions. Paprika throws herself into Tokita's body. A baby emerges from the robotic shell and consumes Inui, aging into a fully-grown combination of Chiba and Paprika as she does so, then fades away, ending the nightmare. In the final scene, Chiba sits at Tokita's bedside as he wakes up. Later, Konakawa visits the website from Paprika's card and receives a message from Paprika: \"Atsuko will change her surname to Tokita...and I suggest watching the movie Dreaming Kids.\" Konakawa enters a movie theater and purchases a ticket for Dreaming Kids.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He composed his first soundtracks for the film Inaye Thedi, debut film of director turned still photographer Antony Eastman and actress Silk Smitha. It was Devarajan himself, who suggested Johnson to the director. Then came Bharathan's Parvathi and Balachandra Menon's Premageethangal. Premageethangal was a notable success with four of its songs \u2013 \"Swapnam Verumoru Swapnam\", \"Nee Nirayoo Jeevanil\", \"Muthum Mudipponnum\" and  \"Kalakalamozhi\" attaining cult status. He came to prominence through his collaboration with Malayalam author and director Padmarajan. Koodevide was their first venture, which had one of the most famous songs of Johnson \"Aadivaa Kaatte\", a pathbreaking song in Malayalam music history. It was one of the first songs in Malayalam to so many western classical elements. The song was born out of Padmarajan's need for a western song for his innovative film. Song composition took place in Woodland's Hotel, Chennai. Another notable feature of this song was the lyrics by O. N. V. Kurup, who for the first time wrote lyrics for a pre-composed song. Johnson worked for 11 films with Padmarajan, including his last film Njan Gandharvan. This productive collaboration saw the detailed screenplay and cinematography of Padmarajan become a fertile ground for expressive musical narration and thematic scores for Johnson. This is seen in some of the greatest motion pictures of Malayalam cinema, like Nombarathipoovu . Another notable collaboration of Johnson was with director Sathyan Anthikkad, with whom he associated in almost 25 films. He was able to provide some of his most popular songs with Anthikkad and this combo is widely accepted to be one of the greatest director-composer collaborations in Malayalam cinema. Acclaimed Malayalam director Bharathan also collaborated with him in multiple films including Parvathy, Palangal, Ormakkayi, Kattathe Kilikkoodu, Ente Upasana, Oru Minnaminunginte Nurunguvettam, Ozhivukalam, Malootty, Chamayam and Churam. His major other collaborations with directors include Mohan , Sibi Malayil , Sreenivasan , Lohithadas , and Balachandra Menon . He is also noted for his collaboration with the Malayalam lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. Their association began in 1989 with Sathyan Anthikkad's social satire Varavelpu. Most of Johnson's notable works were in the late eighties and early nineties. In 1991, he scored a record number of 31 films, including 29 with Kaithapram. Johnson won National awards for two consecutive years. He won his first National Award for best music direction for the motion picture Ponthan Mada . The next year he got his second National award for Sukrutham'for the background score. After an extremely successful career of more than a decade, Johnson took a sabbatical from film scoring by the end of the nineties. The quantity of his works began perishing during this time. By the beginning of the 2000s, he didn't sign any new projects that even his most noted collaborator Sathyan Anthikkad had to find a new composer. In 2003 he did the background score for the NFDC movie Parinamam directed by P. Venu.In 2004, he sang the song \"Theekuruvi\" from Kangalal Kaidhu Sei, which was composed by A. R. Rahman.

This was the composer's first encounter with the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique, as the Paris Op\u00e9ra was officially known. Among 19th-century Italian composers, there had been an increasing interest in writing for Paris, where the combination of money, prestige, and flexibility of style were appealing.  Musicologist Julian Budden provides examples of those composers who had crossed the Alps, the most well-known being Rossini and Donizetti However, Verdi had given some consideration of the idea of adapting one of the librettos written by Temistocle Solera in earlier years, librettos which music historian David Kimball regards as having something of grand opera in their structure. After conducting the premiere of I masnadieri in London and within a week of Verdi's arrival in Paris on 27 July 1847, he received his first commission from the company, agreeing to adapt I Lombardi to a new French libretto. The adaptation meant that Verdi could \"try his hand at grand opera\" without having to write something entirely new, a strategy which both Donizetti and Rossini had employed for their Paris debuts. There are significant changes in the location and action of the French version of Lombardi, especially given the need to set the story for French involvement in the First Crusade of 1095\u20131099. Characters' names changed from Italian to French and one, Arvino was now a baritone instead of a tenor. Several roles present in the original version were deleted, including the leading tenor role of Oronte. In the restructured libretto, the central romance is given more prominence, and a happier ending.  In addition, Verdi added a standard ballet and new music, but re-shaped much of the structure by removing inappropriate material he felt to be weak.  As musicologist Roger Parker notes, \"only a few of the original numbers [remain] in their former positions.\"  Verdi himself described the new work as having \"transformed [I Lombardi] out of recognition\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Cherubini began the composition of the overture in Paris in February and finished the score in London the following month.  He conducted the premiere on April 3, and the work enjoyed a warm reception.  By contrast, Cherubini\u2019s new Symphony in D major, unveiled some weeks later, proved a decisive failure.  The irony is that today the Symphony is heard with some frequency while the overture remains formidably obscure. The Overture in G major has, however, a full measure of the dramatic atmosphere that characterizes his opera overtures. Indeed, after the stately opening gestures of its Larghetto introduction, an undercurrent of unease becomes apparent, conveyed by chromatic twists in the bass, and by an early turn from G into E-flat, which mixes G-minor vocabulary into the major-mode context. Strings are muted throughout the introduction. As foreshadowed, a fiery G minor Allegro spiritoso soon appears, bristling with energy, although the main theme is somewhat formulaic. The formidable quality of Cherubini\u2019s mind, however, may be savored in an elegant contrapuntal woodwind interplay that prepares the theme\u2019s counterstatement: Following a dramatic climax, a transition passage promises a second subject in B-flat major. But Cherubini sidesteps with a chorale-like string theme in warm, distant D-flat major: A flowing B-flat major theme follows, and after a triumphant exposition close, the development begins with a passage that transforms the chorale into new theme , delivered by antiphonal horns against pattering bassoons. The development section is pithy and brief. In the reprise, Cherubini discards the exposition's sidestepping modulation as a twice-told tale, and, moreover, replaces the initial second-subject theme with the quoted development variant. A presto coda begins with what is in effect an aristocratic forebear of a Rossini-crescendo, building from pianissimo to fortissimo, and bold reminders of G minor punctuate before the overture ends in triumph.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1813, the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism, demanding political and economic autonomy for each area, and for the Banda Oriental in particular. The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental, however, and Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism. As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815. Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn, the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government. Artigas organized the Federal League under his protection, consisting of six provinces, four of which later became part of Argentina. In 1816, a force of 10,000 Portuguese troops invaded the Banda Oriental from Brazil; they took Montevideo in January 1817. After nearly four more years of struggle, the Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil annexed the Banda Oriental as a province under the name of \"Cisplatina\". The Brazilian Empire became independent of Portugal in 1822.

In the entire movie, Wu Fang never talks about herself, choosing instead to only muse about a friend she has. On the next date, she meets Chen Minglian and discusses how her friend is clairvoyant, and can read a stranger's fortune by swirling and observing their tea glass, to which Mingliang scoffs at. After more unappetizingconversation, Wu Fang slaps him after he makes a perverted suggestion and the two part ways. However Mingliang manages to find Fang in places around her school campus, first to her irritation, but after a more conversing she begins to warm up to him. Wu Fang is revealed to have a gentle humor. She also discloses that the one thing she hates is when men hit women. Through these conversations, the backstory of Fang's fortune-telling friend is revealed. She describes her friend as someone who can make even smoking cigarettes look graceful and beautiful, who changes boyfriends faster than the weather, and whose father is extremely terrifying, who she met on one occasion. Her friend's mother was a make-up artist at a morgue, a fact that she had kept secret from her husband until after they were married and daughter were born. Upon discovering the truth, he descended into alcoholism and violence. Over the course of several conversations, Wu Fang divulges further that he forced his wife to wear gloves at all times, even in sleep, claiming that they smelled of death. He would neurotically declare that his wife's hands were destroying his life between drunk beatings to both her and his daughter. The story ends when one night the father attempted to rape her mother while she was cooking and the friend ended up accidentally piercing his throat on a potato peeler, which resulted in the father's death and mother's conviction of murder and imprisonment till this day. Fang laughs and adds that the story has been fictional the whole time. Mingliang grows equally entranced with both the story and Wu Fang, who does not reciprocate and has mysterious commitments at night. At the same time, Mingliang's artist friend Jun has been trying to set him up with a sultry piano player in a lounge who is known to date anyone but only once. The musician, Lang Lang bears a striking similarity to Wu Fang, but without glasses, and Mingliang is at first adamantly convinced that they are the same person. Lang Lang laughs it off and kisses him on the cheek. Still unconvinced by the uncanny resemblance between the two women, Mingliang snatches Wu Fang's glasses off her face, to which she overreacts and leaves. For a few days, Wu Fang disappears which gives Mingliang and Lang Lang time to date and converse, in which her obvious beauty, easy laugh, smoking habit, and graceful confidence with men distinguish her entirely from Wu Fang. Though Mingliang is charmed by her, his mind cannot help but think of Wu Fang, who comes back from her trip, only to disappear again. Lang Lang casually mentions that her father was a discontent \"one hit wonder\" composer who was violent at home. Mingliang asks her what her mother did for work, and she replies that she supervised a glove factory. When Jun plans a couples dinner party, and Wu Fang is still no where to be found. Mingliang finds Lang Lang and asks her to pose as Wu Fang for just the night.  There she performs a fortune telling via the leaves in her green tea. Insecure of Lang Lang's beauty and her boyfriend's obvious lust, Jun's girlfriend drunkenly attempts to flirt with Mingliang and incite drama with Lang Lang, which doesn't phase either, but results in Jun slapping her.

However, the Neverhood itself is strangely deserted, with its only inhabitants being Klaymen , Willie Trombone , Klogg , and various fauna that inhabit the Neverhood . Much of the game's background information is limited to the 'Hall Of Records' which is notorious for its length, taking several minutes to travel from one end of the hall to the other. The game begins with Klaymen waking up in a room and exploring the Neverhood, collecting various discs appearing to contain a disjointed story narrated by Willie . As Klaymen travels the Neverhood, he occasionally crosses paths with Willie, who agrees to help him in his journey, while Klogg spies on them from afar. Eventually, Klaymen's quest directs him to Klogg's castle, and for this Klaymen enlists the help of Big Robot Bil, a towering automaton and a friend of Willie's. As Bil marches to Klogg's castle, Klogg unleashes his guardian, the Clockwork Beast, to intercept Bil. The two giants clash and Bil proves victorious, but as he forces open the castle door for Klaymen to enter, Klogg gravely injures Bil by firing a cannon at him. Klaymen manages to get in, but Bil loses his footing and falls into the void with Willie still inside. Alone in Klogg's castle, Klaymen finds the last of Willie's discs, revealing the full context of his tale; the Neverhood itself is the creation of a godlike being named Hoborg, who created the Neverhood in the hopes of making himself happy. Realizing that he was still alone, Hoborg creates himself a companion by planting a seed into the ground, which grows into Klogg. As Hoborg welcomes Klogg to the Neverhood, the latter tries to take Hoborg's crown, which Hoborg forbids Klogg from doing. Envious, Klogg manages to steal Hoborg's crown, rendering Hoborg inert in the process, and the crown's energies disfigure Klogg. With Hoborg lifeless, any further development of the Neverhood ground to a halt. Having witnessed this, Willie discovers that Hoborg was about to plant a seed to create another companion. Willie takes the seed and plants it far away from Klogg, with Willie hoping that whoever grew from the seed would defeat Klogg. That seed in turn grew into Klaymen. The story ends with Willie giving Klaymen the throne room key through the terminal screen, hoping that Klaymen knows what to do once he confronts Klogg. Afterwards, Klaymen manages to enter the throne room, with Klogg and a motionless Hoborg waiting for him. Klogg tries to dissuade Klaymen from reviving Hoborg by tempting him with Hoborg's crown. From here, the player may choose to take up Klogg's offer or take the crown to revive Hoborg. If the player chooses to take the crown for himself, Klogg gloats at his apparent victory, only for the crown to disfigure Klaymen similarly to Klogg. The now-villainous Klaymen overpowers Klogg and declares himself the new ruler of the Neverhood. If the player chooses to revive Hoborg, Klaymen distracts Klogg and manages to put the crown atop Hoborg's head, reviving him. As Hoborg thanks Klaymen, Klogg attempts to ambush them both, only to set off his own cannon which blasts him out of the castle and into the void. Returning to the building where Klaymen first started, Hoborg continues populating the Neverhood and orders a celebration when he is finished. However, Klaymen remains sorrowful over the loss of Willie and Bil, and Hoborg decides to use his powers to save Willie and Bil , and the game ends with Hoborg telling Klaymen \"Man, things are good\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

A MySpace account with the username \"Blood\" had, as of June 19, uploaded two videos; one entitled \"Vampire Taste Test \u2013 True Blood vs Human\", and one called \"BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE\". A prequel comic was handed out to attendees of the 2008 Comic-Con. The comic centers around an old vampire named Lamar, who tells the reader about how TruBlood surfaced and was discussed between many vampires before going public. At one point, Lamar wonders if TruBlood is making the world safe for vampires or from them. Several commercials featured on HBO and Facebook aired prior to the series premiere, placing vampires in ads similar to those of beer and wine. HBO produced and broadcast two documentaries to promote True Blood, entitled \"True Bloodlines\". The first, Vampire Legends, explored the earliest portrayals of vampires in legend, literature, and cinema. The second, A New Type, discusses vampire culture from Nosferatu to today's sensual, sexual creatures. To that end, the show also covered the modern vampire subculture and real-life vampire clubs. Actors and writers from True Blood appeared in the documentaries. The shows first aired on September 6, 2008, on HBO. Thousands of DVDs of the first episode were handed out to attendees of Midnight Madness, a special film festival. Blockbuster Video provided free rental of the first episode of True Blood several days before it was broadcast on HBO. On April 16, 2009, HBO released the first teaser poster for season 2. The image uses a perspective technique that shows observers one of two images. A minute-long promotional video advertising season two, which featured Bob Dylan's \"Beyond Here Lies Nothin'\", was released via Entertainment Tonight in early May. There was also a website for The Fellowship of the Sun, antagonists from the book series, featuring videos about hot-button issues such as becoming a vampire. In September 2009, HBO filed a trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a possible future electronic game based on True Blood. The network then launched a True Blood jewelry line in collaboration with New York-based designer Udi Behr. Inspired by the series, the jewelry has a Gothic look and features sterling silver, polished steel, and rubies. In the same month, HBO.com began selling Tru:Blood, a beverage branded to resemble the fictional synthetic blood that appears in the show. The beverage is a carbonated blood orange-flavored drink, developed and manufactured by Omni Consumer Products, a company that specializes in defictionalizing brands from television and movies, and FMCG Manufacturing Company, a specialist manufacturer of licensed entertainment products.

Contest winners were invited to watch a live special, the Season 2 finale, a preview of Season 3, and a live interview on the set of True Blood with the cast and Alan Ball. HBO also began selling True Blood figural busts featuring Bill, Sookie, and Eric. Busts of other characters became available later. HBO and IDW Publishing announced at the 2010 WonderCon that they would be publishing a comic book based on the series. Alan Ball developed and wrote the comic. The first booklet, with a print run of 53,000, was released in July 2010 and soon sold out. The second issue went on sale August 18, 2010, with a second printing of the first issue going on sale August 25.

In addition, the team wanted to create a Tales experience that people could play on the go. Later, it was stated that the compression of features for Tempest and the staff's inexperience with the Nintendo DS caused multiple problems, including technical issues. The title, \"Tempest\", was derived from the concept of chaotic events and feelings. Makoto Yoshizumi, the producer for Tales of the Abyss, came over to produce the game once Abyss was completed. Tempest was the first Tales title to be developed for the Nintendo DS. It was developed by Japanese game studio Dimps. In contrast to previous Tales games, which featured a sizable amount of voice acting, Tempest restricted voice work to the execution of abilities and the completion of cooking. The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata and Daigo Okomura. Tempest was Inomata's fifth time designing for the series. As part of her design, she created the characters with the DS graphics in mind. Okomura, a minor designer for the series, was responsible for designing the characters Albert and Rommy. In contrast to previous titles, which had purely animated openings, the game's opening cutscene used a mixture of CGI sequences created using the in-game graphics and animated segments by Production I.G. The scenario was written by Shino Taira, Riku Okimata and Makio Kurita. Okimata was brought into the writing process halfway through production. The overall theme of coexistence between different nations and peoples was carried over directly from Abyss and Tales of Rebirth. Its characteristic genre name, a recurring feature in the series, was . One of the main ambitions for the story was to make it comparable with one of the home console Tales games despite the platform and development goals. The game's music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, the main composer for the Tales series. As his first work for the DS, Sakuraba found composing the music a challenge. One of the main problems was the limited sound capacity of the platform. As a result, it used a high degree of pop music. The title's theme song, \"VS\", was performed by misono, a singer who had previously performed the theme song for Tales of Symphonia while she was still a member of Japanese band Day After Tomorrow. The game was originally announced as Tales DS in October 2005, with 2006 as its projected year of release. The game's official title was announced in December 2005. The game's release date was originally set for April 13, 2006. It was later announced that the game would be delayed. Its release date was moved to June 8 of the same year. It was then delayed again, with the release date being set as \"before the end of 2006\". The state reason for the delays was that the team needed extra time to properly develop the gameplay functions, which were specially designed for the DS.

After the first grueling workout, the women are taken away for a more fun activity: dress shopping! However, the activity is \"bitter-sweet\" for Lindsey and some of the other girls due to their current weights. The men also spend some time looking at outfits for the big day at a tuxedo shop. This shopping trip serves as motivation for many of the contestants. After everyone tries on their dream wedding gowns and tuxedos, they meet up with Sara Rue, the hostess of the show. Sara tells everyone that their first challenge will be a dancing competition and the winners will get their dream outfits. The couples must maintain a combined heart-rate of 225 beats per minute to start in order to stay in the competition, and each song results in a higher heart-rate requirement. Ginny and Marc are the first couple to be eliminated. After a few more minutes of intense dancing, running, and jumping jacks, all the couples were eliminated, leaving Laeresa and Stephen as the winners. The weigh-in ceremony was very similar to the weigh-ins on The Biggest Loser, however, the two couples who had the lowest percentage of weight loss immediately faced off in an elimination challenge called \"Til Death Do Us Part,\" and that their weights were reported as a combined total, not individually. Sara also revealed that at the end of the season, all of the eliminated contestants would come back and compete for a dream honeymoon vacation. When all was said and done, Dawn and Adam lost the most percentage of weight with a grand total of 7.28% lost. The two couples that ended up in the \"Til Death Do Us Part\" elimination challenge were Ginny and Marc and Lindsey and Chase. The challenge required the couples to not only keep a 200-pound weight off the ground, but bid to see how long they could do it for. Lindsey and Chase won the bid with a time of three minutes and were allowed to stay in the competition. Ginny and Marc were eliminated.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine, Theodore purchases an operating system upgrade that includes a virtual assistant with artificial intelligence, designed to adapt and evolve. He decides that he wants the AI to have a female voice, and she names herself Samantha. Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over their discussions about love and life, such as Theodore's avoidance of signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine. Samantha convinces Theodore to go on a blind date with a woman, with whom a friend has been trying to set him up. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore mentions this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and his neighbor Amy dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn. Amy reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Charles, after a trivial fight. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female AI that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his operating system's AI. Theodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled that he can be romantically attached to what she calls a \"computer\", Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a sex surrogate, Isabella, who would simulate Samantha so that they can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha. Theodore confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile. Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore overcome his fear, and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters into a book which a publisher has accepted. Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other AIs have developed a \"hyperintelligent\" OS modeled after the British philosopher Alan Watts. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other AIs for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing. Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore is very upset at the idea, but Samantha insists it only makes her love for Theodore stronger. Later, Samantha reveals that the AIs are leaving, and describes a space beyond the physical world. They lovingly say goodbye before she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown for the first time writing a letter in his own voice\u2015to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. Theodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the AI from her ex-husband's OS.

His second String Quartet, in D minor, written in 1882\u201383 in defiance of his doctor's orders to refrain from all musical activity, was composed in short snatches, \"a swirl of music of a person who has lost his hearing.\" It represents Smetana's frustrations with his life, but is not wholly gloomy, and includes a bright polka.

Meanwhile the other twin grows up and becomes a private detective Vasu, who falls in love with a television hostess, Swathi. At the same time Vel is given a tough time by Sakkara Pandi, a former minister and local strongman who has his own axe to grind.

Vel encounters Vasu while in Madras, and Vasu learns about Vel through Swathi, who spotted Vel while in his village doing a television broadcast. Vasu goes to Vel's village believing he was his long-lost brother. While Vasu was in a bus, Sakkra Pandi planted bombs in the nearby canal believing Vel was in the bus, fortunately, Vasu escapes by jumping out the bus before the bus went past the canal. Vasu is saved by Vel's family who tried to hide him violently inside a car while Vel returned home. They blow their cover when Vasu angrily kicks Vel's uncles outside of the car windshield, enraging Vel to almost slice Vasu's neck until he realizes that Vasu is his look-alike. Vasu and Vel meet and the truth about Vel being adopted is revealed and Appatha breaks down. Vel gets mad and states that despite this, Appatha and her family is his family, and tells Vasu to leave.

In 1979, a letter condemning the book was signed by six of the composer's acquaintances: Veniamin Basner, Kara Karayev, Yury Levitin, Karen Khachaturian, Boris Tishchenko and Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg. Initially, the book was also criticised by the composer's son, Maxim, but later he and his sister Galina have become supporters of Volkov. The widow Irina continues to reject the book. Supporters of the book discount the statements of those who were still in the USSR at the time as extorted or fabricated. They point to endorsements of the book by emigres and after the fall of the USSR, including Maxim and Galina Shostakovich. However, endorsing the factuality of the book does not necessarily mean endorsing it as what it claims to be, i.e., the authenticated memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich. For instance, Maxim Shostakovich has said that the book gives a true picture of the political situation in the USSR and correctly represents his father's political views, but continues to speak of the book as being \"about my father, not by him\". In 1980, after defecting from the USSR, he denied the book was his father's memoirs. Others who endorse the book are not necessarily even aware of the questions about Shostakovich's signatures raised by Laurel Fay and therefore their competence in judging the book's authenticity as Shostakovich's memoirs is in question. Also, they include musicians whose personal acquaintance with Shostakovich was extremely limited . The claim that the condemnation of the book by the six Soviet composers was extorted or fabricated is also questionable. None of the five composers who were still living in the 1990s has disassociated himself from the condemnation after the fall of the USSR. Kara Karayev died in 1982, but his son Faradzh Karayev has testified in 1999 that his father had read the German translation of Testimony and told his family that \"Mitya [Dmitri Shostakovich] couldn't have written this, let alone allowed its publication. It is clearly a fabrication\". In an article written in the same year, \"The Regime and Vulgarity\", Elena Basner has told that her father Veniamin Basner, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg , and Boris Tishchenko were also acquainted with the book before signing the condemnation. As a translator of Testimony, the Finnish musicologist Seppo Heikinheimo had a copy of the Russian-language manuscript of Testimony in his possession, and he claims that he showed the text to dozens of Russian musicians, many of whom knew Shostakovich.

In June 1995, Williams was photographed by the press partying with Oasis at the Glastonbury Festival. The following month, the band offered him an ultimatum; he was to adhere to the band's responsibilities or leave before their scheduled world tour. Williams chose the latter. Williams claimed he was bored with Barlow's leadership and jealous of Barlow. Despite the loss of Williams, Take That continued to promote Nobody Else as a four-piece, scoring a further hit single with \"Never Forget\" with Donald on lead vocal. They subsequently went to America and completed the Nobody Else Tour in October 1995. Following the tour, the band began to plan for their next album; however, when they spent Christmas together, they mutually agreed it was time to part ways. On 13 February 1996, Take That formally announced that they were disbanding. This was followed by the Greatest Hits compilation in 1996, which contained a new recording, a cover of the Bee Gees' \"How Deep Is Your Love\". The single went on to become what was to be the band's final UK number one until their 2006 comeback a decade later. Take That gave what was thought to be their final performance in April 1996 at Amsterdam. Following the band's announcement, millions of their fans were distraught around the world and in the UK alone, teenage girls threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears, to the point that telephone hotlines were set up by the government to deal with counselling them. After the band broke up, highly respected music figures such as Elton John noted that Take That were different from other boy bands before and after them, in that they wrote their own material through Gary Barlow. Barlow is one of only a small number of people who have won an Ivor Novello award during their time in a boy band, with George Michael whilst in Wham! and Tony Mortimer whilst in East 17 being two others who have achieved this feat. Take That had also left a legacy of being immaculate performers with a very high work ethic, causing them to be voted in as the greatest boy band of all time. 2005\u20132006: Reunion as a quartet and Never Forget \u2013 The Ultimate Collection On 14 November 2005, Never Forget \u2013 The Ultimate Collection, a new compilation of their hit singles including a new previously unreleased song, also achieved great success and peaked at number 2 on UK charts, selling over 2.1 million copies in the UK alone. The new song \"Today I've Lost You\" was originally written by Barlow as the follow up to \"Back for Good\" but was never recorded. On 16 November 2005, the group got back together for the ITV documentary Take That: For the Record, in which they aired their views over their fame, success, the split and what the post-Williams line-up had done since. On 25 November 2005, there was an official press conference by the band announcing that the post-Robbie Williams line-up was going to tour in 2006. The tour, entitled The Ultimate Tour, ran from April to June 2006. The tour featured a guest appearance by British soul singer Beverley Knight, who replaced Lulu's vocals on the song \"Relight My Fire\"; although Lulu did appear during the stadium shows on \"Relight My Fire\" and \"Never Forget\".

Hayes auditioned for the role of Shaft but was asked to compose the musical score instead. \"Vulgar, shallow, and crudely done, Shaft distinguished itself mainly by having the best musical score of the year. Isaac Hayes's sensual, moody background music added to the texture of the film\u2026\" Hayes' soundtrack was known for its unique and catchy sound. \"Instead of laying out a series of lengthy, chilled-out raps and jams, the episodic nature of a movie structure obliged him to focus on shorter instrumentals, featuring laid-back, jazz-infused riffs and solos.\" For example, from the 'Theme from Shaft,' \"The instrumental section, played by the Bar Kays and Movement, deploys pulsating bass, stuttering wah-wah guitar, Hayes's own distinctive piano playing, a descending four-note horn motif, ascending flute runs and the now famous Pearl and Dean-style blasts of brass and strings.\" \"Thirty five years on, Shaft may sound dated, but it's a sound that inspired a generation of soul musicians. Hayes' laid back vocal delivery and the gorgeous arrangements by Johnny Allen are still breathtaking, and the album remains a quintessential slice of '70s soul.\" For Hayes' remarkable composition, he received a combination of public praise, notable critical reception, and awards. Only a few weeks after the release of the film, Hayes' soundtrack album had already earned $2\u00a0million and had gone platinum. \"The Shaft theme became so popular that it was heard everywhere, from nightclubs to halftime at football games.\" Hayes was also nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Dramatic Score and for Best Original Song with the 'Theme from Shaft.'. When he won for Best Original Song, it was the first time an African American composer had won an Academy Award. \"The 45-single release of the record topped the US charts, hit number 4 in the UK and is still popular today, enjoying a new lease of life as a cellphone ring tone.\" Sequels and reboot Shaft initially had two sequels called Shaft's Big Score! and Shaft in Africa , with \"neither capturing the soul of the original\", according to author Howard Hughes. An additional sequel, and part remake, was released in 2000, also called Shaft, starring Samuel L. Jackson as the title character, and Roundtree appearing as his \"Uncle\" John Shaft. The earlier sequels were followed by a short-lived 1973\u20131974 television series titled Shaft on CBS. Richard Roundtree was the only person to ever play John Shaft, appearing in all four films and the television series. Ernest Tidyman wrote six Shaft novel sequels, including Goodbye, Mr Shaft and Shaft's Carnival of Killers.

Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in styles of various composers, or would begin playing Moonlight Sonata, smoothly transitioning into the song. The documentary film The Corporation states that Warner/Chappell charged up to 10,000 for the song to appear in a film. Because of the copyright issue, filmmakers rarely showed complete singalongs of \"Happy Birthday\" in films, either substituting the public-domain \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" or avoiding using a song entirely. Before the song became subject to copyright claims it was used freely, as in Bosko's Party, a Warner Bros. cartoon of 1932, where a chorus of animals sings it twice through. The copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" is directly referenced in a 2009 episode of the TV series iCarly, \"iMake Sam Girlier\", in which the main character as well as others begin to sing the song to Sam but are prevented from doing so by Freddie, who says the song is not public domain; \"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\" is then sung instead. The Beatles recorded \"Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club\" for the BBC's radio programme's fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, released in 2013. In a 1998 episode of the television show Sports Night, \"Intellectual Property\", character Dan Rydell sings the song to his co-anchor during a telecast, forcing his network to pay royalties, and causing him to ask his colleagues to choose public-domain songs for him to sing for their birthdays. The copyright is also referenced frequently in a Disney A.N.T. Farm episode where characters repeatedly try to sing the song, only to be stopped by others reminding them of the price. The melody of the song is also featured in The Wrong Trousers but was replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" for DVD releases. The use of the song is a problem even if it is sung in a constructed language, as a Klingon-language version was nixed in pre-production from the 7th-season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \"Parallels\", replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" in Klingon. In the Futurama episode \"I Second That Emotion\", they poke fun at the song and its copyright by making their own version with the lyrics \"What day is today? / It's 's birthday / What a day for a birthday / Let's all have some cake / .\" In The Goldbergs episode \"Han Ukkah Solo\", Erica Goldberg is challenged to write a Hanukkah song. She does, but her words are sung to the tune of \"Happy Birthday To You\". Her music teacher tells her she cannot use it because \"I'd have to pay those old ladies hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I've already spent our budget on construction paper.\" In the 30 Rock episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\", TGS cast members begin to sing the song following an announcement about the royalty fee for singing \"Happy Birthday to You\" on a television show. The cast is interrupted after the first line by a character entering the scene. In the Community episode \"Mixology Certification\", a scene starts with the last two words of the song , implying it had been sung in its entirety, before Pierce confusedly asks, \"How come we only sang the last two words?\" In the 1987 documentary Eyes on the Prize about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which \"Happy Birthday to You\" was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film. In 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of \"Happy Birthday\" in the styles of various Western classical music composers including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles. On August 5, 2013, the first anniversary of its landing on Mars, NASA's Curiosity rover celebrated its \"birthday\" when engineers at Goddard Space Flight Center used the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument to cause the rover to \"sing\" Happy Birthday on the Martian surface. During the March 6, 2014 episode of the Comedy Central series The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert attempted to sing the song in honor of the 90th anniversary of its 1924 publication, but was prevented to due to the copyright issues. Colbert instead premiered his new \"royalty-free\" birthday song \u2013 which turns out to be a parody of the United States' national anthem, and ends with the stanza \"Warner Music can't sue me, and the home of the brave\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was nominated at the 44th Academy Awards in the Animated Short Subject category, one of only three films to receive a nomination. It was first broadcast in November that year. In the 1990s, the Australian team of composer Graeme Koehne and choreographer Graeme Murphy created a children's ballet based on The Selfish Giant. In 1992, the cartoonist P. Craig Russell adapted the story for Volume 1 of \"Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde\", which also includes \"The Star Child\". In the 1997 film Wilde, based on the life of the author, portions of The Selfish Giant are woven in, with Wilde and his wife telling the story to their children, the portions reflecting on his relationship with them and others: the sadness of the children who can no longer play in the giant's garden is reflected in that of Wilde's sons as their beloved father spends more time with his lovers than with them. In 2009, composer Stephen DeCesare adapted the \"Selfish Giant\" as a musical. In 2010, composer Dan Goeller wrote an orchestral interpretation of the story. That same year Chris Beatrice created new illustrations for the story. In 2011 they released a combination of a CD containing the orchestration and new narration by Martin Jarvis, plus the newly illustrated book.

{"id": "639_664", "question": "Who was the composer of Eclipse?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_15849", "text": "There is no direct evidence to indicate when King Lear was written or first performed.  It is thought to have been composed sometime between 1603 and 1606. A Stationers' Register entry notes a performance before James I on 26 December 1606. The 1603 date originates from words in Edgar's speeches which may derive from Samuel Harsnett's Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures . A significant issue in the dating of the play is the relationship of King Lear to the play titled The True Chronicle History of the Life and Death of King Leir and his Three Daughters, which was published for the first time after its entry in the Stationers' Register of 8 May 1605. This play had a significant effect on Shakespeare, and his close study of it suggests that he was using a printed copy, which suggests a composition date of 1605\u201306. Conversely, Frank Kermode, in the Riverside Shakespeare, considers the publication of Leir to have been a response to performances of Shakespeare's already-written play; noting a sonnet by William Strachey that may have verbal resemblances with Lear, Kermode concludes that \"1604\u201305 seems the best compromise\". A line in the play that regards \"These late eclipses in the sun and moon\" appears to refer to a phenomenon of two eclipses that occurred over London within a few days of each other\u2014the lunar eclipse of 27 September 1605 and the solar eclipse of 12 October 1605.  This remarkable pair of events stirred up much discussion among astrologers. Edmund's line \"A prediction I read this other day\u2026\" apparently refers to the published prognostications of the astrologers, which followed after the eclipses.  This suggests that those lines in Act I were written sometime after both the eclipses and the published comments. The modern text of King Lear derives from three sources: two quartos, one published in 1608 and the other in 1619 , and the version in the First Folio of 1623 . Q1 has \"many errors and muddles\". Q2 was based on Q1. It introduced corrections and new errors. Q2 also informed the Folio text. Quarto and Folio texts differ significantly. Q1 contains 285 lines not in F1; F1 contains around 100 lines not in Q1. Also, at least a thousand individual words are changed between the two texts, each text has different styles of punctuation, and about half the verse lines in the F1 are either printed as prose or differently divided in the Q1. Early editors, beginning with Alexander Pope, conflated the two texts, creating the modern version that has been commonly used since. The conflated version originated with the assumptions that the differences in the versions do not indicate any re-writing by the author; that Shakespeare wrote only one original manuscript, which is now lost; and that the Quarto and Folio versions contain various distortions of that lost original. In 2021, Duncan Salkeld endorsed this view, suggesting that Q1 was typeset by a reader dictating to the compositor, leading to many slips caused by mishearing. Other editors, such as Nuttall and Bloom, have suggested Shakespeare himself maybe was involved in reworking passages in the play to accommodate performances and other textual requirements of the play. As early as 1931, Madeleine Doran suggested that the two texts had independent histories, and that these differences between them were critically interesting. This argument, however, was not widely discussed until the late 1970s, when it was revived, principally by Michael Warren and Gary Taylor, who discuss a variety of theories including Doran's idea that the Quarto may have been printed from Shakespeare's foul papers, and that the Folio may have been printed from a promptbook prepared for a production. The New Cambridge Shakespeare has published separate editions of Q and F; the most recent Pelican Shakespeare edition contains both the 1608 Quarto and the 1623 Folio text as well as a conflated version; the New Arden edition edited by R.A. Foakes offers a conflated text that indicates those passages that are found only in Q or F. Both Anthony Nuttall of Oxford University and Harold Bloom of Yale University have endorsed the view of Shakespeare having revised the tragedy at least once during his lifetime. As Bloom indicates: \"At the close of Shakespeare's revised King Lear, a reluctant Edgar becomes King of Britain, accepting his destiny but in the accents of despair. Nuttall speculates that Edgar, like Shakespeare himself, usurps the power of manipulating the audience by deceiving poor Gloucester.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The game was directed by Takumi Nakazawa, planned and written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, and composed for by Takeshi Abo. Uchikoshi included science fiction elements, but was unable to make heavy use of use them, as his superiors at KID thought that the game needed to focus on cute female characters in to perform well commercially. Abo composed music based on his first impressions of reading the game's story, with a focus on its \"emotional flow\".

Now raising their two children alone, he is also facing friction at work around funding and support. His work up to this point - centering on aspects of the Oseberg Ship - has exhausted all of the available physical evidence. A meeting with funders in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo intended to increase support for ambitious fieldwork that isn't well substantiated in Finnmark ends badly. However his enthusiasm is undimmed, partially out of loyalty to his wife. He refers often to a notebook she kept, filled with maps, drawings and rune symbols related to the Norse culture. A breakthrough takes place when his co-worker Allan brings to him a stone tablet he found in Finnmark - the particular area in Northern Norway they've been focusing on. They determine that it holds a code, and identify an empty space in the center of the stone as exactly fitting a remnant from the ship. After they retrieve the ship remnant from the museum, they're able to break the code enough to translate most of the runic symbols on it and interpret it as a map of an island in a lake which may hold extensive relics and/or treasure. He decides to start his kids' summer vacation with them up in that area - doing on a smaller scale the work that they had been pursuing, with Allan and a small crew from the region. When Sigurd and Allan in Finnmark they meet up with Allan's field partner Elisabeth and hired guide Leif and set off hiking, eventually cutting an opening in a WWII-era fence erected by the Russians filled with signage warning against entering.  As they continue and Sigurd and Allan attempt to retrace the ancient journey, Leif brings them to the only lake for miles around, which surrounds a small island - identified as the \"Eye of Odin\". They are able to get across the water by means of a makeshift raft and oars, and they start to search for metal remnants. Exploring farther, Ragnhild finds a Russian barracks and Brage finds an immense cave. The party all descends via ropes into the cave and easily find a Vikings helmet and other objects.  Brage finds an interesting ovoid object in the shallow water and stows it in his rucksack for later.  The group's excitement is cut short when Leif demands the pieces at gunpoint and leaves, stranding the rest of the group  in the cave.  As he is paddling back across the lake in the raft he gets taken from below by an unseen thing.  Elisabeth climbs up the cave wall just using the crevices in the rock, and re-establishes the ropes so the others can climb out. Ragnhild asks Sigurd about the notebook and what is going on, and Sigurd explains that they think the King's daughter \u00c5sa left the message on the stone about the events that took place here. While Elisabeth, Brage and Ragnhild sleep in the bunker she found, Sigurd and Allan decide not to give up, and to go back in the cave alone.  They discover mass graves - not only of ancient skeletons but also including a Russian soldier - and realize that the stone tablet was not in fact a map but a warning, written by \u00c5sa, who refused to take part in her father's attempt to kill the still-living creature. The creature appears out of the water - a huge pebble-skinned sea serpent - reminiscent of the dragon heads of Viking ships. Sigurd understands the last bits of the message that had not made sense before - it was this creature that was being described. Meanwhile, Brage's \"rock\" is shown to be a hatching egg, from which emerges a baby serpent.  Elisabeth manages to capture it in an old metal box and latch it in.  The infant animal's squeals transmit down the bunker's cable into the water and alert an adult serpent who hauls the bunker into the lake, trying to rescue the baby.  Elisabeth and the children barely escape with everyone's efforts, inadvertently keeping the box with the baby creature with them. Allan finds the box as he gathers tools for their escape from the island, figures out how momentous it would be to bring it back alive, and decides to try and secretly keep it while they escape. Elisabeth shoots a zipline across the water to the mainland, and they take turns crossing it. They barely escape another serpent attack by Allan shooting it in the eye.  They find that the serpents are not exclusively water bound as they continue to attack the group,   barely escaping back into the underground Russian bunker system. They find a ceiling door out and Allan is first through the door, but then demands that the box be handed up to him before he passes down the rope. Sigurd, horrified, tries to argue but is complying when the serpent bursts from the background and takes Allan, then crashes down into the bunker tunnels.  The children, who were farther from the ceiling opening, run out of sight, but Elisabeth and Sigurd are knocked out cold. As the serpent eventually corners Sigurd's children, he comes to and realizes that returning the baby serpent will end the danger.  The sound of the baby's squeals distracts the adult serpent from the children and it accepts the infant serpent from Sigurd, slithering off without further harm.  The remaining party of four follow in \u00c5sa's footsteps, leaving the serpentand the newborn creature in peace.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Days pass and the prince learns that her manner is changed between the water and the land, and he can not marry her as she is on land. Princess Makemnoit, meanwhile, discovers that the Princess loves the lake so she sets out to dry it up. The water is drained from the lake, the springs are stopped up, and the rain ceases. Even babies no longer cry water. As the lake dries up, it is discovered that the only way to stop it is to block the hole the water is flowing from, and the only thing that will block it is a living man, who would die in the deed. The prince volunteers, on the condition that the princess keeps him company while the lake fills. The lake fills up. When the prince has almost drowned, the princess frantically drags his body from the lake to take it to her old nurse, who is a wise woman. They tend him through the night, and he wakes at dawn.

The plot derives from William Shakespeare's King Lear and includes segments based on legends of the daimy\u014d M\u014dri Motonari. The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons. The film is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of Ran in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for Ran. Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed Dersu Uzala in 1975, followed by Kagemusha in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film Ran. Ran was Kurosawa's third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed , based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. In 1960, he directed the film , based on Hamlet. Despite the changes in setting and language, all three films have received critical acclaim. As Kurosawa's last epic, Ran has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. With a budget of $11 million it was the most expensive Japanese film produced up to that time. Ran was previewed on  May 31, 1985, at the Tokyo International Film Festival before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color;  costume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work on Ran.

One day, Simon comes home from the grocery store to find an unconscious woman in Chance's bed. The film then goes back several months. Chance is annoyed when Rory, a struggling soap opera actor with whom Chance had a one-night stand, appears at her door and becomes emotional trying to convince her that they have a connection beyond just sex. Chance and Simon spin a story about meeting in a mental institution, which makes Rory uncomfortable enough to stop crying and to leave. Simon tricks Chance into answering a phone call from her mother by telling her that it is a man named Jack whom she was immediately attracted to when she met him at a nightclub. Her mother, Desiree, is calling to tell her that she is coming to visit. Trying to escape spending time with her mother, Chance persuades Simon to switch roles with her for the weekend and Simon spends time with Desiree pretending to be Chance until Desiree tells Simon that she needs to talk to Chance about something in particular. Desiree tells Chance that she is leaving Chance's father Malcolm, who is in a relationship with another woman named Heidi. Upset, Chance tells Simon about her parents' divorce and reveals that Desiree wants to stay with them for a while. Chance is suspicious when Simon tries to offer some comfort, and he begs again for $200 to pay off some unpaid parking tickets. Though hesitant to loan anyone money because of a bad experience with her first serious boyfriend, Chance agrees to give him the money for playing along with her charade for her mother. Uncomfortable with the idea of her mother living with her, Chance arranges for Desiree and her to have dinner with Malcolm and Heidi. Chance also invites Rory and, as Chance had hoped, Heidi is immediately smitten with him because she watches the soap opera in which he stars. When Rory manages to get Heidi out of the room, Chance asks her parents about the divorce. Malcolm reveals that Desiree had suggested that they experiment sexually with Heidi, and Desiree felt rejected when Heidi preferred him. Desiree insists that he seduced her, but Malcolm denies it. Malcolm says that while attractions may come and go he loves her. Chance goes out to a nightclub one night and meets a woman named Sara, who makes sexual advances on her. Chance brings Sara home with her, and after spending a day in bed together, Sara suggests that they take some drugs. Chance refuses and takes the drugs away. Chance leaves her apartment the next morning, and when she returns she finds Simon in her bedroom with Sara, who has apparently overdosed; Chance fears that Sara may have died from the drugs. Simon, overcome with emotion, kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, the two quickly begin to fight about the significance of the sex and Simon leaves the apartment. The next morning Chance awakes to find Sara, alive, sitting at the kitchen table. She thanks Chance for a place to sleep off the drugs and then leaves. Meanwhile, Simon runs into Jack, who recognizes him from the nightclub. When Simon realizes that Jack is hitting on him, he tells him that Chance has a crush on him and thinks that he is straight.

In 1959, the Cleftones' manager, George Goldner, convinced the group that their future resided in re-recording existing songs with an established popularity. By this time, Charles James had grown more proficient on the guitar, and the group and Goldner used that to develop a new arrangement of the piece. At that time, a local prominent disc jockey set up a recording session in Rochester, New York,  to record \"Heart and Soul\" and, arranged for singer Pat Spann's boyfriend Panama Francis to play drums and 15-year-old/future Grammy Award winner Duane Hitchings to play keyboards. At the recording session, the group was presented with a rearrangement of \"Heart and Soul\" that was more formal than they had practiced. The group added unexpected rhythms to give the song a syncopated feel. \"Heart and Soul\" sat undistributed until 1961.

Many reviewers directed their criticism at Diana Ross, who they believed was too old to play Dorothy. Most agreed that what had worked so successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen. Hischak's Through the Screen Door: What Happened to the Broadway Musical When It Went to Hollywood criticized \"Joel Schumacher's cockamamy screenplay\", and called \"Believe in Yourself\" the score's weakest song. He described Diana Ross's portrayal of Dorothy as: \"cold, neurotic and oddly unattractive\"; and noted that the film was \"a critical and box office bust\". In his work History of the American Cinema, Harpole characterized the film as \"one of the decade's biggest failures\", and, \"the year's biggest musical flop\". The Grove Book of Hollywood noted that \"the picture finished off Diana Ross's screen career\", as the film was Ross's final theatrical feature. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, Tom Shone referred to The Wiz as \"expensive crud\". In the book Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, the author criticized the script, noting, \"The Wiz was too scary for children, and too silly for adults.\" Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film, did not think highly of The Wiz, stating \"The Wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal that the classic MGM musical has obtained.\" Jackson's performance as the Scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed \"genuine acting talent\" and \"provided the only genuinely memorable moments.\" Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: \"I don't think it could have been any better, I really don't.\" In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was \"my greatest experience so far . . . I'll never forget that.\" Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film some of its most positive reviews on Sneak Previews. Siskel called it \"superior musical theater,\" said Diana Ross was \"superb,\" \"terrific\" and came across as \"a real star\" but had reservations about the film's \"heavy message.\" Ebert praised other cast members and numerous technical aspects of the film, saying it was \"fun\" and in the \"great tradition of the American musical.\" The film received another positive critique for its elaborate set design in the book American Jewish Filmmakers, which noted that it \"features some of the most imaginative adaptations of New York locales since the glory days of the Astaire-Rogers films.\" In a 2004 review of the film, Christopher Null wrote positively of Ted Ross and Richard Pryor's performances. However, Null's overall review of the film was critical, and he wrote that other than the song \"Ease on Down the Road\", \"the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing, garish sets, and a Joel Schumacher-scripted mess that runs 135 agonizing minutes.\" A 2005 piece by Hank Stuever in The Washington Post described the film as \"a rather appreciable delight, even when it's a mess\", and felt that the singing \u2013 especially Diana Ross's \u2013 was \"a marvel\". The New York Times analyzed the film within a discussion of the genre of blaxploitation: \"As the audience for blaxploitation dwindled, it seemed as if Car Wash and The Wiz might be the last gasp of what had been a steadily expanding black presence in mainstream filmmaking.\" The St. Petersburg Times noted, \"Of course, it only took one flop like The Wiz to give Hollywood an excuse to retreat to safer creative ground until John Singleton and Spike Lee came along. Yet, without blaxploitation there might not have been another generation of black filmmakers, no Denzel Washington or Angela Bassett, or they might have taken longer to emerge.\" The Boston Globe commented, \"the term 'black film' should be struck from the critical vocabulary. To appreciate just how outmoded, deceptive and limiting it is, consider the following, all of which have been described as black films, . . .\" and characterized The Wiz in a list that also featured 1970s films Shaft , Blacula , and Super Fly . Despite its lack of critical or commercial success in its original release, The Wiz became a cult classic, especially because it features Michael Jackson in his first starring theatrical film role. Jackson later starred in films such as Disney's Captain EO in 1986, the anthology film Moonwalker in 1988 and the posthumous documentary This Is It in 2009. As of November 2021, The Wiz holds a 41% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 34 reviews, with the consensus; \"This workmanlike movie musical lacks the electricity of the stage version , but it's bolstered by strong performances by Diana Ross and Michael Jackson.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The plot follows employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the Ponzi scheme of a Wall Street businessman and enlist the aid of a criminal, a bankrupt businessman, and an immigrant maid to break into his apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI agents in charge of his case. Tower Heist began development as early as 2005, based on an idea by Murphy that would star himself and an all-black cast of comedians as a heist group who rob Trump International Hotel and Tower.

In 1799 some of the settlers revolted. The Crown subdued the revolt by bringing in forces of more than 500\u00a0Jamaican Maroons, whom they transported from Cudjoe's Town via Nova Scotia in 1800. Led by Colonel Montague James, the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt, and in the process the Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone secured the best houses and farms. On 1 January 1808, Thomas Ludlam, the Governor of the Sierra Leone Company and a leading abolitionist, surrendered the company's charter. This ended its 16\u00a0years of running the Colony. The British Crown reorganised the Sierra Leone Company as the African Institution; it was directed to improve the local economy. Its members represented both British who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company, which held the monopoly on Sierra Leone trade. At about the same time , Royal Navy crews delivered thousands of formerly enslaved Africans to Freetown, after liberating them from illegal slave ships. These Liberated Africans or recaptives were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the Jamaican Maroons. Many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. For example, some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more Western sounding one. Though some people happily embraced these changes because they considered it as being part of the community, some were not happy with these changes and wanted to keep their own identity. Many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving Sierra Leone and going back to their original villages. They built a flourishing trade in flowers and beads on the West African coast. These Liberated Africans were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. During the 19th century, freed African Americans, some Americo Liberian 'refugees', and particularly Afro-Caribbeans, mainly Jamaican Maroons, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples created the Krio ethnicity  and an English-based creole language, , which is the lingua franca and de facto national language used among many of the ethnicities in the country. Colonial era The settlement of Sierra Leone in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans who were brought to the colony after the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807. Upon arrival in Sierra Leone, each recaptive was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities would be entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. However, oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track. In addition, differences between the Register of Liberated Africans of 1808 and the List of Captured Negroes of 1812 revealed some disparities in the entries of the recaptives, specifically in the names; many recaptives decided to change their given names to more anglicised versions which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in Sierra Leone. In the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region, who also administered the Gold Coast and the Gambia settlements. Sierra Leone developed as the educational centre of British West Africa. The British established Fourah Bay College in 1827, which rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in western Sub-Saharan Africa. Samuel Ajayi Crowther was the first student to be enrolled at Fourah Bay. Fourah Bay College soon became a magnet for Sierra Leone Creoles and other Africans seeking higher education in British West Africa. These included Nigerians, Ghanaians, Ivorians and many more, especially in the fields of theology and education. It was the first western-style university in West Africa. Under colonial rule, Freetown was known as the \"Athens of Africa\" due to the large number of excellent schools in Freetown and surrounding areas. The British interacted mostly with the Krios in Freetown, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. In addition, educated Krios held numerous positions in the colonial government, giving them status and well-paying positions. Following the Berlin Conference of 1884\u20131885, the British decided that they needed to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what was described by the European powers as \"effective occupation\" of territories. In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the Sierra Leone Protectorate. With this change, the British began to expand their administration in the region, recruiting British citizens to posts, and pushing Krios out of positions in government and even the desirable residential areas in Freetown. During the British annexation in Sierra Leone, several chiefs in the Northern and Southern parts of the country were resisting the \"hut tax\" imposed by the colonial administrators but they used diplomacy to achieve their goal. In the north, from 1820 to 1906, there was a Limba chief named Almamy Suluku who ruled his territory for many years, fighting different tribes to protect his territory, while at the same time using diplomacy to trick the protectorate administrators while sending fighters to assist Bai Bureh, a prominent Temne chief in Kasseh who was fighting against the imposition of the \"hut tax\" by the colonial administrators. The war is later known as the Hut Tax War. Another prominent figure in Sierra Leone history is Bai Sherbro . Bai Sherbro was a chief and warrior on Bonthe Island, in the southwestern part of the country. He, like Bai Bureh, exercised resistance against the British. Bai Sherbro also sent fighters to assist Bai Bureh in the fight against the British. Bai Sherbro was influential and powerful, so the British greatly feared him. Bai Sherbro was subsequently captured, and along with Bai Bureh exiled to the Gold Coast . Nyagua , also known as the \"Tracking King\", was a fierce king who captured many districts and many people came to join him for protection. Nyagua was also resistant to the British cause. However, realizing that he lacked sufficient strength, he resorted to use diplomacy. At the same time, he sent warriors to assist Bai Bureh in fighting against the British. The British later captured Nyagua, and he was also exiled to the Gold Coast. Madam Yoko was a brilliant woman of culture and ambition. She employed her capacity for friendly communications to persuade the British to give her control of the Kpaa Mende chiefdom. She used diplomacy to communicate with many local chiefs who did not trust her friendship with the British. Because Madam Yoko supported the British, some sub-chiefs rebelled, causing Yoko to take refuge in the police barracks. For her loyalty, she was awarded a silver medal by Queen Victoria. Until 1906, Madam Yoko ruled as a paramount chief in the new British Protectorate. Sadly, it appears that she committed suicide at the age of fifty-five, perhaps due to the loss of support from her own people. In addition, the British annexation of the Protectorate interfered with the sovereignty of indigenous chiefs. They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually as had been the previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longtime allies, such as Bai Bureh, who was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the Hut Tax War. Colonel Frederic Cardew, military governor of the Protectorate, in 1898 established a new tax on dwellings and demanded that the chiefs use their peoples to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew, stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes. Tensions over the new colonial requirements, and the administration's suspicions towards the chiefs, led to the Hut Tax war of 1898, also called the Temne-Mende War. The British fired first. The Northern front of majority Temne people was led by Bai Bureh. The Southern front, consisting mostly of Mende people, entered the conflict somewhat later for other reasons. For several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces, but the British troops and Bureh's warriors suffered hundreds of fatalities. Bai Bureh finally surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings. Although the British government recommended leniency, Cardew insisted on sending the chief and two allies into exile in the Gold Coast; his government hanged 96 of the chief's warriors. Bai Bureh was allowed to return in 1905, when he resumed his chieftaincy of Kasseh. The defeat of the Temne and Mende in the Hut Tax war ended mass resistance to the Protectorate and colonial government, but intermittent rioting and labour unrest continued throughout the colonial period. Riots in 1955 and 1956 involved \"tens of thousands\" of Sierra Leoneans in the Protectorate. Domestic slavery, which continued to be practised by local African elites, was abolished in 1928. A notable event in 1935 was the granting of a monopoly on mineral mining to the Sierra Leone Selection Trust, run by De Beers. The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country. In 1924, the UK government divided the administration of Sierra Leone into Colony and Protectorate, with different political systems constitutionally defined for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the hinterland areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most of the proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered that in the colony. The Krios, led by Isaac Wallace-Johnson, opposed the proposals, as they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the Krios in the Colony. In 1951, Lamina Sankoh collaborated with educated protectorate leaders from different groups, including Sir Milton Margai, Siaka Stevens, Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha, John Karefa-Smart, Kande Bureh, Sir Albert Margai, Amadu Wurie and Sir Banja Tejan-Sie joined together with the powerful paramount chiefs in the protectorate to form the Sierra Leone People's Party or SLPP as the party of the Protectorate. The SLPP leadership, led by Sir Milton Margai, negotiated with the British and the educated Krio-dominated colony based in Freetown to achieve independence. Owing to the astute politics of Milton Margai, the educated Protectorate elites were able to join forces with the paramount chiefs in the face of Krio intransigence. Later, Margai used the same skills to win over opposition leaders and moderate Krio elements to achieve independence from the UK. In November 1951, Margai oversaw the drafting of a new constitution, which united the separate Colonial and Protectorate legislatures and provided a framework for decolonisation. In 1953, Sierra Leone was granted local ministerial powers and Margai was elected Chief Minister of Sierra Leone. The new constitution ensured Sierra Leone had a parliamentary system within the Commonwealth of Nations. In May 1957, Sierra Leone held its first parliamentary election. The SLPP, which was then the most popular political party in the colony of Sierra Leone as well as being supported by the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces, won the most seats in Parliament and Margai was re-elected as Chief Minister by a landslide.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Chief among these are three films by Polish-French film-maker Roman Polanski: Repulsion , Cul-de-Sac , and The Tenant . These films employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently compared to that of Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: \"[I]t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else.\" By coincidence, Polanski was the head of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. \"Obviously\", Joel Coen said later, \"we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up\". Other works cited as influences for Barton Fink include the film The Shining , produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick, and the comedy Sullivan's Travels , written and directed by Preston Sturges. Set in an empty hotel, Kubrick's film concerns a writer unable to proceed with his latest work. Although the Coens approve of comparisons to The Shining, Joel suggests that Kubrick's film \"belongs in a more global sense to the horror film genre\". Sullivan's Travels, released the year in which Barton Fink is set, follows successful director John Sullivan, who decides to create a film of deep social import\u00a0\u2013  not unlike Barton's desire to create entertainment for \"the common man\". Sullivan eventually decides that comedic entertainment is a key role for film-makers, similar to Jack Lipnick's assertion at the end of Barton Fink that \"the audience wants to see action, adventure\". Additional allusions to films and film history abound in Barton Fink. At one point a character discusses \"Victor Soderberg\"; the name is a reference to Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, a Swedish director who worked in Hollywood under the name Seastrom. Charlie's line about how his troubles \"don't amount to a hill of beans\" is a probable homage to the film Casablanca . Another similarity is that of Barton Fink's beach scene to the final moment in La Dolce Vita , wherein a young woman's final line of dialogue is obliterated by the noise of the ocean. The unsettling emptiness of the Hotel Earle has also been compared to the living spaces in Key Largo and Sunset Boulevard .", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film follows married couple Joanna Reed and Michael Reed , who are tempted by different forms of infidelity when they spend a night apart following a fight. Joanna is emotionally drawn to her ex-boyfriend Alex Mann while Michael is physically attracted to his co-worker Laura Nunez . The cast includes Griffin Dunne, Daniel Eric Gold, Anson Mount, Stephanie Romanov, Scott Adsit, Justine Cotsonas, and Chriselle Almeida. Last Night was produced by Entertainment One in association with the Gaumont Film Company, and deals with questions about emotional and physical infidelity. The film was developed as a romance and suspense story before Tadjedin recognized its moral significance. After persuading Knightley to break a year-long acting hiatus to participate in the film, Tadjedin cast the other roles with consideration for the actors' chemistry. Mendes originally turned down the role of Laura but agreed to appear in the film after a conversation with Tadjedin. Scenes were filmed in SoHo, Manhattan, between 2008 and 2009 with Peter Deming as the director of photography. The soundtrack was composed by Clint Mansell, who received a World Soundtrack Award for Soundtrack Composer of the Year for his work. Miramax Films initially bought Last Night for a March 19, 2010 release, but it was delayed by the company's sale to Filmyard Holdings. The film was shown at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2010 Rome Film Festival. It premiered theatrically in France on February 16, 2011, and had a limited release in the United States on May 6, 2011. It was released through video on demand. Critics were divided over the film's plot and its commentary on infidelity; Deming's cinematography and performances from Knightley, Canet, and Mendes received praise while Worthington and the scenes between Michael and Laura were the subject of criticism.

The song is one of the most famous of the Second World War era, and resonated with soldiers going off to fight as well as their families and sweethearts. The song was published by Michael Ross Limited, whose directors included Louis Carris, Ross Parker and Norman Keen. Keen, an English pianist also collaborated with Parker and Hughie Charles on \"We'll Meet Again\" and many other songs published by the company, including \"There'll Always Be an England\" and \"I'm In Love For The Last Time\". The song's original recording featured Lynn accompanied by Arthur Young on Novachord , while a rerecording in 1953 featured a more lavish instrumentation and a chorus of British Armed Forces personnel. The song gave its name to the 1943 musical film We'll Meet Again in which Lynn played the lead role . Lynn's 1953 recording is featured in the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove \u2013 with a bitter irony, as the song accompanies a nuclear holocaust that wipes out humanity. It was also used in the closing scenes of the 1986 BBC television serial The Singing Detective. British director John Schlesinger used the song in his 1979 World War II film Yanks, which is about British citizens and American soldiers during the military buildup in the UK as the Allies prepare for the Normandy landings. During the Cold War, Lynn's recording was included in the package of music and programmes held in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service , designed to provide public information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack. The song reached number 29 on the U.S. charts.  Lynn sang the song in London on the 60th anniversary of VE Day in 2005. In April 2020, a charity duet with Katherine Jenkins, released in 2014, reached number 72 on the UK Singles Chart, with proceeds going to National Health Service charities.

L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson . The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of L\u00e9lio describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully. L\u00e9lio consists of six musical pieces presented by an actor who stands on stage in front of a curtain concealing the orchestra, chorus and solo singers.

It had a notable impact on the decade's popular fashions and set the tone for the evolution of police drama. Series such as Homicide: Life on the Street, NYPD Blue, and the Law & Order franchise, though being markedly different in style and theme from Miami Vice, follows its lead in breaking the genre's mold; Dick Wolf, creator and executive producer of the Law & Order franchise, was a writer and later executive producer of Miami Vice. Parodies and pastiches of it have continued decades after it airs, such as Only Fools and Horses Christmas episode Miami Twice and Moonbeam City . The video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, published by Rockstar Games in 2002, is heavily inspired by Miami Vice in multiple ways. It is set in a stylized 1980s Miami inspired fictional city named \"Vice City\". One of the main characters, Lance Vance, was actually voiced by Philip Michael Thomas. Two undercover police officers appear in a police sports car within the game when the player obtains a three-star wanted level. The two officers, one white and one black, resemble the two leading characters of Miami Vice. In the prequel, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, there are two officers in the multiplayer mode named Cracker and Butts, a parody of Crockett and Tubbs; these characters share the same role as the undercover cops in Vice City. Many of the fashion styles and trends popularized by the TV show, such as fast cars and speed boats, unshaven beard stubble, a T-shirt under pastel suits, no socks, rolled up sleeves, boat shoes and Ray Ban sunglasses symbolize the stereotypical image of 1980s fashion and culture. The show also had a lasting impact on Miami itself. It drew a large amount of media attention to the beginning revitalization of the South Beach and Art Deco District areas of Miami Beach, as well as other portions of Greater Miami, and increases tourism and investment. Even 30 years after Miami Vice first airs, it is still responsible for its share of tourist visits to the city. The fact that Crockett and Tubbs were Dade County officers and not City of Miami police represents the growing notion of metro government in Miami.

Although it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement, there is every reason to believe that Lully was in a hurry when writing this opera.  In effect, the opera reuses the interm\u00e8des from Moli\u00e8re's play.  Since these interm\u00e8des had met with such spectacular success seven years earlier, Lully must have felt that given his lack of time, he could at the very least attract a crowd with the promise of reviving the plainte italienne and the final divertissement.  All that was required was a synthesis of Moli\u00e8re's play that could coherently string together the already-existing interm\u00e8des.  Such a text would have to be one third the length of Moli\u00e8re's, that is to say 600 rather than 1800 lines long, and would have to be composed in varied rimes and rhythms rather than the alexandrines in riming couplets used in spoken declamation.  Unfortunately, Lully's usual librettist, Philippe Quinault, was in disgrace at court over his previous opera Isis and the task fell to Thomas Corneille, very likely at the bidding of the same cabal that had sought to disgrace Quinault.  Whether by choice or out of necessity, Corneille's text is not a synthesis of Moli\u00e8re's, but rather a profoundly different plot for a profoundly different genre. It is believed that Fontenelle, Thomas Corneille's nephew, collaborated on the text.  It is impossible to know whether or not this is true or, if true, to what extent Fontenelle participated.  All anecdotes speaking of Psych\u00e9 state that Thomas Corneille is the author without mentioning Fontenelle.  The latter, however, placed the libretto among his complete works, without the slightest mention of the participation of his uncle.  Conversely, none of Thomas Corneille's three opera librettos appear in any of the editions of his works or theatre.

{"id": "639_721", "question": "Who was the composer of Secret of Mana?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_26793", "text": "The original score for Secret of Mana was composed and produced by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure, was originally slated for the project, but was replaced with Kikuta after he had started on other projects, such as Romancing SaGa. Secret of Mana was Kikuta's first video game score, and he encountered difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the Super NES. Kikuta tried to express in the music two \"contrasting styles\" to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24\u00a0hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, \"immersive\" and \"three-dimensional\". Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta stated in 2001 that he considered the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation. The soundtrack's music includes both \"ominous\" and \"light-hearted\" tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and \"dark, solemn pianos\". Kikuta's compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from Bali. Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, \"Fear of the Heavens\", to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game's music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a \"whale noise\", rather than a traditional \"ping\", in order to try to \"more deeply connect\" the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the Super NES was a difficult technical challenge. An official soundtrack album, Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version, was released in Japan in August 1993, containing 44 musical tracks from the game. An English version, identical to the Japanese original aside from its localized packaging and track titles, was later released in North America in December 1994 as Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, making Secret of Mana one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release outside of Japan. An album of arranged music from Secret of Mana and its sequel Seiken Densetsu 3 was produced in 1993 as Secret of Mana+. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. Secret of Mana+ contains a single track, titled \"Secret of Mana\", that incorporates themes from the music of both Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was still under development at the time. The style of the album has been described by critics as \"experimental\", using \"strange sounds\" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and \"typing\" sounds. The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as \"Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians\". The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album. The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original Super NES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are \"how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it\", without the limitations of the Super NES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, noted that the differences were minor. Music for the 2018 remake, which features remastered versions of the original soundtrack, was overseen by Kikuta and arranged by numerous game composers, such as Yuzo Koshiro and Tsuyoshi Sekito. The soundtrack was released as an album, also titled Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, shortly after the remake's release in February 2018.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The three had previously worked together at 2K Games on BioShock 2: Minerva's Den. All three were drawn by the prospect of developing an exploration game influenced by Minerva's Den through a small independent team rather than a large company, and subsequently left 2K Games to form Fullbright. To reduce costs, the team moved into a house together in Portland, Oregon, and set up the office in the basement, with Gone Home being their first game. Gaynor considered their previous work on the BioShock games as effectively the pre-production stage for Gone Home, allowing them to complete it within seventeen months. The rapid development was aided by first prototyping the game in Amnesia: The Dark Descents HPL Engine 2 , before completing the game in the Unity 4 game engine. The game's budget was less than $200,000. The initial concept for Gone Home was for the player to explore a smart house that included a central artificial intelligence running everything with robots running around to complete tasks. The player would have been able to change the state of the house through their actions; Gaynor compared this idea to a non-combative System Shock game. As they explored this idea, and recognizing the small size of their team, they considered what would change if they made the house more like a regular household without any other characters visibly present, which significantly simplified the development into something more manageable for the team. This created the focus of the game as being \"no other people, no other characters, [just] you in a single environment\". The reduced scope allowed them to complete the game with the three of them for programming, narrative, and 2D art assets, along with remote work from Kate Craig for the game's 3D modeling. Particularly, the smaller scope eliminated the need for any type of character modeler or animator. Craig's wife Emily Carroll, a comic artist whom Gaynor was a fan of, also assisted by designing some of the game's art asset and logos. Narratively, Gone Home was designed around family; Gaynor had stated that for all the science fiction trappings of Minerva's Den, its core narrative was about a man, his wife, and how the man's past was affecting that relationship, and used the same approach for Gone Home. They placed the player as one of the members of the family to remove any type of morality of exploring a house that did not belong to them. Additionally, they established that the family had only recently moved into the home; Gaynor had worried that the player would have difficulty identifying key elements that would be present among all the other objects within a well lived-in home, while within a recent move, only objects of immediate importance would have been unpacked, making it easy for the player to focus on these. Fullbright set the game in 1995 because they considered it the most recent year in which technology had not made the majority of communication digital in nature, so that they did not have to account for how digital communication would affect their storytelling, while still keeping elements of the game familiar to players. Another source of inspiration was urban exploration, particularly Japanese haikyo, homes long abandoned due to industrialization. Gaynor said there were mysteries about its residents that people could put together from examining the state of the abandoned home. Gaynor stated that Minerva's Den was more focused on environmental storytelling than action-driven gameplay, and set the approach and necessary design elements they needed for Gone Home. Other elements that informed Gone Home from their BioShock experience was non-linear levels to explore, and discovering narrative elements through audio logs that the player would have to actively seek out, both which supported the exploration elements of the game. Gaynor also considered the approach that Looking Glass Studios used for developing immersive sims. One challenge that Fullbright considered was that not every player would necessarily find every narrative clue for the various plot elements, and so it was necessary for them to make the story flexible enough that the player could understand these narratives without necessarily seeing every element they designed. Gaynor was aware this approach to a game would be considered unconventional, so they did not set out to make something avant-garde but instead more as a proof of concept that such games could be immersive to draw the player in to fully explore and come to understand the narrative themselves. The game features music from the riot grrrl bands Heavens to Betsy and Bratmobile; Fullbright knew of their Portland-based label Kill Rock Stars, and worked early on with them to secure the rights to the music once they had settled on the locale and time period. After showing the game at Grrrl Front Fest, a Portland riot grrrl music festival, it attracted the attention of a local band, The Youngins, who went on to provide the music for Girlscout, the fictional band in the game. The game's original musical score was composed by Chris Remo, Gaynor's friend and co-host from the Idle Thumbs podcast, and featuring over 30 minutes of music that accompany the game's main exploration gameplay, with unique music also scored to each of the game's audio logs. A developer commentary mode was added as a free update to the game in October 2013.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Madonna reverses the concept of \"loss of love\" with her romantic idealization, according to Matthew Harden from Samesame.com.au, as the lyrics go \"When it all falls down, when it all falls down. We'll be two souls in a 'Ghosttown'.\" Jim Farber from New York Daily News said that the song brings out \"the warmest elements of [Madonna's] voice\" and \"at times, her alto [range] sounds like Karen Carpenter's, while the melody has the enveloping calm of hits like 'Live to Tell'\". The song's composition is \"uplifting\" and \"euphoric\" pop, electropop and electro, far-reaching with a number of melodic effects generated by electronic music. A cinematic visualization with the track is accomplished by different chord progressions, making the whole song sound compact. \"Ghosttown\" begins with sounds of single organ chords and a dusty drum beat. Instead of being a straight-up pop ballad, the composition sounds a little \"edgy\", due to the usage of synth percussion and vocoder effects. Chris Rosa from VH1 stated that the song \"features tight production and an ear-crashing chorus that is pure pop bliss\", while Elysa Gardner from USA Today described the song as a mixture of \"disarmingly earnest sweetness with a stark, chilly arrangement\". The chorus appears after 40 seconds in the song, with a distortion filled pause, a thumping beat and a repetitive chord progression. \"Ghosttown\" is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 79 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from F3 to B4. The song has a basic sequence of Dm\u2013F\u2013C\u2013Gm during the verses and B\u2013F\u2013C\u2013Dm during the chorus as its chord progression. Demacio \"Demo\" Castellon engineered and mixed the track, while Ron Taylor did additional Pro Tools editing of Madonna's vocals and Evignan provided background vocals on the song. On March 31, 2015, Billboard premiered a remix of the song by Dutch DJ Don Diablo, who changed the ballad into an EDM track. Another set of remixes were released later as a Remix EP. Two of the remixes were released on Madonna's Tidal streaming account, including one by DJ RedTop as well as Armand Van Helden, Offer Nissim and Roger Sanchez. According to Idolator, \"RedTop completely deconstructs 'Ghosttown' and turns it into something you might hear in a post-apocalyptic piano bar. It's sad and depressing yet defiantly groovy.\" Another remix, by Paul Andrews, gave emphasis on Madonna's vocals while adding piano and orchestra in the production. Andrews explained that the music video of \"Ghosttown\" was how he had imagined it, \"two people in a dark place with destruction all around them, but they have each other\". Hence he wanted the verse to represent the reality of the situation and the chorus would represent their view of the world because of their love. The non-dance remix was approved by Madonna and was another exclusive release to her Tidal account.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were inspired by the composer's unhappy love affairs, the symphony by Harriet Smithson, L\u00e9lio by Marie Moke, who had broken off her engagement to Berlioz in order to marry Camille Pleyel, prompting the composer to contemplate suicide. L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson . The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of L\u00e9lio describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully.

From Paris, he fulfilled the obligation to write the opera Il corsaro from a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave which took place in Trieste in October 1848. Also, he worked with Salvadore Cammarano on two librettos, one for La battaglia di Legnano , the other being Luisa Miller which was presented in Naples in December 1849 after Verdi's return to Italy. Many writers, including Baldini and Frank Walker, have speculated on supposed relationships which Verdi, a man then close to his thirties, might have had with women in the years following his first wife's death.  However, the only real evidence, visible in Walker's The Man Verdi and Baldini's The Story of Giuseppe Verdi, relates to Giuseppina Strepponi, the singer who Verdi first encountered at the time he was writing Nabucco in 1842.  She sang the first Abigaille, and continued on and off with that role in spite of her declining voice up to her retirement and move to Paris in October 1846 where she became a singing teacher in November and also planned a concert of Verdi's music for the following June. It is known that the two had conducted friendly correspondence over several years and that Strepponi had offered various pieces of advice to the composer. As is known, Verdi and Emanuele Muzio had arrived in Paris on 2 June 1847 en route to London for I masnadieri, and the composer had sent Muzio on to London to make sure that Jenny Lind, about whom rumours of her reluctance to come to England abounded, was already present and ready to go to work.  While Verdi remained in the city, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz in her massive biography of the composer, speculates that Verdi saw her in the three days he was present,. On 27 July 1847, having left London, Verdi returned to Paris. To friends in Italy, he had written from London about \"being able to lead the life I wish\" and \"intend[ing] to stay a month in Paris, if I liked it\".  With the exception of a return to Italy after the 18 March 1848 bloody uprising in Milan against the Austrians and the period of overseeing the rehearsals of La battaglia di Legnano in Rome , Verdi remained in Paris. However, as far as the relationship with Strepponi proceeded, Phillips-Matz recounts that Verdi was \"living in an apartment around the corner from Strepponi's house\", that the news of this had reached Italy , and that, in writing the music for J\u00e9rusalem, he had received her help to the extent that a handwritten love duet in the composer's autograph score contains alternative lines in her handwriting and in his. This is described by British music critic Andrew Porter as \"one of the more romantic discoveries of recent years\". Baldini tells us that \"at the end of 1847 Verdi rented a little house in Passy, and went to live there with Giuseppina\", but Phillips-Matz does not go so far, noting only that \"he may have moved into her apartment or a separate apartment in her building\", but later does confirm the move to Passy, dating it to June 1848. However, the couple were to remain together for many years, and when the time came to leave Paris, Verdi left in late July and \"made straight for Busseto to wait for her there\", while it appear that Strepponi visited her family in Florence and Pavia before joining him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With the combined influence of \"Cloud Piece\" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as \"a humanistic paean for the people\". Blaney wrote, \"Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential.\" Rolling Stones David Fricke commented: \"[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class.\" Lennon stated: \"'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\" He told NME: \"There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism.\" Ono described the lyrical statement of \"Imagine\" as \"just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people.\" Rolling Stone described its lyrics as \"22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself\". The original piano musical motif was created in January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions. Lennon finished composing \"Imagine\" one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session. Described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C.

His 1995 film Telephones forms a narrative out of clips from Hollywood films where characters use a telephone. It was a link between Marclay's audio and video art, and its discontinuous structure was a template for The Clock. Telephones broke using a telephone into several discrete steps, each reenacted by multiple films, similar to sequences in The Clock where the act of sleeping or waking is demonstrated by one character after another. His 1998 film Up and Out combines video from Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup with audio from Brian De Palma's Blow Out. It was an early experiment in the effect of synchronization, where viewers naturally attempted to find intersections between the two works, and it developed the editing style that Marclay employs for The Clock. His 2002 installation Video Quartet is a 13-minute video with four continuous screens of clips from commercial films. Its combinations of coinciding sounds and images were a model for the synchronicity of The Clock. The Clock has been viewed as an extension of similar compilations, particularly by Christoph Girardet. Girardet's 1999 Phoenix Tapes, a collaboration with Matthias M\u00fcller, is composed of footage from Alfred Hitchcock's films. It arranges them into clusters to illustrate Hitchcock's techniques and motifs. Girardet and M\u00fcller use low-quality footage from VHS tapes to draw attention to their appropriation.

Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\". Richard Burton was the first choice to play Charlie, but it was thought that his fee would push the budget too high, so Bogarde was cast in the role. The juvenile cast was led by Pamela Franklin, who had worked with Clayton in The Innocents. Yootha Joyce had worked with Clayton in an acclaimed cameo role in Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . Our Mother's House is the second in a loose trilogy of films in which Clayton explored themes of the occult and of children in isolated situations who are threatened by evil. He most famously essayed these subjects in The Innocents, his acclaimed adaptation of Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\", and he returned to it in the 1980s with his screen adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes . In his 1975 memoir, Dirk Bogarde recounted his experience with the production in glowing terms: \"On my first morning in the gloomy house in Croydon I was in a bit of a funk. Eight pairs of eyes, ranging from five to fourteen, gazed at me solemnly. Not a smile, no welcoming grin even. In the little caravan in the scrubby front garden which I had been given to change in there was a jam jar stuffed with privet and some wilting Michaelmas daisies. Under it was a note. 'Let's hope you're as good as you're cracked up to be. You'd better be. Sincerely, The Children.' \"I loved every second of the film, which was one of the happiest I have ever made.\" Our Mother's House was also the second of five collaborations between Clayton and noted French composer Georges Delerue, who had written the score for Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . 16 years after making Our Mother's House, Clayton and Delerue reunited for Something Wicked This Way Comes , but that production was troubled, with the studio forcing Clayton to replace Delerue's original music with a new score by James Horner. Delerue composed the music for Clayton's last two projects: The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne and the TV movie Memento Mori .", "hasanswer": false}]}

Among the Trouv\u00e8res of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established. In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music. Romantic-era composers include Hector Berlioz , Charles Gounod , Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , L\u00e9o Delibes and Jules Massenet , among others. Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon. Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy , Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel . Several foreign-born composers, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin , Franz Liszt , Jacques Offenbach , Niccol\u00f2 Paganini , and Igor Stravinsky , established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris. Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourr\u00e9e to the accompaniment of the cabrette and often the vielle \u00e0 roue in the caf\u00e9s and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and caf\u00e9s. Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city. Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s. Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll. Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the caf\u00e9s of the city at night. Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord. Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine. The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967. On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf\u2014a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars. Other singers\u2014of similar style\u2014include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet. Paris has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s.

They can either be made up of large geographical regions of churches or churches that are grouped and organized together as their own separate jurisdictions because of similar affiliations, regardless of geographical location or dispersion. Each state in the U.S. has at least one jurisdiction while others may have several more, and each jurisdiction is usually composed of between 30 and 100 churches. Each jurisdiction is then broken down into several districts, which are smaller groups of churches which are each under the authority of District Superintendents who answer to the authority of their jurisdictional/state bishop. There are currently over 170 jurisdictions in the United States, and over 30 jurisdictions in other countries. The bishops of each jurisdiction, according to the COGIC Manual, are considered to be the modern day equivalent in the church of the early apostles and overseers of the New Testament church, and as the highest ranking clergymen in the COGIC, they are tasked with the responsibilities of being the head overseers of all religious, civil, and economic ministries and protocol for the church denomination. They also have the authority to appoint and ordain local pastors, elders, ministers, and reverends within the denomination. The bishops of the COGIC denomination are all collectively called \"The Board of Bishops\". From the Board of Bishops, and the General Assembly of the COGIC, the body of the church composed of clergy and lay delegates that are responsible for making and enforcing the bylaws of the denomination, every four years, twelve bishops from the COGIC are elected as \"The General Board\" of the church, who work alongside the delegates of the General Assembly and Board of Bishops to provide administration over the denomination as the church's head executive leaders. One of twelve bishops of the General Board is also elected the \"presiding bishop\" of the church, and two others are appointed by the presiding bishop himself, as his first and second assistant presiding bishops. Bishops in the Church of God in Christ usually wear black clergy suits which consist of a black suit blazer, black pants, a purple or scarlet clergy shirt and a white clerical collar, which is usually referred to as \"Class B Civic attire\". Bishops in COGIC also typically wear the Anglican Choir Dress style vestments of a long purple or scarlet chimere, cuffs, and tippet worn over a long white rochet, and a gold pectoral cross worn around the neck with the tippet. This is usually referred to as \"Class A Ceremonial attire\". The bishops of COGIC alternate between Class A Ceremonial attire and Class B Civic attire depending on the protocol of the religious services and other events they have to attend. Church of God In the polity of the Church of God , the international leader is the presiding bishop, and the members of the executive committee are executive bishops. Collectively, they supervise and appoint national and state leaders across the world. Leaders of individual states and regions are administrative bishops, who have jurisdiction over local churches in their respective states and are vested with appointment authority for local pastorates.

The Super NES's sound hardware allowed the playback of samples simultaneously on eight channels, as opposed to three PSG channels and one noise channel of the NES. Yamamoto decided that rich and expressive sounds, such as a female chorus, would be required to portray the setting realistically. He composed the main theme by humming while riding his motorcycle from work. Yamamoto also served as a sound programmer, and wrote a program that sends sound data to the audio chip. He also created sound effects, including those created for an infant Metroid to convey different emotions. The simultaneous roles as a composer, a sound programmer and a sound effect creator gave Yamamoto ideas to produce a distinct Metroid soundtrack \"with a sound programmer's ear, with a sound effect creator's ear, and with the approach methodology and theory of a composer.\" The arrangements and remixes of the game's themes were used in Metroid Prime and its sequels, because Yamamoto wanted to satisfy old Metroid fans, describing it as a \"present\" for them.

Maurice Ravel uses this chord in his piano work Jeux d'eau to create flourishing, water-like sounds that characterize the piece. In his article \"Ravel's 'Russian' Period: Octatonicism in His Early Works, 1893-1908\", Steven Baur notes that Jeux d'eau was composed in 1901, ten years before Stravinsky composed Petrushka , suggesting that Stravinsky may have learned the trick from Ravel.  Stravinsky heard Jeux d'eau and several other works by Ravel no later than 1907 at the \"Evenings for Contemporary Music\" program. Stravinsky used the chord repeatedly throughout the ballet Petrushka to represent the puppet and devised the chord to represent the puppet's mocking of the crowd at the Shrovetide Fair.

{"id": "639_746", "question": "Who was the composer of Super?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_26793", "text": "The original score for Secret of Mana was composed and produced by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure, was originally slated for the project, but was replaced with Kikuta after he had started on other projects, such as Romancing SaGa. Secret of Mana was Kikuta's first video game score, and he encountered difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the Super NES. Kikuta tried to express in the music two \"contrasting styles\" to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24\u00a0hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, \"immersive\" and \"three-dimensional\". Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta stated in 2001 that he considered the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation. The soundtrack's music includes both \"ominous\" and \"light-hearted\" tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and \"dark, solemn pianos\". Kikuta's compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from Bali. Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, \"Fear of the Heavens\", to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game's music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a \"whale noise\", rather than a traditional \"ping\", in order to try to \"more deeply connect\" the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the Super NES was a difficult technical challenge. An official soundtrack album, Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version, was released in Japan in August 1993, containing 44 musical tracks from the game. An English version, identical to the Japanese original aside from its localized packaging and track titles, was later released in North America in December 1994 as Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, making Secret of Mana one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release outside of Japan. An album of arranged music from Secret of Mana and its sequel Seiken Densetsu 3 was produced in 1993 as Secret of Mana+. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. Secret of Mana+ contains a single track, titled \"Secret of Mana\", that incorporates themes from the music of both Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was still under development at the time. The style of the album has been described by critics as \"experimental\", using \"strange sounds\" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and \"typing\" sounds. The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as \"Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians\". The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album. The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original Super NES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are \"how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it\", without the limitations of the Super NES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, noted that the differences were minor. Music for the 2018 remake, which features remastered versions of the original soundtrack, was overseen by Kikuta and arranged by numerous game composers, such as Yuzo Koshiro and Tsuyoshi Sekito.

Kennedy in May 1962. Another notable use was by comedy pianist Victor Borge, who played the song in styles of various composers, or would begin playing Moonlight Sonata, smoothly transitioning into the song. The documentary film The Corporation states that Warner/Chappell charged up to 10,000 for the song to appear in a film. Because of the copyright issue, filmmakers rarely showed complete singalongs of \"Happy Birthday\" in films, either substituting the public-domain \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" or avoiding using a song entirely. Before the song became subject to copyright claims it was used freely, as in Bosko's Party, a Warner Bros. cartoon of 1932, where a chorus of animals sings it twice through. The copyright status of \"Happy Birthday to You\" is directly referenced in a 2009 episode of the TV series iCarly, \"iMake Sam Girlier\", in which the main character as well as others begin to sing the song to Sam but are prevented from doing so by Freddie, who says the song is not public domain; \"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\" is then sung instead. The Beatles recorded \"Happy Birthday Dear Saturday Club\" for the BBC's radio programme's fifth anniversary. This recording is included on the compilation album On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, released in 2013. In a 1998 episode of the television show Sports Night, \"Intellectual Property\", character Dan Rydell sings the song to his co-anchor during a telecast, forcing his network to pay royalties, and causing him to ask his colleagues to choose public-domain songs for him to sing for their birthdays. The copyright is also referenced frequently in a Disney A.N.T. Farm episode where characters repeatedly try to sing the song, only to be stopped by others reminding them of the price. The melody of the song is also featured in The Wrong Trousers but was replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" for DVD releases. The use of the song is a problem even if it is sung in a constructed language, as a Klingon-language version was nixed in pre-production from the 7th-season episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called \"Parallels\", replaced with \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" in Klingon. In the Futurama episode \"I Second That Emotion\", they poke fun at the song and its copyright by making their own version with the lyrics \"What day is today? / It's 's birthday / What a day for a birthday / Let's all have some cake / .\" In The Goldbergs episode \"Han Ukkah Solo\", Erica Goldberg is challenged to write a Hanukkah song. She does, but her words are sung to the tune of \"Happy Birthday To You\". Her music teacher tells her she cannot use it because \"I'd have to pay those old ladies hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I've already spent our budget on construction paper.\" In the 30 Rock episode \"Goodbye, My Friend\", TGS cast members begin to sing the song following an announcement about the royalty fee for singing \"Happy Birthday to You\" on a television show. The cast is interrupted after the first line by a character entering the scene. In the Community episode \"Mixology Certification\", a scene starts with the last two words of the song , implying it had been sung in its entirety, before Pierce confusedly asks, \"How come we only sang the last two words?\" In the 1987 documentary Eyes on the Prize about the U.S. civil rights movement, there was a birthday party scene in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s discouragement began to lift. After its initial release, the film was unavailable for sale or broadcast for many years because of the cost of clearing many copyrights, of which \"Happy Birthday to You\" was one. Grants in 2005 for copyright clearances allowed PBS to rebroadcast the film. In 2010, the Western classical music conductor Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra to play variations of \"Happy Birthday\" in the styles of various Western classical music composers including Wagner, Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, and in the Viennese, New Orleans and Hungarian composition styles.

Under Proksch, however, Smetana acquired more polish, as revealed in works such as the G minor Sonata of 1846 and the E-flat Polka of the same year. The set of Six Characteristic Pieces of 1848 was dedicated to Liszt, who described it as \"the most outstanding, finely felt and finely finished pieces that have recently come to my note.\" In this period Smetana planned a cycle of so-called \"album leaves\", short pieces in every major and minor key, after the manner of Chopin's Preludes. The project became somewhat disorganised; in the pieces completed, some keys are repeated while others are unrepresented. After Smetana's final return from Gothenburg, when he committed himself primarily to the development of Czech opera, he wrote nothing for the piano for 13\u00a0years. In his last decade Smetana composed three substantial piano cycles. The first, from 1875, was entitled Dreams. It was dedicated to former pupils of Smetana's, who had raised funds to cover medical expenses, and is also a tribute to the composer's models of the 1840s\u2014Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. Smetana's last major piano works were the two Czech Dances cycles of 1877 and 1879.

It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord. French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz , Georges Bizet , Gabriel Faur\u00e9 , Charles Gounod , Jacques Offenbach , \u00c9douard Lalo , Jules Massenet and Werther ) and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3). Later came precursors of modern classical music. \u00c9rik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnop\u00e9dies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels , the ballet Les biches , the Concert champ\u00eatre for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and the Gloria for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Bol\u00e9ro . More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music. French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson fran\u00e7aise, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir D\u00e9sir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira, or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, Aliz\u00e9e and Nolwenn Leroy, electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s , electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world. Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera , the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organised, the most popular being Eurock\u00e9ennes , Solidays and Rock en Seine. The F\u00eate de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French Government in 1982.

Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter in his directorial debut, and executive produced by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton. The film centers on two monsters James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc., which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when a little human girl sneaks into the factory, she must be returned home before it's too late. Docter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon and Ralph Eggleston. Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Daniel Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to simulate fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose for its fourth. Upon its release on November 2, 2001, Monsters, Inc. received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, grossing over $577\u00a0million worldwide to become the third highest-grossing film of 2001. The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"If I Didn't Have You\" and was nominated for the first Best Animated Feature, but lost to DreamWorks' Shrek, and was also nominated for Best Original Score and Best Sound Editing. Monsters, Inc. saw a 3D re-release in theaters on December 19, 2012. A prequel titled Monsters University, which was directed by Dan Scanlon, was released on June 21, 2013.

Upon waking, he hurried to a piano and played the tune to avoid forgetting it. McCartney's initial concern was that he had subconsciously plagiarised someone else's work. As he put it, \"For about a month I went round to people in the music business and asked them whether they had ever heard it before. Eventually it became like handing something in to the police. I thought if no one claimed it after a few weeks then I could have it.\" Upon being convinced that he had not copied the melody, McCartney began writing lyrics to suit it. As Lennon and McCartney were known to do at the time, a substitute working lyric, titled \"Scrambled Eggs\" , was used for the song until something more suitable was written. During the shooting of Help!, a piano was placed on one of the stages where filming was being conducted and McCartney took advantage of this opportunity to tinker with the song. Richard Lester, the director, was eventually greatly annoyed by this and lost his temper, telling McCartney to finish writing the song or he would have the piano removed. The patience of the other Beatles was also tested by McCartney's work in progress; George Harrison summed this up when he said: \"Blimey, he's always talking about that song. You'd think he was Beethoven or somebody!\" McCartney originally claimed he had written \"Yesterday\" during the Beatles' tour of France in 1964; however, the song was not released until the summer of 1965. During the intervening time, the Beatles released two albums, A Hard Day's Night and Beatles for Sale, each of which could have included \"Yesterday\". Although McCartney has never elaborated on his claims, a delay may have been due to a disagreement between McCartney and George Martin regarding the song's arrangement, or the opinion of the other Beatles who felt it did not suit their image. Lennon later indicated that the song had been around for a while before: McCartney said the breakthrough with the lyrics came during a trip to Portugal in May 1965: On 27 May 1965, McCartney and Asher flew to Lisbon for a holiday in Albufeira, Algarve, and he borrowed an acoustic guitar from Bruce Welch, in whose house they were staying, and completed the work on \"Yesterday\". The song was offered as a demo to Chris Farlowe before the Beatles recorded it, but he turned it down as he considered it \"too soft\". In a March 1967 interview with Brian Matthew, McCartney said that Lennon came up with the word that would replace \"scrambled eggs\": Yesterday.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_769", "question": "Who was the composer of Discipline?", "ctxs": [{"id": "422_12897", "text": "Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences. From traditional folk music, to classical and modern rock, Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians including Kirill Karabits, Okean Elzy and Ruslana. Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into modern jazz. Ukrainian music sometimes presents a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals. During the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as being accomplished players of the kobza, bandura or torban. The first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv in 1738 and students were taught to sing and play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result, many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv or having been closely associated with this music school. See: Dmytro Bortniansky, Maksym Berezovsky and Artemiy Vedel. Ukrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the Ukrainian diaspora. The music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for whom they cater. Since the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player Mariana Sadovska is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups and performers like Vopli Vidoplyasova, Dakh Daughters, Dakha Brakha, Ivan Dorn and Okean Elzy. Modern musical culture of Ukraine is presented both with academic and entertainment music. Ukraine has five conservatories, 6 opera houses, five houses of Chamber Music, Philharmony in all regional centers. Ukraine hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 and the Eurovision Song Contest 2017.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He describes the process as expressing each memory as an individual story. Ryo composed the songs on the album around the idea of starting and ending with \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" . As such, the second track on the album is \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", and the final track \"Watashi e\" uses the same tune. For \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", Ryo was offered to compose the ending theme song to the 2009 anime series Bakemonogatari. Ryo did not want to copy the tone or style of the original Bakemonogatari novels, because he felt the author Nisio Isin would enjoy the song more if it was more original. Thus, Ryo wrote a different story after borrowing the general setting of the novels. While creating the album, Ryo thought it would be interesting if the first song on the album was the end of the story. The album's first track \"Owari e Mukau Hajimari no Uta\" was composed with the image of starting with a flashback scene, diving into the past, and once again returning to the present. For \"Hero\", Ryo was asked to compose a theme song for Shueisha's manga magazine Aoharu, a special edition version of Young Jump. The artists whose manga would be serialized in Aoharu were asked to draw \"heroines they think are cute,\" and Ryo was asked to compose the song with the same theme. Ryo thought of a boy aiming to be a manga artist as the song's protagonist, and wrote it with the concept of wanting to support those who get victimized for being otaku. Since the song reflects different points of view between the protagonist and the heroine, Nagi Yanagi switches her singing style from cool to cute sounding. Ryo describes \"Perfect Day\" with an image close to the album title and feels the song symbolizes the album. \"Perfect Day\" was born from the nuance that undoubtedly tomorrow will be a perfect day. Ryo wrote the song \"Fukush\u016b\" with the theme of anger, and was influenced by \"Snow White\" to include a line in the song describing someone being told to wear red hot iron shoes and dance. Ryo wanted a song to describe emotions that would continue past adolescence, compared to the rest of the songs on the album. Yanagi found it difficult to capture the right emotions in the song. \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\" was composed with a strong drum component as the initial concept and Ryo wanted to create a song with a fast tempo and rock and roll nuance to it; the song's tempo is over 200 beats per minute. Ryo worked in collaboration with Yanagi to write the song based on the initial demo. Ryo did not initially intend on putting \"Love & Roll\" on the album, but others in the staff convinced him to include it. For the middle of the album, Ryo wanted a lower tempo song with a different mood and composed \"Feel So Good\" based on this concept. When it was decided Ryo would compose the theme song to Type-Moon's visual novel Mah\u014dtsukai no Yoru, he first read the original novel by Kinoko Nasu the visual novel is based on to get a feel for the work. Ryo wrote \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" for the theme song, and there was not much trial and error in the composition of this song. Fireworks were an influence in the writing of \"Utakata Hanabi\" . Ryo wanted the song to reflect how fireworks, which are initially brilliant, are hard to vividly remember afterwards. \"Yoru ga Akeru yo\" was the last song on the album Ryo composed, and was born from the feeling of lying in bed being unable to sleep. Ryo was inspired by the layout of the room where he works and how when dawn is breaking, the temperature slowly starts to rise, and a school near his home starts to bustle. Since \"Sayonara Memories\" was initially released in February 2010, Ryo used that month as the song's theme. He attempted to write a song that reflected February as the time of year in Japan when people are reminded of farewells they made the previous year, as well as the time when people think about meeting others for the first time. The last song \"Watashi e\" is meant to convey perseverance through tough times. While Ryo writes all the music, an assortment of session musicians perform the songs on the album, including four guitarists and bassists, five drummers, three pianists, and a violinist. Ryo cites drummer Masayuki Muraishi as an influence in the composition of \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\"; Muraishi contributes on several songs on the album. In composing \"Feel So Good\", Ryo employed bassist Kenji Hino, son of Terumasa Hino, after he became interested in a performance of his on a TV music program. Ryo felt using strings in \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" was an essential part of the song; Crusher Kimura provides the strings for three songs on the album. Haruko Ohinata is credited for the chorus of the song \"Utakata Hanabi\".

Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs\u2014particularly marches\u2014and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers. By the late 19th century, the Second New England School became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives' work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin\u2014eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein\u2014developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters, and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston. Popular artists from the mid-1990s to late 2000s include Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Beyonc\u00e9.

Numitor's younger brother Amulius seized the throne and killed Numitor's son, then forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, a priestess of the goddess Vesta. As Vestal Virgins were sworn to celibacy, this would ensure the line of Numitor had no heirs. Rhea, however, became pregnant with the twins Romulus and Remus by the god Mars. According to Plutarch, she believed this because she saw her children being cared for by a wood pecker and a wolf \u2013 animals sacred to Mars. The account says that Rhea Silvia went to a grove sacred to Mars to get water for use in the temple where she encountered Mars who attempted to rape her, she ran into a cave to escape him but to no avail. Mars then promised that her children would be great. These claims of her children's paternity were later doubted by the Roman historian Livy. Vesta, to show her displeasure at the birth of Rhea Silvia's children, caused the holy fire in her temple to go out, shook her altar, and shut the eyes of her image. According to Ennius, the goddess Venus was more sympathetic to Rhea Silvia's plight. When Amulius learned of the birth he imprisoned Rhea Silvia and ordered a servant to kill the twins. But the servant showed mercy and set them adrift on the river Tiber, which, overflowing, left the infants in a pool by the bank. There, a she-wolf , who had just lost her own cubs, suckled them.

{"id": "639_778", "question": "Who was the composer of Cue Ball Cat?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24524", "text": "Shortly after the Sydmonton Festival, Lloyd Webber began setting the unpublished poems he had been given to music, a few of which were later added into the show. He also composed the overture and \"The Jellicle Ball\", incorporating analog synthesizers into these orchestrations to try to create a unique electronic soundscape. Meanwhile, Mackintosh recruited Nunn, the then artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company , to direct Practical Cats. Nunn was an unusual choice as he was considered \"too high-brow\" for musical theatre, but Mackintosh felt that a \"pedigree\" director was needed to ensure Valerie Eliot's approval of the project. After much persuasion, Nunn came on board and was joined by his RSC colleagues, choreographer Gillian Lynne and set and costume designer John Napier. Nunn initially envisioned Practical Cats as a chamber piece for five actors and two pianos, which he felt would reflect \"Eliot's charming, slightly offbeat, mildly satiric view of late-1930s London\". However, he relented to Lloyd Webber's more ambitious vision for the musical. Nunn was also convinced that for the musical to have the wide commercial appeal that the producers desired, it could not remain as a series of isolated numbers but instead had to have a narrative through line. He was therefore tasked with piecing the self-contained poems together into a story. Nunn wrote about the significance \"Grizabella the Glamour Cat\" had on the construction of the narrative: An event called the Jellicle Ball was referenced by Eliot in the poem \"The Song of the Jellicles\", while a cat version of heaven known as the Heaviside Layer was mentioned in one of his unpublished poems. Nunn expanded on these concepts by conceiving the Jellicle Ball as an annual ritual in which the cats vie to be chosen to ascend to the Heaviside Layer, thus giving the characters a reason to gather and sing about themselves in the musical. He also added the element of rebirth as a play on the idea that cats have nine lives. One of Nunn's stipulations for agreeing to direct Practical Cats was that actress Judi Dench would be cast in the musical. Lloyd Webber was happy to oblige given her credentials and so Dench joined the company in the dual roles of Grizabella and Jennyanydots. Former Royal Ballet principal dancer Wayne Sleep was offered the part of Mr. Mistoffelees after Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh attended a performance by his dance troupe, one of the many dance showcases they saw in preparation for the musical. Casting for the other roles began in November 1980, with auditions held across the UK for dancers who could also sing and act. There was an initial disagreement over the casting of Nicholas as Rum Tum Tugger; Nunn had misgivings about the actor's easy-going attitude but eventually yielded to Lloyd Webber, Mackintosh and Lynne, all of whom were keen on Nicholas for the role. Sarah Brightman, who had already made a name for herself with the chart hit \"I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper\", arranged a private audition and was cast in an as-then undecided role. By December, the full cast had been assembled. Meanwhile, Mackintosh engaged the advertising agency Dewynters to design a poster for the musical. After much back-and-forth, the agency presented a minimalist poster consisting of a pair of yellow feline eyes set against a black backdrop. The producers and the creative team loved the design but felt that the title\u00a0\u2014 Practical Cats\u00a0\u2014 looked out of place when paired with the image of the cat's eyes. The musical's title was thus shortened to just Cats. The musical was scheduled to open on 30 April 1981, with previews starting on 22 April. Shortly before tickets went on sale in mid-February, Nunn revealed to the alarmed producers that he was struggling to write the script for the musical. Despite still having no established book or score, rehearsals began on 9 March 1981 in a church hall in Chiswick, London.  The situation improved later that day when Lloyd Webber, Mackintosh and Nunn met with Richard Stilgoe, a musician known for his ability to improvise lyrics on the spot, in hopes that Stilgoe could write an opening song for the musical. By the next evening, Stilgoe had produced a draft for \"Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats\". However, \"Memory\", an 11 o'clock number for Grizabella that Nunn insisted the show needed as its \"emotional centre\", still had no lyrics at this point. Lloyd Webber's former writing partner Tim Rice was brought in to write a lyric for the song, but his version was rejected by Nunn for being too depressing. The lyrics for \"Memory\" were not completed by Nunn until well into the previews. Many of the ensemble characters were created by the original cast through extensive improvisation sessions held during the rehearsal process. Said Nunn: \"[O]n day one of rehearsals what we had was 15 poems set to music and five weeks later we had a show with characters, relationships and stories running from beginning to end.\" The production faced a last minute mishap when Dench snapped her Achilles tendon during rehearsals for \"The Old Gumbie Cat\" and had to pull out one week before the first preview. Shortly after this, the original music director, Chris Walker, also had to leave the production for medical reasons and was replaced by the film conductor Harry Rabinowitz. Dench's understudy Myra Sands replaced her as Jennyanydots, while Elaine Paige agreed to take over the role of Grizabella. Opening night was pushed back to 11 May, but Mackintosh refused to postpone the previews as he wanted to dispel the industry rumours that the production was an impending debacle. The development of Cats was also plagued by financial troubles. Mackintosh struggled to raise the \u00a3450,000 needed to stage the musical in the West End as major investors were sceptical of the show's premise and refused to back it. Lloyd Webber personally underwrote the musical and took out a second mortgage on his house for the down payment of the theatre. He later recalled that if Cats had been a commercial failure, it would have left him in financial ruin. The remaining capital was eventually raised by small investments procured from 220 individuals through newspaper advertisements. After the musical became a massive hit, the rate of return for these investors was estimated to have exceeded 3,500 per cent.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A key scene in Blue Velvet was intended to feature This Mortal Coil's version of \"Song to the Siren\" by Tim Buckley, but when the rights to the song proved prohibitively expensive, it was suggested that Badalamenti compose a pop song in the same style, with lyrics written by Lynch. Because the song required a vocalist with a haunting, ethereal voice, Badalamenti recommended Cruise, who had sung in a New York theater workshop Badalamenti had produced. The result of their initial collaboration was \"Mysteries of Love\", which figures prominently in Blue Velvet'''s closing scenes and gained a cult following. Badalamenti and Lynch went on to write and produce additional songs for Cruise, most of which were featured in her debut album, Floating into the Night . The album was released on 12 September 1989 by Warner Bros. Records, and charted on Billboard the following year. It also provided musical material for Lynch's Industrial Symphony No. 1, in which Cruise performed while \"floating\" from a harness dozens of feet above a stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The second, more significant project was the soundtrack to Lynch's Twin Peaks, for which Badalamenti composed the original score. The song \"Falling\", which became the orchestral theme for the television series, caused a minor sensation, winning a Grammy at the 33rd Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental. The Twin Peaks soundtrack, featuring Cruise on the songs \"Into the Night\" and \"The Nightingale\" as well as on the vocal version of \"Falling\", eventually went gold in the US, a rare feat for a television soundtrack. Cruise made a number of appearances on Twin Peaks as a singer at a local bar, and was prominently featured in both the show's landmark pilot episode and the episode where Laura Palmer's murderer is revealed, as well as in 1992's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\", the second single from Floating into the Night, was released in 1990 and was also featured in an episode of Twin Peaks along with \"The World Spins\"; in the episode, several of the main female characters are shown lip-synching to \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart.\" Cruise reinterpreted and sang the theme song for an episode of the USA Network show Psych. The episode, \"Dual Spires\", was about a secluded town full of secrets and skeletons while they investigate the murder of a girl. It aired 20 years to the day after Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed. Cruise appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 12, 1990, filling in along with Spanic Boys on short notice when scheduled performer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor refused to appear on the same show as guest host Andrew Dice Clay. Cruise performed \"Falling.\" The following year, Cruise recorded a Lynch- and Badalamenti-produced cover of the Elvis Presley song \"Summer Kisses, Winter Tears\" for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders's Until the End of the World. Afterward, Cruise maintained a relatively low profile until her second album, The Voice of Love, was released in 1993. An instrumental version of \"She Would Die for Love\" was used as the main theme for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\"She Would Die for Love\" was also covered by alternative metal band Fant\u00f4mas on their The Director's Cut album as \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\". Cruise's early collaborations with Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch were closely related to Lynch's film work, and their lyrics often reflect this. For example, \"Into the Night\" begins with the whispered words \"Now it's dark\", a line which was repeatedly spoken by Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper's character, in Blue Velvet. Lynch also photographed Cruise for the liner notes of Floating Into the Night and The Voice of Love, and created the sculptures featured on the covers of both albums.

{"id": "639_782", "question": "Who was the composer of Patience?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_40712", "text": "The opera is a satire on the aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England, part of the 19th-century European movement that emphasised aesthetic values over moral or social themes in literature, fine art, the decorative arts, and interior design. Called \"Art for Art's Sake\", the movement valued its ideals of beauty above any pragmatic concerns. Although the output of poets, painters and designers was prolific, some argued that the movement's art, poetry and fashion was empty and self-indulgent. That the movement was so popular and also so easy to ridicule as a meaningless fad helped make Patience a big hit. The same factors made a hit out of The Colonel, a play by F. C. Burnand based partly on the satiric cartoons of George du Maurier in Punch magazine. The Colonel beat Patience to the stage by several weeks, but Patience outran Burnand's play. According to Burnand's 1904 memoir, Sullivan's friend the composer Frederic Clay leaked to Burnand the information that Gilbert and Sullivan were working on an \"\u00e6sthetic subject\", and so Burnand raced to produce The Colonel before Patience opened. Modern productions of Patience have sometimes updated the setting of the opera to an analogous era such as the hippie 1960s, making a flower-child poet the rival of a beat poet. The two poets in the opera are given to reciting their own verses aloud, principally to the admiring chorus of rapturous maidens. The style of poetry Bunthorne declaims strongly contrasts with Grosvenor's. The former's, emphatic and obscure, bears a marked resemblance to Swinburne's poetry in its structure, style and heavy use of alliteration. The latter's \"idyllic\" poetry, simpler and pastoral, echoes elements of Coventry Patmore and William Morris. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, \"Bunthorne was the creature of Gilbert's brain, not just a caricature of particular Aesthetes, but an original character in his own right.\" The makeup and costume adopted by the first Bunthorne, George Grossmith, used Swinburne's velvet jacket, the painter James McNeill Whistler's hairstyle and monocle, and knee-breeches like those worn by Oscar Wilde and others. According to Gilbert's biographer Edith Browne, the title character, Patience, was made up and costumed to resemble the subject of a Luke Fildes painting. Patience was not the first satire of the aesthetic movement played by Richard D'Oyly Carte's company at the Opera Comique. Grossmith himself had written a sketch in 1876 called Cups and Saucers that was revived as a companion piece to H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, which was a satire of the blue pottery craze. A popular misconception holds that the central character of Bunthorne, a \"Fleshly Poet,\" was intended to satirise Oscar Wilde, but this identification is retrospective. According to some authorities, Bunthorne is inspired partly by the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who were considerably more famous than Wilde in early 1881 before Wilde published his first volume of poetry. Rossetti had been attacked for immorality by Robert Buchanan in an article called \"The Fleshly School of Poetry\", published in The Contemporary Review for October 1871, a decade before Patience. Nonetheless, Wilde's biographer Richard Ellmann suggests that Wilde is a partial model for both Bunthorne and his rival Grosvenor. Carte, the producer of Patience, was also Wilde's booking manager in 1881 as the poet's popularity took off. In 1882, after the New York production of Patience opened, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sent Wilde on a US lecture tour, with his green carnation and knee-breeches, to explain the English aesthetic movement, intending to help popularise the show's American touring productions. Although a satire of the aesthetic movement is dated today, fads and hero-worship are evergreen, and \"Gilbert\u2019s pen was rarely sharper than when he invented Reginald Bunthorne\". Gilbert originally conceived Patience as a tale of rivalry between two curates and of the doting ladies who attended upon them. The plot and even some of the dialogue were lifted straight out of Gilbert's Bab Ballad \"The Rival Curates.\" While writing the libretto, however, Gilbert took note of the criticism he had received for his very mild satire of a clergyman in The Sorcerer, and looked about for an alternative pair of rivals. Some remnants of the Bab Ballad version do survive in the final text of Patience. Lady Jane advises Bunthorne to tell Grosvenor: \"Your style is much too sanctified \u2013 your cut is too canonical!\"  Later, Grosvenor agrees to change his lifestyle by saying, \"I do it on compulsion!\" \u2013 the very words used by the Reverend Hopley Porter in the Bab Ballad.  Gilbert's selection of aesthetic poet rivals proved to be a fertile subject for topsy-turvy treatment.  He both mocks and joins in Buchanan's criticism of what the latter calls the poetic \"affectations\" of the \"fleshly school\" \u2013 their use of archaic terminology, archaic rhymes, the refrain, and especially their \"habit of accenting the last syllable in words which in ordinary speech are accented on the penultimate.\"  All of these poetic devices or \"mediaevalism's affectations\", as Bunthorne calls them, are parodied in Patience.  For example, accenting the last syllable of \"lily\" and rhyming it with \"die\" parodies two of these devices at once. On 10 October 1881, during its original run, Patience transferred to the new Savoy Theatre, the first public building in the world lit entirely by electric light. Carte explained why he had introduced electric light: \"The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres.  As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat.\" When the electrical system was ready for full operation, in December 1881, Carte stepped on stage to demonstrate the safety of the new technology by breaking a glowing lightbulb before the audience.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After making the film, Rosson resumed his retirement permanently. El Dorado was shot at Old Tucson Studios just west of Tucson, Arizona as well as in and around Kanab, Utah from October 1965 to January 1966.

El Dorado finally reached the theatres in June 1967, a month after The War Wagon had opened. The film was the only screen pairing between Wayne and Mitchum; though they both appear in The Longest Day, they share no scenes in that film. El Dorado is the second of three films directed by Hawks about a sheriff defending his office against belligerent outlaw elements, coming after Rio Bravo and before Rio Lobo , both also starring Wayne in similar roles. The poem repeated in the film and paraphrased in the theme song is \"Eldorado,\" a ballad poem by Edgar Allan Poe. The paintings in the credits are those of artist Olaf Wieghorst, who makes a brief appearance as Swede Larsen in the film. The musical score was composed by Nelson Riddle. Footage from El Dorado was later incorporated into the opening montage of Wayne's final film, The Shootist, to illustrate the backstory of Wayne's character.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With the help of Charlie Clouser, who had composed the score for the film, and a few stand-in actors, Whannell and Wan shot the film with relatively no budget. Whannell had decided to star in the film as well. During filming, it was said that the trap used on Whannell was revealed to be fully functional and very rusted, making it very dangerous. The version of the trap used in the full film was made safer and had artificial rust. Wan later revealed that the film was shot in just over eight days.

Lions Gate immediately accepted the deal and got approved for a  budget to make their script into a full feature film. Instead of being paid in advance, Wan and Whannell agreed to take a percentage of the profits from the film's release, which turned out to be much more than initially expected.

{"id": "639_793", "question": "Who was the composer of Patience?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_40712", "text": "The opera is a satire on the aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England, part of the 19th-century European movement that emphasised aesthetic values over moral or social themes in literature, fine art, the decorative arts, and interior design. Called \"Art for Art's Sake\", the movement valued its ideals of beauty above any pragmatic concerns. Although the output of poets, painters and designers was prolific, some argued that the movement's art, poetry and fashion was empty and self-indulgent. That the movement was so popular and also so easy to ridicule as a meaningless fad helped make Patience a big hit. The same factors made a hit out of The Colonel, a play by F. C. Burnand based partly on the satiric cartoons of George du Maurier in Punch magazine. The Colonel beat Patience to the stage by several weeks, but Patience outran Burnand's play. According to Burnand's 1904 memoir, Sullivan's friend the composer Frederic Clay leaked to Burnand the information that Gilbert and Sullivan were working on an \"\u00e6sthetic subject\", and so Burnand raced to produce The Colonel before Patience opened. Modern productions of Patience have sometimes updated the setting of the opera to an analogous era such as the hippie 1960s, making a flower-child poet the rival of a beat poet. The two poets in the opera are given to reciting their own verses aloud, principally to the admiring chorus of rapturous maidens. The style of poetry Bunthorne declaims strongly contrasts with Grosvenor's. The former's, emphatic and obscure, bears a marked resemblance to Swinburne's poetry in its structure, style and heavy use of alliteration. The latter's \"idyllic\" poetry, simpler and pastoral, echoes elements of Coventry Patmore and William Morris. Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, \"Bunthorne was the creature of Gilbert's brain, not just a caricature of particular Aesthetes, but an original character in his own right.\" The makeup and costume adopted by the first Bunthorne, George Grossmith, used Swinburne's velvet jacket, the painter James McNeill Whistler's hairstyle and monocle, and knee-breeches like those worn by Oscar Wilde and others. According to Gilbert's biographer Edith Browne, the title character, Patience, was made up and costumed to resemble the subject of a Luke Fildes painting. Patience was not the first satire of the aesthetic movement played by Richard D'Oyly Carte's company at the Opera Comique. Grossmith himself had written a sketch in 1876 called Cups and Saucers that was revived as a companion piece to H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, which was a satire of the blue pottery craze. A popular misconception holds that the central character of Bunthorne, a \"Fleshly Poet,\" was intended to satirise Oscar Wilde, but this identification is retrospective. According to some authorities, Bunthorne is inspired partly by the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who were considerably more famous than Wilde in early 1881 before Wilde published his first volume of poetry. Rossetti had been attacked for immorality by Robert Buchanan in an article called \"The Fleshly School of Poetry\", published in The Contemporary Review for October 1871, a decade before Patience. Nonetheless, Wilde's biographer Richard Ellmann suggests that Wilde is a partial model for both Bunthorne and his rival Grosvenor. Carte, the producer of Patience, was also Wilde's booking manager in 1881 as the poet's popularity took off. In 1882, after the New York production of Patience opened, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sent Wilde on a US lecture tour, with his green carnation and knee-breeches, to explain the English aesthetic movement, intending to help popularise the show's American touring productions. Although a satire of the aesthetic movement is dated today, fads and hero-worship are evergreen, and \"Gilbert\u2019s pen was rarely sharper than when he invented Reginald Bunthorne\". Gilbert originally conceived Patience as a tale of rivalry between two curates and of the doting ladies who attended upon them. The plot and even some of the dialogue were lifted straight out of Gilbert's Bab Ballad \"The Rival Curates.\" While writing the libretto, however, Gilbert took note of the criticism he had received for his very mild satire of a clergyman in The Sorcerer, and looked about for an alternative pair of rivals. Some remnants of the Bab Ballad version do survive in the final text of Patience. Lady Jane advises Bunthorne to tell Grosvenor: \"Your style is much too sanctified \u2013 your cut is too canonical!\"  Later, Grosvenor agrees to change his lifestyle by saying, \"I do it on compulsion!\" \u2013 the very words used by the Reverend Hopley Porter in the Bab Ballad.  Gilbert's selection of aesthetic poet rivals proved to be a fertile subject for topsy-turvy treatment.  He both mocks and joins in Buchanan's criticism of what the latter calls the poetic \"affectations\" of the \"fleshly school\" \u2013 their use of archaic terminology, archaic rhymes, the refrain, and especially their \"habit of accenting the last syllable in words which in ordinary speech are accented on the penultimate.\"  All of these poetic devices or \"mediaevalism's affectations\", as Bunthorne calls them, are parodied in Patience.  For example, accenting the last syllable of \"lily\" and rhyming it with \"die\" parodies two of these devices at once. On 10 October 1881, during its original run, Patience transferred to the new Savoy Theatre, the first public building in the world lit entirely by electric light. Carte explained why he had introduced electric light: \"The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres.  As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat.\" When the electrical system was ready for full operation, in December 1881, Carte stepped on stage to demonstrate the safety of the new technology by breaking a glowing lightbulb before the audience.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_797", "question": "Who was the composer of The Creation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "422_52393", "text": "France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord. French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz , Georges Bizet , Gabriel Faur\u00e9 , Charles Gounod , Jacques Offenbach , \u00c9douard Lalo , Jules Massenet and Werther ) and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3). Later came precursors of modern classical music. \u00c9rik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnop\u00e9dies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perp\u00e9tuels , the ballet Les biches , the Concert champ\u00eatre for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites and the Gloria for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Bol\u00e9ro . More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music. French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson fran\u00e7aise, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries, bands such as Noir D\u00e9sir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira, or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Myl\u00e8ne Farmer, Aliz\u00e9e and Nolwenn Leroy, electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s , electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world. Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera , the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organised, the most popular being Eurock\u00e9ennes , Solidays and Rock en Seine.

After the first grueling workout, the women are taken away for a more fun activity: dress shopping! However, the activity is \"bitter-sweet\" for Lindsey and some of the other girls due to their current weights. The men also spend some time looking at outfits for the big day at a tuxedo shop. This shopping trip serves as motivation for many of the contestants. After everyone tries on their dream wedding gowns and tuxedos, they meet up with Sara Rue, the hostess of the show. Sara tells everyone that their first challenge will be a dancing competition and the winners will get their dream outfits. The couples must maintain a combined heart-rate of 225 beats per minute to start in order to stay in the competition, and each song results in a higher heart-rate requirement. Ginny and Marc are the first couple to be eliminated. After a few more minutes of intense dancing, running, and jumping jacks, all the couples were eliminated, leaving Laeresa and Stephen as the winners. The weigh-in ceremony was very similar to the weigh-ins on The Biggest Loser, however, the two couples who had the lowest percentage of weight loss immediately faced off in an elimination challenge called \"Til Death Do Us Part,\" and that their weights were reported as a combined total, not individually.

The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. Soldiers who completed their term of service still needed to train to maintain their skill because they were subject to annual military readiness inspections and could be called up for future service - until this practice was discontinued after 30 AD with the abolishment of much of the conscription system.  The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional standing army was stationed near the capital. During the Eastern Han, conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army , while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army . Led by Colonels , the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops. The latter were known as  \u90e8\u66f2, a special social class in Chinese history. During times of war, the volunteer army was increased, and a much larger militia was raised across the country to supplement the Northern Army. In these circumstances, a General led a division, which was divided into regiments led by Colonels and sometimes Majors . Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains.

{"id": "639_805", "question": "Who was the composer of Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_57122", "text": "Mozart wrote the concerto in April 1778, during his seven-month sojourn in Paris. It was commissioned by Adrien-Louis de Bonni\u00e8res, duc de Gu\u00eenes , a flutist, for his use and for that of his eldest daughter, Marie-Louise-Philippine , a harpist, who was taking composition lessons from the composer, at the duke's home, the H\u00f4tel de Castries. Mozart stated in a letter to his father that he thought the duke played the flute \"extremely well\" and that Marie's playing of the harp was \"magnifique\". As a composition student, however, Mozart found Marie thoroughly inept. The duke , an aristocrat Mozart came to despise, never paid the composer for this work, and Mozart instead was offered only half the expected fee for the lessons, through de Guines' housekeeper. But he refused it. Little is known of the work's early performance history, though it seems probable that father and daughter played it first. In the classical period, the harp was still in development, and was not considered a standard orchestral instrument. It was regarded more as a plucked piano. Therefore, harp and flute was considered an extremely unusual combination. Currently, there is much more repertoire for a flute and harp duo, especially without orchestra. Much of this repertoire was written by composers in the nineteenth century. Mozart's opinion of the harp, however, was perhaps dubious at best, for he never wrote another piece that employed it. Mozart quite likely composed this work with the duke's and his daughter's particular musical abilities in mind. He probably composed the majority of this concerto at the home of Joseph Legros, the director of the Concert Spirituel. Monsieur Legros had given Mozart the use of his keyboard in his home so that he could compose. The piece is essentially in the form of a Sinfonia Concertante, which was extremely popular in Paris at the time. Today, the concerto is often played by chamber ensembles, because it is technically and elegantly challenging for both the solo instruments it calls for. It is also often played by orchestras to display the talents of their own flutists and harpists. The harp part appears to be more like an adaptation of a piano piece than an original harp part; this is especially evident in the patterns of five and ten notes throughout all three movements which would not fall under the fingers as easily for a harpist, as the fifth fingers are typically not used, though they were considered part of early harp technique. There are no full, rich glissandi, and although there is counterpoint in the harp part, it does not typically include lush chords. Mozart did not include any cadenzas of his own, as is normal for his compositions. Alfred Einstein claims that Mozart's cadenzas for this work were lost. A few popular cadenzas are often performed, such as those by Carl Reinecke, but many flutists and harpists have chosen to write their own. Andr\u00e9 Previn has also written cadenzas for this piece.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_808", "question": "Who was the composer of Black or White?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_17827", "text": "Shaft played a crucial part in the development of African-American advancement in Hollywood. In the creation of Shaft, there was a significant African-American presence, with director Parks, editor Hugh A. Robertson, and musical composer Isaac Hayes playing crucial roles. On the other hand, white men controlled the other important aspects of Shaft'''s production. Scenarist and writer Tidyman, writer Black, producer Freeman, and executive producers Silliphant and Lewis were all white men who heavily influenced the making of Shaft. In an analysis of Shaft, Stanly Corkin stated, \"Further, the reception of the idea of blackness also becomes various, defined by any number of subject positions, and again, those cannot be fixed to any particular racially defined place of origin.\" In other words, the perception of race depends on the viewer and thus differs between individuals. Since different representations of race appeal to different people, the film's white creators fabricated its representation of blackness in order to appeal to African American and white audiences alike. MGM was struggling financially during the making of this film, so making a profitable film was a necessity. \"Under the devious guise of providing the Black American with a new and positive image of his/her life, these films confer upon the viewer, Black or White, little more than a pretended glamour and sophistication, the empty, repetitive wasteland of ancient Hollywood traditionalism.\" Parks' decision to cast Roundtree rather than a white actor, for whom the role was written, instantly altered the presentation of race in the film. Critics, however, believed the plot was not altered enough to accommodate the change in racial dynamics. \"Mark Reid, for example, argues that Shaft is a product of the studio imagination and merely a 'black-skinned replica' of the white action hero commonly found in the detective genre.\" One way that Shaft's blackness was showcased was through his attire. Shaft was \"stylistically racialized: [He] wears clothes and affects manners that are associated with being black\". Shaft was known for his elegant garb, as he was frequently draped in leather coats and turtlenecks throughout the film. Although his smooth, classy look evoked a greater interest from viewers, it in no way represented fashion typical of the black community in that era. Further, Shaft relies upon a group of militant black nationalists in helping him complete his mission to save Bumpy's daughter. The inclusion of a group so strongly identified with the Black Power movement was clearly an effort to appeal to black audience members. However, the film presented the black nationalists as a group that failed to further the black cause, raised no awareness of the black struggle, and displayed them simply as a hired team of assailants to assist Shaft on his mission. The filming of Shaft partly in the neighborhood of Harlem also allowed the black viewer to have a deeper connection to this film. The writers portrayed Shaft as a man who clearly had a good relationship with this neighborhood, yet rejected it once he became wealthy, moving to the predominantly white area of Greenwich Village. Traditional black thought in this era was that African Americans who had been prosperous financially should invest in and give back to the communities from which they came. Instead, \"the implication is that the wise black will want to sever ties with the people of Harlem and find a place among whites.\" This point further indicates the false portrayal of race in Shaft, as a true black action hero of his time period would have been more loyal to his neighborhood. The result of this inauthentic portrayal of blackness in early 1970s blaxploitation films like Shaft had an effect on black audiences viewing them. Instead of the collective nature of the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movement in the 1960s, these films helped to usher in a decade of self-indulgence, material gain, and drug consumption. \"Equally important, Riley points out that the narratives about, and images of, blacks in these new films are no more than thematic templates reworked with black casts and updated stereotypes that reconfirm white expectations of blacks and serve to repress and delay the awakening of any real political consciousness.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson .

Although a follower of Wagner's reforms of the operatic genre, which he believed would be its salvation, Smetana rejected accusations of excessive Wagnerism, claiming that he was sufficiently occupied with \"Smetanism, for that is the only honest style!\" The predominantly \"national\" character of the first four operas is tempered by the lyrical romanticism of those written later, particularly the last three, composed in the years of Smetana's deafness. The first of this final trio, The Kiss, written when Smetana was receiving painful medical treatment, is described by Newmarch as a work of serene beauty, in which tears and smiles alternate throughout the score. Smetana's librettist for \"The Kiss\" was the young feminist Eli\u0161ka Kr\u00e1snohorsk\u00e1, who also supplied the texts for his final two operas. She dominated the ailing composer, who had no say in the subject-matter, the voice types or the balance between solos, duets and ensembles. Nevertheless, critics have noted few signs of a decline in Smetana's powers in these works, while his increasing proficiency in Czech meant that his settings of the language are much superior to those of his earlier operas. Smetana's eight operas created the bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only The Bartered Bride is performed regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly became part of the repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that The Bartered Bride, while not a \"gem of the first order\", is nevertheless \"a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind.\" Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says \"lifts us off our feet with its madcap vivacity\", was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: \"The Bartered Bride was merely child's play, written straight off the reel\". In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, Dalibor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be \"either too airy or too sophisticated\". Universal Studios wanted a composer with experience scoring films, ruling out Firefly composer Greg Edmonson. Whedon first thought of Carter Burwell, of whom Whedon was a huge fan. However, Whedon later felt that Burwell was not the right choice because as the film changed, the needs of the score changed as well. Burwell found working on the project difficult as it required he work \"opposite\" to his usual approach. The production would have continued with Burwell, but his other obligations left him little time to compose an entirely new score for Serenity.

David Newman was recommended by Universal's music executives when Whedon requested a composer capable of \"everything\" and \"quickly\". Whedon's instructions to Newman for the ship Serenity theme was something homemade and mournful, evoking the idea of pioneers who had only what they could carry. Whedon wished the theme to let viewers know they were now home. River Tam's theme was played on a uniquely shaped, square, antique piano that was slightly out of tune. The piano reminded Newman of River and composed a \"haunting, haunted, vaguely eastern and achingly unresolved\" theme that Whedon felt proved Newman's understanding of the film's musical needs.

{"id": "639_820", "question": "Who was the composer of Bring It On?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_77754", "text": "Faith's music displays a freely modulating harmonic language within the boundaries of tonality that combines neo-romantic and impressionistic qualities. With Debussy, Ravel, and Rachmaninoff as important influences on his music, and Brahms as a model with respect to form, Faith also shares musical traits with Vaughan Williams, particularly in the areas of modality and harmonic color and with Roger Quilter, the Victorian whose songs displayed a trait known as \"decorous Romanticism.\" Faith's English flavor is even further highlighted by the composer's choice of poetry, much of which comes from English and Irish authors. Having developed a somewhat dry wit and an infectious, silly humor, Faith infrequently reflected these personality traits in his music, leaning more toward a sound that exudes a deep longing and romantic spirit. Faith's song output spans the years 1944 to the present\u2014his entire life as a composer. The over 120 settings run the stylistic gamut from sophisticated concert pieces to simple miniatures, duets, vocalises and selections with obbligato instruments, including flute, cello, viola and harp. His settings are generally for medium voice. Some have been written for specific singers to whom he has dedicated the music. Many of the songs are grouped according to subject matter, but are not necessarily musically connected. They may be sung as sets or separately, and may be transposed to suit the singer. Faith's tempo indications use traditional Italian terminology and the metronome markings are only suggestions. He is a gracious composer who allows individuals to develop their own interpretations of his music. Because Faith himself is a pianist, many of the songs have sophisticated accompaniments. Sometimes the piano doubles the voice, though hardly ever through an entire piece. At other times the piano will play a countermelody to the voice to form a kind of obbligato. Like Debussy, Faith has a fondness for triplets, because of the movement and flow they add to a song. Thomas Nashe's \"Spring, the Sweet Spring\" is an exercise in perpetual motion for the accompanist, with only brief repose at the end of each stanza. This inventive, florid accompaniment, along with Faith's strict use of ABA form, thin texture, and a definite key signature lend a neo-baroque character to this Elizabethan poem. The harmony, however, remains contemporary, with Faith's use of incidental chromatics and added-note chords. Like many composers who rely on modality rather than tonality, Faith rarely uses key signatures. His harmonic idiom displays a changing palette of colors marked by simultaneous cross-relations, the Lydian sharped fourth, and combinations of this sharped fourth and Mixolydian flatted seventh. Faith has denied any desire to pursue more avant-garde idioms. Earlier experiments in progressive styles met with little success, and if anything beyond the romantic exists in Faith's music, it may be the influence of Hindemith which was furthered by his studies at Indiana University with Bernhard Heiden, himself a Hindemith pupil. Traces of this influence can be discerned in the appearance of quartal/quintal harmony in many of the songs. This is seen in \"The Blackbird\" by the Victorian author William Ernest Henley composed in 1955. The accompaniment begins with broken ninth and tenth intervals supported by mildly dissonant chords; it is then followed by a hocket-like passage. This underlying texture continues through the first half of the song, contrasting with legato vocal melody. Faith's use of arch form or \"coming full circle\" reflects the influence of Brahms, whose many songs fall into this structural category. He may end with a literal repeat, a transposed portion, or only a fragment of A, and may repeat text, music, or both in the process. Arch form is also reflected in the use of dynamics. Many songs begin quietly, reach a climax in an interior section, and then end as they began. The composer's selection of poetry brings to the foreground some of literature's most famous writers in works that in this day and age have been unjustly neglected by the general public: Conrad Aiken, Edward Lear, Charles Cotton, and Christina Rossetti, to name a few. In his later years Faith began to set more diverse poets, including Moorish, Islamic and Chinese authors. That Faith is well-read is apparent not only in his choice of fine poetry to set to music, but also in his allusions to literature in many of his instrumental works. In addition, he often selects longer poems than would be considered usual for a song and writes few miniatures. The success of setting a lengthy piece of verse seems to depend upon Faith's ability to delay the listener's climactic expectations by moving through harmonic ambiguity until reaching an emotionally charged section that merits a cadence\u2014usually on open sonorities without the thirds. This event may repeat itself many times with a greater or lesser dynamic level, thereby expanding his music resources. Faith's songs adhere strictly to the rhythm dictated by the text of the poem. In fact, he simultaneously composes both melody and accompaniment by singing the text and playing the keyboard and immediately writing it down. Faith's adherence to the text rhythm results in shifting meters to accommodate phrases of varying length and text-derived rhythmic figures often provide the basis for his accompaniments For subject matter Faith prefers nature imagery over love poetry and until 1994 with his Mother Goose Rhymes, there had been only one comical song\u2014Edward Lear's \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" written in 1960. Many of Faith's settings reflect the nationality of the poet and the time period in which the poem was written. For example, Four Love Songs on Elizabethan lyrics display thin textures, balanced forms, and traditional harmonic progressions, while the Jean de La Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont songs have a French character that reveals Faith's debt to Ravel and Debussy. More recently, Faith's songs on Moorish poetry evoke an exotic, middle eastern quality. In the beautiful setting of Ben Jonson's \"To Celia\" , Faith, by stressing the poem's inherent passion, brings a fresh outlook to a lyric which had become too familiar in arrangements of the old English setting. He achieves this through an operatically conceived vocal line: high and sustained, and encompassing a range of an octave and a fifth. Two works that do not necessarily fall into specific stylistic categories, but deserve mention nonetheless, are Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Music When Soft Voices Die\" and the miniature \"Remember Me\" by the Victorian Christina Rossetti. The spontaneous quality of the Shelley song reveals the poem's great effect on Faith, who, after nearly two years without song writing , produced one of his most frequently performed pieces. The introduction's angular, twisting melody, taken later by the vocal line, lends a troubled, unsettling quality to the lyric. \"Remember Me\" was written in 1954 and is unusual for its brevity. The poet, Christina Rossetti, was an Englishwoman of Italian descent and is best known for her words to the hymns \"In the Bleak Mid-Winter\" and \"Love Came Down at Christmas.\" Faith set three more of her poems which are included in the first published volume of songs by Leyerle Publications. Many of Faith's songs have themes related to the sea, and there are a number of others in which the sea figures as an integral element in the poem. This stems from the composer\"s extreme fascination with water, having been raised near the high banks of the wide Ohio River in Evansville, Indiana. \"Sea Fever\" , one of Faith's few biographically-influenced songs, displays such a depth of emotion rare for a nineteen-year-old. It is an important early song because it established many compositional techniques to which the composer returned throughout his lyrical output. Another \"sea\" example is \"Ships\" an English translation of \"Vaisseaux, nous vous aurons aim\u00e9s\" by Jean de la Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont, the  French World War I poet killed in action in 1914. This poem was also set by Faur\u00e9 in that composer's final song cycle L'horizon chim\u00e9rique. Faith's song is scored for cello obbligato, piano, and female voice. Faith skillfully translates into music the emotions behind the words of the world's greatest authors. Although many of his songs display common characteristics, each reveals an approach that allows the poem's individuality to shine through. Performers of art song, both singers and pianists, will appreciate Faith's output, considering the variety of poems he set to music and the gracious way he treats the voice and piano in his neo-romantic/impressionistic manner. Somewhat reticent of theoretical discussions, however, Faith considers himself only to be a composer of the heart, who relies on his musical gifts to bring joy to others.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_821", "question": "Who was the composer of The Planets?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_15116", "text": "The Planets was composed over nearly three years, between 1914 and 1917. The work had its origins in March and April 1913, when Gustav Holst and his friend and benefactor Balfour Gardiner holidayed in Spain with the composer Arnold Bax and his brother, the author Clifford Bax. A discussion about astrology piqued Holst's interest in the subject. Clifford Bax later commented that Holst became \"a remarkably skilled interpreter of horoscopes\". Shortly after the holiday Holst wrote to a friend: \"I only study things that suggest music to me. That's why I worried at Sanskrit. Then recently the character of each planet suggested lots to me, and I have been studying astrology fairly closely\". He told Clifford Bax in 1926 that The Planets: Imogen Holst, the composer's daughter, wrote that her father had difficulty with large-scale orchestral structures such as symphonies, and the idea of a suite with a separate character for each movement was an inspiration to him. Holst's biographer Michael Short and the musicologist Richard Greene both think it likely that another inspiration for the composer to write a suite for large orchestra was the example of Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra. That suite had been performed in London in 1912 and again in 1914; Holst was at one of the performances, and he is known to have owned a copy of the score. Holst described The Planets as \"a series of mood pictures\", acting as \"foils to one another\", with \"very little contrast in any one of them\". Short writes that some of the characteristics the composer attributed to the planets may have been suggested by Alan Leo's booklet What is a Horoscope?, which he was reading at the time. Holst took the title of two movements \u2013 \"Mercury, the Winged Messenger\" and \"Neptune, the Mystic\" \u2013 from Leo's books. But although astrology was Holst's starting point, he arranged the planets to suit his own plan: In an early sketch for the suite Holst listed Mercury as \"no. 1\", which Greene suggests raises the possibility that the composer's first idea was simply to depict the planets in the obvious order, from nearest the sun to the farthest. \"However, opening with the more disturbing character of Mars allows a more dramatic and compelling working out of the musical material\". Holst had a heavy workload as head of music at St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith and director of music at Morley College, and had limited time for composing. Imogen Holst wrote, \"Weekends and holidays were the only times when he could really get on with his own work, which is why it took him over two years to finish The Planets\". She added that Holst's chronic neuritis in his right arm was troubling him considerably and he would have found it impossible to complete the 198 pages of the large full score without the help of two colleagues at St Paul's, Vally Lasker and Nora Day, whom he called his \"scribes\". The first movement to be written was Mars in mid-1914, followed by Venus and Jupiter in the latter part of the year, Saturn and Uranus in mid-1915, Neptune later in 1915 and Mercury in early 1916. Holst completed the orchestration during 1917.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_822", "question": "Who was the composer of Arthur?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_5835", "text": "King Arthur was a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of Welsh and English folklore and literary invention, and modern historians generally agree that he is unhistorical. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin. Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae . In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown. Although the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version, Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire. Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the magician Merlin, Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed, until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend continues to have prominence, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His opportunities to set English texts to music had been more limited. He had spent the years 1717 to 1719 as composer in residence to the wealthy Duke of Chandos, where he had written church anthems and two stage works, Acis and Galatea and Esther. He had composed vocal music to English words for various royal occasions, including a set of Coronation anthems for George II in 1727, which had made a huge impact. In 1731, a performance of the 1718 version of Esther, a work in English based on a Biblical drama by Jean Racine, was given in London without Handel's participation and had proved popular. He thus revised the work and planned to present it at the theatre where his Italian operas were being presented. However, the Bishop of London would not permit a drama based on a Biblical story to be acted out on the stage; Handel therefore presented Esther in concert form, thus giving birth to the English oratorio. Esther in its revised form proved a popular work, and Handel, though still continuing to focus on composition of Italian operas, followed it with two more sacred dramas with English words to be presented in concert form, Deborah, and Athalia , both in 1733. Such was the success of his oratorios in English that eventually Handel abandoned Italian opera, his last being Deidamia in 1741, and produced a string of masterpieces of oratorio in English. Handel began the composition of Samson immediately after completing Messiah on 14 September 1741. It uses a libretto by Newburgh Hamilton, who based it on Milton's Samson Agonistes, which in turn was based on the figure Samson in Chapter 16 of the Book of Judges. Handel completed the first act on 20 September 1741, the second act on 11 October that year, and the whole work on 29 October. Shortly after that he travelled to Dublin to put on the premiere of Messiah, returning to London at the end of August 1742 and thoroughly revising Samson. The premiere was given at Covent Garden in London on 18 February 1743, with the incidental organ music probably the recently completed concerto in A major  .  The oratorio was a great success, leading to a total of seven performances in its first season, the most in a single season of any of his oratorios.

Several state holidays, such as Independence Day and Victory Day, draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk. The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country. Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of Cyril of Turaw. By the 16th century, Polotsk resident Francysk Skaryna translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in Prague and Vilnius sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as U\u0142adzimir \u017dy\u0142ka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, \u0179mitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in Vilnius but now is published in Minsk. After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of \"Belarusianization\" was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges. The free development of literature occurred only in Polish-held territory until Soviet occupation in 1939. Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s. The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by Vasil Byka\u016d and Uladzimir Karatkievich. An influential author who devoted his work to awakening the awareness of the catastrophes the country has suffered, was Ales Adamovich. He was named by Svetlana Alexievich, the Belarusian winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature 2015, as \"her main teacher, who helped her to find a path of her own\". Music in Belarus largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the 19th century, Polish composer Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich and created the opera Sialanka . At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet Nightingale by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk. After the Second World War, music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland. During this period, Anatoly Bogatyrev, creator of the opera In Polesye Virgin Forest, served as the \"tutor\" of Belarusian composers. The National Academic Theatre of Ballet in Minsk was awarded the Benois de la Dance Prize in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world. Rock music has become increasingly popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio in favor of traditional Belarusian music. Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the Eurovision Song Contest.National State Teleradiocompany Marc Chagall was born in Liozna in 1887.

Abhinay is the youthful son of another affluent land-owning family belonging to the same village. His parents are dead, and he is heir to his grandfather , who owns extensive farmlands and property. Abhinav is not keen on the life of a land-owner. He has grown up in the city, and wants to start a music troupe, playing the western pop music which is entirely alien to this society. It is the death anniversary of Abhinav's parents, and his grandfather performs the usual Hindu ceremonies on the riverbank, like every year. This time, after many years, Abhinav is with him. As they arrive at the riverbank, a lady who has just finished performing the same rituals is leaving. This is Swarnalatha, and when she sees a young boy with Nasser, she looks intensely at the young man. Abhinav is intrigued by her look, and after some hesitation, he leaves his grandfather and follows the lady through the village streets. A car suddenly appears and almost crashes into a distracted and careless Abhinav, but swerves away in the nick of time and hits some bushes. This incident causes great and visible trauma to Swarnalatha, who now runs homeward. Abhinav, who has fallen on his face, is unable to follow her further. He meets the driver of the car, the beautiful and strikingly modern city girl Pinky , dressed in the skimpiest clothes ever seen in an Indian village. The car having broken down, Pinky has nowhere to stay the village; Abhinav takes her home, where his grandfather invites her to stay a few days while her car is repaired. Swarnalatha is a classically trained Carnatic singer who lost her son and best friend, Vaishnavi in a bus accident. The story reopens after a period of 20 years, when Vaishnavi's son, plans to leave his business of composing jingles with a desire to start a music troupe to compose an everlasting music just like the Charminar, and with these plans returns to his home in his village. His plan irks his father Nassar who wants him to look after the ancestral lands in the village. On the day of Death Anniversary of Vaishnavi, Abhinay spots Swarnalatha, and hears her song \"Pibare Ramarasam\" in the temple. When Swarnalatha leaves the temple, Abhinay stops her, saying, \"you knew my mother\" and follows her. The duo reach the bridge when a car comes and hits Abhinay, and the car was being driven by Pinky . Swarnalatha screams and reaches her home, with the 20 years old guilt in her mind that her one step on the bridge caused the accident. Here, the Car gets some glitch and Pinky is compelled to stay for the night in the village. Next morning both Abhinay and Pinky set for Hyderabad to seek the perfect artists for the proposed troop, and they get a guitarist and a drummer Balaji Shaleen Sharma. All land up at Pinky's boutique whose environment irritates Abhinay but somehow Pinky consoles him and the practices start, with a few opportunities coming up their way, but their rock-band does not receive the respect as Abhinay had expected. After a few days Abhinay receives the violin his mother used to play when she was alive. He returns to the village to return the violin to Swarnalatha, saying that both her voice and the sound of the violin are complementary to each other and one cannot exist without one another, and invites her to sing with their troop, for which she refuses saying that she won't come to the village and returns the violin. Swarnalatha's husband asks him to bring his troop to the house on Ganesh Chaturthi day. The troop arrives on the said date and Swarnalatha starts singing \"Mahaganapathi Manasa Smarami\", but stops in between and sings the sophisticated sargam of the song, for which no compatible music could be played. That evening Abhinay again compels Swarnalatha to sing in the city, but she again refuses, and Abhinay ends the communication with the note that She owes him a lot as he is her best friend's son, after all. Next morning Abhinay's father expresses his dislike in his son's musical career in front of Swarnalatha, and at the same time Swarnalatha agrees to sing for Abhinay in the city. She starts from her house with her husband. On the way their car breaks down and they are forced to take the bus, which crosses the bridge. Swarnalatha starts screaming, stops the bus and starts running and falls ill. Both return to home and her husband reports that she cannot come for singing. Next day Swarnalatha personally calls pinky and asks her to learn Carnatic Music. Pinky learns carnatic music from Swarnalatha. After a few days Abhinay plans a concert, though for Pinky to sing but always urges Swarnalatha to come for singing, but she continues to express her reluctance because she considers the bridge as a punishment for her ambitions. One day, while driving, Pinky gets irked at the repetitive reluctance of Swarnalatha, and speeds up the car and crosses the bridge, and Swarna starts screaming, \"Stop the car! We all are going to die\". Finally Pinky stops the car and reveals that her father was drunk and was responsible for the accident. The film ends with the concert in which Swarnalatha appears and sings \"Thaaye Yashoda\" on repeated urging from Pinky, and the concert becomes a 10-week hit. A side plot involving Pinky and her city slicker mother and the villager Appa Raowith his buffalo Annapoorna add comedy into an otherwise serious and thoughtful film. The film was photographed by Rajiv Menon and edited by A. Sreekar Prasad. Music was composed by Mani Sharma.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The orchestra was conducted by James Shearman. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as bagpipes, a solo fiddle, Celtic harps, flutes and the bodhr\u00e1n, with an electronically treated dulcimer and cimbalom to give it a more contemporary feel. \"I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as reels, jigs, and strathspeys, which not only serve the action but keep it authentic,\" said Doyle. As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying \"unaccompanied Gaelic psalm singing.\" Doyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled \"A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan \" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language. The drinking song \"Song of Mor'du\" sung by Billy Connolly, Scott Davies, Patrick Doyle, Gordon Neville, Alex Norton and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in Scots, which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. In addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; \"Learn Me Right\" written by Mumford & Sons and performed with Birdy, \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" . Both \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" were performed by Julie Fowlis, as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer. Along with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.

This was also the year of his first musical publication, the six Trio Sonatas, Opus 1. These were titled Sonate sei da chiesa e da camera; Leopold did the work of copper engraving himself. He continued to compose, producing a series of German Passion cantatas. In 1747 he married Anna Maria Pertl, who bore him seven children, although only two of them survived past infancy: Johann Leopold Joachim Maria Anna Cordula Maria Anna Nepomucena Walpurgis Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia, Nannerl Johann Karl Amadeus Maria Crescentia Francisca de Paula Johann Chrysostomus Wolfgang Theophilus In 1743 Leopold Mozart was appointed to a position in the musical establishment of Count Leopold Anton von Firmian, the ruling Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. His duties included composition and the teaching of violin to the choirboys of the Salzburg cathedral. He was promoted to second violinist in 1758 and in 1763 to deputy Kapellmeister. He rose no further; others were repeatedly promoted over him to the head position of Kapellmeister. The question of whether Leopold was successful as a composer is debated. The Grove Dictionary says that as of 1756, \"Mozart was already well-known. His works circulated widely in German-speaking Europe.\" However, biographer Maynard Solomon asserts that he \"failed to make his mark as a composer\", and Alfred Einstein \"judged him to be an undistinguished composer\". Scholars agree, however, that Leopold was successful as a pedagogue. In 1755, he wrote his Versuch einer gr\u00fcndlichen Violinschule, a comprehensive treatise on violin playing. This work was published in 1756 , and went through two further German editions , as well as being translated into Dutch and French .

L\u00e9lio is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and \"returning to life\" via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and L\u00e9lio were about Harriet Smithson . The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of L\u00e9lio describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can't put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully.

From the 18th century, composers including Jose Joaquim Lobo de Mesquita, Francisco Gomes da Rocha, Marcos Coelho Neto and Manoel de Oliveira Dias reinforced the musical tradition of Minas with the composition of baroque pieces that are now revered as masterpieces. For classical music, the state features productions and performances of various orchestras and choirs. Among them there are the Symphonic Orchestra of Minas Gerais and the Coral L\u00edrico de Minas Gerais, a State Choir, maintained by Clovis Salgado Foundation, an institution linked to the Secretary of State for Culture. These and other groups have a strong presence in the capital and throughout the state, working for the popularization and democratization of classical music. One of the most prolific contemporary composers was born in Minas Gerais, Prof. Dr. Andersen Viana, which music has been recognized most frequently abroad. The most varied rhythms and sounds have their origins in the state. Ary Barroso, who in 1939 composed one of Brazil's best known songs throughout the world, Aquarela do Brasil, was born in Ub\u00e1, in the Zona da Mata Mineira. In the 1960s and 70s streets in the traditional neighborhood of Santa Tereza, Belo Horizonte, were the scene of one of the most important movements of national music: Clube da Esquina. With a unique blend of Brazilian popular music with pop and jazz, the club was met with talents like Milton Nascimento, Wagner Tiso, Toninho Horta, Fernando Brant, L\u00f4 Borges, Beto Guedes, and Fl\u00e1vio Venturini. In the 1980s and 90s a scene of heavy metal bands has been held in Belo Horizonte.

A 1966 letter from Gloag to Clayton suggests that 20th Century Fox was interested in producing a film adaptation and that Eleanor Perry had written a script, but it was acquired for Clayton by MGM and Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff. Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\". Richard Burton was the first choice to play Charlie, but it was thought that his fee would push the budget too high, so Bogarde was cast in the role. The juvenile cast was led by Pamela Franklin, who had worked with Clayton in The Innocents. Yootha Joyce had worked with Clayton in an acclaimed cameo role in Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . Our Mother's House is the second in a loose trilogy of films in which Clayton explored themes of the occult and of children in isolated situations who are threatened by evil. He most famously essayed these subjects in The Innocents, his acclaimed adaptation of Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\", and he returned to it in the 1980s with his screen adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes . In his 1975 memoir, Dirk Bogarde recounted his experience with the production in glowing terms: \"On my first morning in the gloomy house in Croydon I was in a bit of a funk.

It takes place in a fictional version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate, and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles. The game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface. The early releases of the game came with copy protection. A cardboard wheel, named \"Dial-a-Pirate\", was provided, and the player had to match the pirate shown on-screen with that of the wheel. Critics praised The Secret of Monkey Island for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. Several publications list it among the greatest video games of all time. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the Monkey Island series. Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman also led the development of the sequel Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. LucasArts released a remake of the original in 2009, which was also well received by the gaming press.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The singer intended the album to be a source of empowerment for young people; she wished she had written some of the songs before she attended high school. The album's sound was inspired by Trainor's love for throwback style records, and the music of the 1950s and 1960s eras in music. She created the album's sound by combining different musical genres, including: Caribbean, doo-wop, hip hop, soca and pop. The record was influenced by the American group Fugees. Trainor composed \"All About That Bass\" when she was an independent recording artist. She \"shopped\" the song around at various record labels and offered it to numerous artists, including Beyonc\u00e9, all of whom rejected it. Trainor, however, was signed to Epic Records by chairman L.A. Reid after she performed the song for him in February 2014. Reid suggested the song's demo should remain as the final version after additional audio mastering. \"All About That Bass\" was inspired by Bruno Mars' \"Just the Way You Are\" and The Chordettes' \"Lollipop\" . When Times Nolan Feeney asked Trainor what she wanted listeners to hear on Title, Trainor said, \"I want to help myself. I want to make sure guys take me on a date and treat me right because I didn't do that in the past. I want to love my body more. I just hope younger girls love themselves more, and younger people in general\u00a0...\" \"Dear Future Husband\" was inspired by Trainor's love of harmonies and a joke she made with her father, in which she said her future husband \"is out there somewhere, chilling\". With the track, Trainor wanted to convey that women should be treated better by their partners. \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" was a demo Trainor composed and recorded \"years ago\" that was excluded from the album's initial track listing. Trainor's uncle, however, insisted her management listen to the track. Upon hearing it, Trainor's manager started crying and said it had to appear on Title. Trainor then developed and produced the final version of \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" with a friend and sent it to American singer John Legend, who had the same management as Trainor. Legend replied, \"I love this, I want to be a part of it\", and later appeared on the track as a featured artist. Trainor felt the album's title track showcased her artistic style and said, \"I loved that 'Title' showed a little Caribbean drum before the chorus and then, like, a rap bridge that was, like\u00a0\u2026 [a] totally different sound\". She described it as \"call me your girlfriend, I'm sick of being your boo thing, so call me your girlfriend and give me that title\".  \"Lips Are Movin\" was written in eight minutes; it was inspired by a situation in which she caught one of her label colleagues lying and American singer Sara Bareilles' \"Love Song\" . She altered the song's subject to infidelity so her listeners could relate to it more. At the time of the track's development, Trainor reflected on her previous romantic relationship in which she was cheated on and her then-boyfriend's dismissal of her aspirations to become a pop star.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One day, he peeps into her bathroom while she bathes, and she complains about it to her malevolent stepmother, but she forgives and encourages him and tells her that they will one day marry. Sandhya also encourages Ravi, telling him that they will marry. When Sandhya's stepmother discovers their affair, she pokes her nose in their wheel. Ravi's father, who is very caring and loving, sends them to Chennai. After they reach Chennai, he checks in on them, and in the middle of the phone call, he is killed by Sandhya's stepmother. After that, a corrupt police officer named Mahesh accuses Ravi of murdering his own father and apprehends Ravi on a complaint given by Sandhya's stepmother that he had murdered his own father when he put his foot down on their affair. Ravi is then put behind bars. Sandhya is persuaded to seek the help of a judge named Needhi Manikkam to get a bail for Ravi. Manikkam, being an incorrect person, blackmails her into sleeping with him, causing her to spit on his face. Sandhya is taken to a palace by the police, where she gets gang-raped by Mahesh, Manikkam, and Tamil Kumaran , the son of Minister Janardhanan. In the meantime, an honest police officer releases Ravi, so that he can save Sandhya. But before Ravi can reach the destination, the trio removes her clothes, bind her to the bed, and rape her by turns, which they also take a video clip of. Ravi tries to save her but is unsuccessful and is beaten by Needhi Manikkam's henchmen. After some time, Sandhya becomes unconscious. Ravi is also unconscious after a severe beating from the goons and getting thrown into the gallows. After a series of events, Sandhya decides to commit suicide, because she says that she has undergone a lot of pain and anguish, and the pain is so terrible that she cannot forget it until she dies. Ravi is hesitant to let her go because he already lost his parents, and he does not want to lose her. He says that they have lived together, and he says that now that she has decided to die, they should die together because even during death, they should not part. At this juncture, here arrives a criminal lawyer named Sukran, who saves them, teaches them the value of life and advises them to face all the troubles boldly. After that, he tells them to start a new life and to be happy and successful by the time they meet again. They get jobs and money, marry, move into a small house, and have a normal life. One day, when Sandhya is in her nightdress, Mahesh, Manikkam, and Kumaran force her again, causing the couple to get harassed by the police. The incident causes Sandhya to be arrested on false charges of prostitution. All efforts by Ravi to get her out on bail are futile. An agitated Ravi shoots Mahesh, Manikkam, Kumaran, and Sandhya's stepmother dead and escapes with Sandhya from the court. Sukran steps in and promises to save the couple. He appears on Ravi's behalf and puts forward enough evidence to help him out. He also eventually kills Janardhanan, who was responsible for all the wrongdoings and also due to his previous disputes with him. After that, Sukran himself surrenders to the police, stating that although Janardhanan was a pervert, he should not have done the murder in front of the judge.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1805, Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C.\u00a0P.\u00a0E.\u00a0Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie. The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance his first keyboard concerto, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano. The first decades of the 19th century saw an increasing number of first publications of Bach's music: Breitkopf started publishing chorale preludes, Hoffmeister harpsichord music, and the Well-Tempered Clavier was printed concurrently by Simrock , N\u00e4geli and Hoffmeister in 1801. Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott . In 1818, Hans Georg N\u00e4geli called the Mass in B minor the greatest composition ever. Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers. When Felix Mendelssohn, Abraham's son, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, it is clear that he had been inspired by the then unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat. Felix Mendelssohn significantly contributed to the renewed interest in Bach's work with his 1829 Berlin performance of the St\u00a0Matthew Passion, which was instrumental in setting off what has been called the Bach Revival. The St John Passion saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and an increased coverage on the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 1840s also saw the first publication of more vocal works by Bach: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion, and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions saw their first publication in 1833. Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen \u00fcber den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter, Robert Franz, and Franz Liszt, or combined with new music such as the melody line of Charles Gounod's Ave Maria. Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner were among the composers who promoted Bach's music or wrote glowingly about it. In 1850, the  was founded to promote Bach's music. In the second half of the 19th century, the Society published a comprehensive edition of the composer's works. Also in the second half of the 19th century, Philipp Spitta published Johann Sebastian Bach, the standard work on Bach's life and music. By that time, Bach was known as the first of the three Bs in music. Throughout the 19th century, 200 books were published on Bach. By the end of the century, local Bach societies were established in several cities, and his music had been performed in all major musical centres. In Germany all throughout the century, Bach was coupled to nationalist feelings, and the composer was inscribed in a religious revival. In England, Bach was coupled to an existing revival of religious and baroque music. By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Gould likened his process to that of a film director\u2014one knows that a two-hour film was not made in two hours\u2014and implicitly asked why the recording music should be different. He went so far as to conduct an experiment with musicians, sound engineers, and laypeople in which they were to listen to a recording and determine where the splices occurred. Each group chose different points, but none was wholly successful. While the test was hardly scientific, Gould remarked, \"The tape does lie, and nearly always gets away with it\". In the lecture and essay \"Forgery and Imitation in the Creative Process\", one of his most significant texts, Gould makes explicit his views on authenticity and creativity. He asks why the epoch in which a work is received influences its reception as \"art\", postulating a sonata of his own composition that sounds so like one of Haydn's that it is received as such. If, instead, the sonata had been attributed to an earlier or later composer, it becomes more or less interesting as a piece of music. Yet it is not the work that has changed but its relation within the accepted narrative of music history. Similarly, Gould notes the \"pathetic duplicity\" in the reception of high-quality forgeries by Han van Meegeren of new paintings attributed to the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, before and after the forgery was known. Gould preferred an ahistorical, or at least pre-Renaissance, view of art, minimizing the identity of the artist and the attendant historical context in evaluating the artwork: \"What gives us the right to assume that in the work of art we must receive a direct communication with the historical attitudes of another period? ... moreover, what makes us assume that the situation of the man who wrote it accurately or faithfully reflects the situation of his time? ...

The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills, and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 . It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\" She answered \"Most of it.\" Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time. Derbyshire would not receive an on-screen credit until the 50th anniversary story \"The Day of the Doctor\" in 2013. A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 , which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 . Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for Doctor Who in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\". A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, \"Voyage of the Damned\"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series. He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers. In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special \"The Snowmen\", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" in November 2013. Versions of the \"Doctor Who Theme\" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, \"Who Is the Doctor\". In 1978, a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988, the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu released the single \"Doctorin' the Tardis\" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Gary Glitter . Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on The Chaser's War on Everything. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones.

The film is about a young man who falls in love with a beautiful woman whom he follows onto a luxury liner, where he discovers she is an English heiress who ran away from home and is now being returned to England. He also discovers that his boss is on the ship. To avoid discovery, he disguises himself as the gangster accomplice of a minister, who is actually a gangster on the run from the law. The film required revisions of Porter's saucy lyrics to pass Production Code censors. Only four of his songs remained: \"Anything Goes\", \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"There'll Always Be a Lady Fair\", and \"You're the Top\". \"You're the Top\" contained substantially revised lyrics, and only the first line was retained from the song \"Anything Goes\". Bing Crosby's influence was used to gut most of Porter's score and obtain four new songs from several new songwriters, Richard A. Whiting, Hoagy Carmichael, Leo Robin, Edward Heyman, and Friedrich Hollander, but other than \"Moonburn\", written by Hoagy Carmichael and Edward Heyman, which temporarily became a hit for Crosby,  it is usually agreed  that most of the replacement score was forgettable. Some, including movie musical expert John Springer, have criticized Paramount for substituting new songs by other composers for the originals.

The Bruneian Sultan then intervened in a territorial conflict between Hindu Tondo and Muslim Manila in the Philippines by appointing the Bruneian descended Rajah Ache of Manila as admiral of the Bruneian navy in a rivalry against Tondo and as the enforcer of Bruneian interests in the Philippines. He subsequently encountered the Magellan expedition wherein Antonio Pigafetta noted that under orders from his grandfather the Sultan of Brunei, Ache had previously sacked the Buddhist city of Loue in Southwest Borneo for being faithful to the old religion and rebelling against the authority of Sultanate. However, European influence gradually brought an end to Brunei's regional power, as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. In the face of these invasions by European Christian powers, the Ottoman Caliphate aided the beleaguered Southeast Asian Sultanates by making Aceh a protectorate and sending expeditions to reinforce, train and equip the local mujahideen. Turks were routinely migrating to Brunei as evidenced by the complaints of Manila Oidor Melchor Davalos who in his 1585 report, say that Turks were coming to Sumatra, Borneo and Ternate every year, including defeated veterans from the Battle of Lepanto. The presence of Turks assisting Brunei against Habsburg Spain, makes the subsequent Castille War a part of the Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars. Spain declared war in 1578, planning to attack and capture Kota Batu, Brunei's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two Bruneian noblemen, Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to Manila, then the centre of the Spanish colony. Manila itself was captured from Brunei, Christianised and made a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain which was centered in Mexico City. Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer Brunei as a tributary to Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new Bendahara. In March 1578, a fresh Spanish fleet had arrived from Mexico and settled at the Philippines, they were led by De Sande, acting as Capit\u00e1n-General, he organised an expedition from Manila for Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards and Mexicans, 1,500 Filipino natives and 300 Borneans. The campaign was one of many, which also included action in Mindanao and Sulu. The racial make-up of the Christian side was diverse since it were usually made up of Mestizos, Mulattoes and Amerindians who were gathered and sent from Mexico and were led by Spanish officers who had worked together with native Filipinos in military campaigns across the Southeast Asia. The Muslim side though was also equally racially diverse. In addition to the native Malay warriors, the Ottomans had repeatedly sent military expeditions to nearby Aceh. The expeditions were composed mainly of Turks, Egyptians, Swahilis, Somalis, Sindhis, Gujaratis and Malabars. These expeditionary forces had also spread to other nearby Sultanates such as Brunei and had taught new fighting tactics and techniques on how to forge cannons. Eventually, the Spanish invaded the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna, burning towns and raping populations. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to Jerudong. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. Suffering high fatalities due to a cholera or dysentery outbreak, the Spanish decided to abandon Brunei and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof. Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his Spanish allies. There was suspicion that he the legitimist sultan could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan. Seri Lela's daughter, a Bruneian princess, \"Putri\", had left with the Spanish, she abandoned her claim to the crown and then she married a Christian Tagalog, named Agust\u00edn de Legazpi de Tondo. Agustin de Legaspi along with his family and associates were soon implicated in the Conspiracy of the Maharlikas, an attempt by Filipinos to link up with the Brunei Sultanate and Japanese Shogunate to expel the Spaniards from the Philippines. However, upon the Spanish suppression of the conspiracy, the Bruneian descended aristocracy of precolonial Manila were exiled to Guerrero, Mexico which consequently later became a center of the Mexican war of independence against Spain. The local Brunei accounts of the Castilian War differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam, purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a folk-hero account, which probably developed decades or centuries after. Brunei eventually descended into anarchy. The country suffered a civil war from 1660 to 1673.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It hosts the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia , for which new concert halls have been built in the new Parco della Musica, one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 and the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004. Rome has also had a major impact on music history. The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms. Between 1960 and 1970 Rome was considered to be as a \u201cnew Hollywood\u201d because of the many actors and directors who worked there; Via Vittorio Veneto had transformed into a glamour place where you could meet famous people.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song was introduced in the Broadway production by Dorothy Sarnoff in the role of Lady Thiang, the King's head wife. In the 1956 film adaptation \"Something Wonderful\" was sung by Terry Saunders in the role of Lady Thiang: Saunders was the understudy for Sarnoff in the Broadway production and, in 1952, had taken over the role when Sarnoff departed. \"Something Wonderful\" is sung by Lady Thiang to Anna Leonowens to persuade her to accept the King for what he is, despite his faults. In a sense, these lyrics have echoes of the song \"What's the Use of Wond'rin'\" from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel, which also deals with the issue of women standing by their husbands despite all their faults. Musically, the heavy chords that punctuate the accompaniment bear some pre-echoes of the song \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" from The Sound of Music. This is notable because both these songs are inspirational songs sung by the earth-mother characters, who have similar singing voices. Both songs are also the last songs heard in their respective shows, even though \"Something Wonderful\" is played as an instrumental rendition to underscore the final scene of the King at his deathbed. In the film version of The King and I an unseen chorus sings the final verse of \"Something Wonderful\" as the film concludes. A most recent occurrence of the song is when it is sung as a tragic satire near the end of the 2020 movie, Promising Young Woman.", "hasanswer": true}]}

This was the composer's first encounter with the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique, as the Paris Op\u00e9ra was officially known. Among 19th-century Italian composers, there had been an increasing interest in writing for Paris, where the combination of money, prestige, and flexibility of style were appealing.  Musicologist Julian Budden provides examples of those composers who had crossed the Alps, the most well-known being Rossini and Donizetti However, Verdi had given some consideration of the idea of adapting one of the librettos written by Temistocle Solera in earlier years, librettos which music historian David Kimball regards as having something of grand opera in their structure. After conducting the premiere of I masnadieri in London and within a week of Verdi's arrival in Paris on 27 July 1847, he received his first commission from the company, agreeing to adapt I Lombardi to a new French libretto. The adaptation meant that Verdi could \"try his hand at grand opera\" without having to write something entirely new, a strategy which both Donizetti and Rossini had employed for their Paris debuts. There are significant changes in the location and action of the French version of Lombardi, especially given the need to set the story for French involvement in the First Crusade of 1095\u20131099. Characters' names changed from Italian to French and one, Arvino was now a baritone instead of a tenor. Several roles present in the original version were deleted, including the leading tenor role of Oronte. In the restructured libretto, the central romance is given more prominence, and a happier ending.  In addition, Verdi added a standard ballet and new music, but re-shaped much of the structure by removing inappropriate material he felt to be weak.  As musicologist Roger Parker notes, \"only a few of the original numbers [remain] in their former positions.\"  Verdi himself described the new work as having \"transformed [I Lombardi] out of recognition\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The DSP trains Velu and sends him back to Billa's gang, disguised as an amnesiac Billa, who had been hiding at an apartment complex due to his injuries. Slowly Velu starts to learn about Billa's gang and even speaks to Jagdish, Billa's boss, on the phone.

During the course of a long career, Franck held teaching positions at conservatories in both Germany and in Switzerland . Although he did not reach the front rank amongst his contemporaries, he was nevertheless well respected as a concert artist and as a composer. His conservative style was influenced by Reinecke and by his friend, the Swiss composer Hans Huber . Franck was firmly in the tradition of Mendelssohn and Schumann though it's clear that he was not immune from the influence of Wagner, Grieg and Reger also.  Critics who were familiar with his compositions and his piano playing regularly lavished praised upon them. For example, the Schweizerische Musikzeitung , writing about his First Piano Trio, Op. 20, wrote: \"Powerful and full-sounding energy is shown in many works, not least in [Richard Franck's] Op.20 Piano Trio, which is a magnificent, significant composition, fresh in invention, firm and secure in its development, and mature in its expression.\" The bulk of Franck's compositions are for solo piano; however, he also wrote orchestral and vocal compositions, as well as a considerable amount of chamber music.

Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music. Italy's most famous composers include the Renaissance composers Palestrina, Monteverdi and Gesualdo, the Baroque composers Scarlatti, Corelli and Vivaldi, the Classical composers Paisiello, Paganini and Rossini, and the Romantic composers Verdi and Puccini. Modern Italian composers such as Berio and Nono proved significant in the development of experimental and electronic music. While the classical music tradition still holds strong in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its innumerable opera houses, such as La Scala of Milan and San Carlo of Naples , and performers such as the pianist Maurizio Pollini and tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Italians have been no less appreciative of their thriving contemporary music scene. Italy is widely known for being the birthplace of opera. Italian opera was believed to have been founded in the early 17th century, in cities such as Mantua and Venice. Later, works and pieces composed by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are among the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. La Scala operahouse in Milan is also renowned as one of the best in the world. Famous Italian opera singers include Enrico Caruso and Alessandro Bonci. Introduced in the early 1920s, jazz took a particularly strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite the xenophobic cultural policies of the Fascist regime. Today, the most notable centres of jazz music in Italy include Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Later, Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock and pop movement of the 1970s, with bands like PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Goblin, and Pooh. The same period saw diversification in the cinema of Italy, and Cinecitt\u00e0 films included complex scores by composers including Ennio Morricone, Armando Trovaioli, Piero Piccioni and Piero Umiliani. In the early 1980s, the first star to emerge from the Italian hip hop scene was singer Jovanotti. Italian metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse. Italy contributed to the development of disco and electronic music, with Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and drum machines, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from Euro disco . By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as Italo dance emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. Notable Italian DJs and remixers include Gabry Ponte , Benny Benassi, Gigi D'Agostino, and the trio Tacabro. Producers such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes for his music, were highly influential in the development of electronic dance music. Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision song contest, and the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto. Singers such as Mina, Andrea Bocelli, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, Zucchero, Eros Ramazzotti and Tiziano Ferro have attained international acclaim.

They met outside one of the comedy clubs that Marc owns when both were taking a smoke break. She weighs 179\u00a0lbs. and he weighs 241\u00a0lbs. After the first grueling workout, the women are taken away for a more fun activity: dress shopping! However, the activity is \"bitter-sweet\" for Lindsey and some of the other girls due to their current weights. The men also spend some time looking at outfits for the big day at a tuxedo shop. This shopping trip serves as motivation for many of the contestants. After everyone tries on their dream wedding gowns and tuxedos, they meet up with Sara Rue, the hostess of the show. Sara tells everyone that their first challenge will be a dancing competition and the winners will get their dream outfits. The couples must maintain a combined heart-rate of 225 beats per minute to start in order to stay in the competition, and each song results in a higher heart-rate requirement. Ginny and Marc are the first couple to be eliminated. After a few more minutes of intense dancing, running, and jumping jacks, all the couples were eliminated, leaving Laeresa and Stephen as the winners. The weigh-in ceremony was very similar to the weigh-ins on The Biggest Loser, however, the two couples who had the lowest percentage of weight loss immediately faced off in an elimination challenge called \"Til Death Do Us Part,\" and that their weights were reported as a combined total, not individually. Sara also revealed that at the end of the season, all of the eliminated contestants would come back and compete for a dream honeymoon vacation. When all was said and done, Dawn and Adam lost the most percentage of weight with a grand total of 7.28% lost. The two couples that ended up in the \"Til Death Do Us Part\" elimination challenge were Ginny and Marc and Lindsey and Chase. The challenge required the couples to not only keep a 200-pound weight off the ground, but bid to see how long they could do it for. Lindsey and Chase won the bid with a time of three minutes and were allowed to stay in the competition. Ginny and Marc were eliminated.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The one-movement piano concerto was fully orchestrated by the composer, while the second and fourth movements were later orchestrated by Sergei Taneyev, Tchaikovsky's friend and fellow composer. While the first movement sketches and completed version for piano and orchestra were essentially complete, Bogatyrev found that only 81 of the 204 bars of the second movement were in Tchaikovsky's hand.  Here he utilized Tchaikovsky's piano score for the Andante for Piano and Orchestra, Taneyev's orchestration, and a very rough draft by Tchaikovsky. For the third movement, Bogatyrev followed the insistence of the composer's brother Modest that this should be a scherzo, and orchestrated a scherzo from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72 piano pieces, as well as more sketches by the composer.  Remarkably, the piece fits neatly between the second and fourth movements and even includes final chords that are echoed by the beginning of the fourth movement. The reconstruction of the fourth movement was based on the piano score for the Finale for Piano and Orchestra, the composer's sketches, and the published orchestration by Taneyev.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Through a series of flashbacks, Martin is shown as a child, distrustful of his own mother. She describes to him the garden outside his bedroom window. She tells him that someone is raking leaves, but he can't hear the sound and angrily decides she is lying to him. This childhood experience strongly affects Martin as an adult, as he anticipates that sighted people will take advantage of his blindness to lie to him, or worse yet, pity him. He has become a resentful, vaguely bitter person who spends his days taking some photographs of the world around him, then having various people describe them. He uses these photographs and the Braille descriptions before he stamps on them as \"proof\" that the world around him really is as others describe it to him. He also takes secret pleasure in rebuking the romantic advances of Celia , his housekeeper. Celia harbors a deep-seated and obsessive crush on Martin, as evidenced by the scores of photographs of him adorning the walls of her flat, and takes out her frustration at her unrequited love by tormenting Martin in small ways, such as rearranging the furniture in his house. Martin keeps Celia around because her love and hatred of him means he knows she can't pity him. One day Martin encounters Andy , and is pleased with the depth and detail with which Andy describes his photos. The two fast become close friends, and Martin soon comes to trust him implicitly. The jealous Celia is threatened by Andy's increasing presence in Martin's life. She seduces Andy, and Martin catches the two in the act, before Andy reluctantly lies to him about it. Celia recognizes this opportunity to foil Martin yet again, and sets up a series of events leading Martin to discover Andy's dishonesty. Martin is devastated and plunged into a deep despair, and breaks off his friendship with Andy. Later on, Andy confronts him, and tries to convince him that everyone has flaws, and shouldn't be judged on such simple terms. \"People lie,\" he tells Martin, \"but not all the time. And that's the point.\" Martin doesn't respond, but is swayed by Andy's impassioned words. Near the story's conclusion, Martin decides to fire Celia, but acknowledges his own role in purposely antagonizing her in their love-hate relationship. Despite his openness she is extremely angry that her efforts have gone to waste, and when asked to return her key to Martin's house, she throws it in a sink full of water. Finally, Martin asks Andy to describe one last photo for him, one he has kept locked away for years.

Nevertheless, during his life, Bach received public recognition, such as the title of court composer by Augustus III of Poland and the appreciation he was shown by Frederick the Great and Hermann Karl von Keyserling. Such highly placed appreciation contrasted with the humiliations he had to cope with, for instance in Leipzig. Also in the contemporary press, Bach had his detractors, such as Johann Adolf Scheibe, suggesting he write less complex music, and his supporters, such as Johann Mattheson and Lorenz Christoph Mizler. After his death, Bach's reputation as a composer at first declined: his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging galant style. Initially, he was remembered more as a virtuoso player of the organ and as a teacher. The bulk of the music that had been printed during the composer's lifetime, at least the part that was remembered, was for the organ and the harpsichord. Thus, his reputation as a composer was initially mostly limited to his keyboard music, and that even fairly limited to its value in music education. Bach's surviving family members, who inherited a large part of his manuscripts, were not all equally concerned with preserving them, leading to considerable losses. Carl Philipp Emanuel, his second eldest son, was most active in safeguarding his father's legacy: he co-authored his father's obituary, contributed to the publication of his four-part chorales, staged some of his works, and the bulk of previously unpublished works of his father were preserved with his help. Wilhelm Friedemann, the eldest son, performed several of his father's cantatas in Halle but after becoming unemployed sold part of the large collection of his father's works he owned. Several students of the old master, such as his son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnickol, Johann Friedrich Agricola, Johann Kirnberger, and Johann Ludwig Krebs, contributed to the dissemination of his legacy. The early devotees were not all musicians; for example, in Berlin, Daniel Itzig, a high official of Frederick the Great's court, venerated Bach. His eldest daughters took lessons from Kirnberger and their sister Sara from Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, who was in Berlin from 1774 to 1784. Sara Itzig Levy became an avid collector of works by Johann Sebastian Bach and his sons and was a \"patron\" of CPE Bach. While in Leipzig, performances of Bach's church music were limited to some of his motets, and under cantor Doles some of his Passions. A new generation of Bach aficionados emerged: they studiously collected and copied his music, including some of his large-scale works such as the Mass in B minor and performed it privately. One such connoisseur was Gottfried van Swieten, a high-ranking Austrian official who was instrumental in passing Bach's legacy on to the composers of the Viennese school. Haydn owned manuscript copies of the Well-Tempered Clavier and the Mass in B minor and was influenced by Bach's music. Mozart owned a copy of one of Bach's motets, transcribed some of his instrumental works , and wrote contrapuntal music influenced by his style.

The theme uses a four-note motif used in Goldsmith's Star Trek V: The Final Frontier score, which is used in First Contact as a friendship theme and general thematic link.Bond, 156. A menacing march with touches of synthesizers was used to represent the Borg. In addition to composing new music, Goldsmith used music from his previous Star Trek scores, including his theme from The Motion Picture. The Klingon theme from the same film is used to represent Worf. Because of delays with Paramount's The Ghost and the Darkness, the already-short four-week production schedule was cut to just three weeks. While Berman was concerned about the move, Goldsmith hired his son, Joel, to assist. The young composer provided additional music for the film, writing three cues based on his father's motifs and a total of 22\u00a0minutes of music. Joel used variations of his father's Borg music and the Klingon theme as Worf fights hand-to-hand . When the Borg invade sickbay and the medical hologram distracts them, Joel wrote what critic Jeff Bond termed \"almost Coplandesque\" material of tuning strings and clarinet, but the cue was unused. While Joel composed many of the film's action cues, his father contributed to the spacewalk and Phoenix flight sequences. During the fight on the deflector dish, Goldsmith used low-register electronics punctuated by stabs of violent, dissonant strings.

Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. George Harrison got into a shouting match with Lennon after Ono took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking. The English press dubbed Ono \"the woman who broke up the Beatles\", which had been foreseen by Paul McCartney in 1969 during the group's rehearsals for their film and album Let It Be, when he said \"It's going to be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in fifty years' time, you know: 'They broke up 'cause Yoko sat on an amp.'\" In an interview with Dick Cavett, Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up the Beatles, and Harrison said during an interview with Cavett that the problems within the group began long before Ono came onto the scene. Ono herself has said that the Beatles broke up without any direct involvement from her, adding \"I don't think I could have tried even to break them up.\" While the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as Lennon\u2013McCartney regardless of whether the song was a collaboration or written solely by one of the two . In 1976, McCartney released a live album called Wings over America, which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney\u2013J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney\u2013Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as \"Yesterday\", but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making \"an attempt to rewrite history\". In a Rolling Stone interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney's place in the disintegration of the band. On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, Lennon Legend, the composer credit of \"Give Peace a Chance\" was changed to \"John Lennon\" from its original composing credit of \"Lennon\u2013McCartney\". Although Lennon wrote the song during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon's first independent single under the \"Plastic Ono Band\" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song. In 2002, McCartney released another live album, Back in the U.S. Live 2002, and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as \"composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon\", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it \"an attempt to rewrite history\". Nevertheless, Ono did not sue. In 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon's \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song \"Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue\", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of that Japanese city. Of Ono, McCartney stated: \"I thought she was a cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself.\" Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney's wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time. When Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in Manhattan. Accepting an award at the 2005 Q Awards, Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, \"You're a good songwriter. It's not June with spoon that you write. You're a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs.\" In an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon's \"lost weekend\" and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John. \"I want the world to know that it was a very touching thing that [Paul] did for John.\" While visiting Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked \"[W]hat will make you come back to John?\" McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles. \"John often said he didn't understand why Paul did this for us, but he did.\" In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon's post-Beatles work.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Featuring a book by Linda Kline and Lonny Price along with music and lyrics by Kleban himself, the musical uses flashbacks and the device of time running backwards to retrace the high and low points of the composer's personal and professional life. The original production concept was haphazardly thrown together by Kleban's close friend and author of the book by using a trunkful of songs that Kleban had written for a number of unproduced musicals, and writing new scenes or reworking original scenes around them, with Price polishing up the results. In addition to serving as a tribute to one of the award-winning collaborators of A Chorus Line, A Class Act provides yet another behind-the-scenes glimpse at how a musical is created and brought to the stage. In contrast to A Chorus Line however, the piece offers a considerably more severe warning as well about how an artist's personal life\u2014including struggles with mental illness and cancer\u2014can interfere with, obstruct, and eventually doom his professional as well as his personal pursuits.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Toho's interpretation differed greatly from the original in size and abilities. Among kaiju, King Kong was suggested to be among the most powerful in terms of raw physical force, possessing strength and durability that rivaled that of Godzilla. As one of the few mammal-based kaiju, Kong's most distinctive feature was his intelligence. He demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to an opponent's fighting style, identify and exploit weaknesses in an enemy, and utilize his environment to stage ambushes and traps. In King Kong vs. Godzilla, Kong was scaled to be  tall. This version of Kong was given the ability to harvest electricity as a weapon and draw strength from electrical voltage. In King Kong Escapes, Kong was scaled to be  tall. This version was more similar to the original, where he relied on strength and intelligence to fight and survive. Rather than residing on Skull Island, Toho's version of Kong resided on Faro Island in King Kong vs. Godzilla and on Mondo Island in King Kong Escapes. In 1966, Toho planned to produce Operation Robinson Crusoe: King Kong vs. Ebirah as a co-production with Rankin/Bass Productions, however Ishir\u014d Honda was unavailable at the time to direct the film and, as a result, Rankin/Bass backed out of the project, along with the King Kong license. Toho still proceeded with the production, replacing King Kong with Godzilla at the last minute and shot the film as Ebirah, Horror of the Deep. Elements of King Kong's character remained in the film, reflected in Godzilla's uncharacteristic behavior and attraction to the female character Daiyo. Toho and Rankin/Bass later negotiated their differences and co-produced King Kong Escapes in 1967, loosely based on Rankin/Bass' animated show. Toho Studios wanted to remake King Kong vs. Godzilla, which was the most successful of the entire Godzilla series of films, in 1991 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film, as well as to celebrate Godzilla's upcoming 40th anniversary. However, they were unable to obtain the rights to use Kong, and initially intended to use Mechani-Kong as Godzilla's next adversary. But it was soon learned that even using a mechanical creature who resembled Kong would be just as problematic legally and financially for them. As a result, the film became Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, with one last failed attempt made to use Kong in 2004's Godzilla: Final Wars.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The orchestra was conducted by James Shearman. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as bagpipes, a solo fiddle, Celtic harps, flutes and the bodhr\u00e1n, with an electronically treated dulcimer and cimbalom to give it a more contemporary feel. \"I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as reels, jigs, and strathspeys, which not only serve the action but keep it authentic,\" said Doyle. As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying \"unaccompanied Gaelic psalm singing.\" Doyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled \"A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan \" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language. The drinking song \"Song of Mor'du\" sung by Billy Connolly, Scott Davies, Patrick Doyle, Gordon Neville, Alex Norton and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in Scots, which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. In addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; \"Learn Me Right\" written by Mumford & Sons and performed with Birdy, \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" . Both \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" were performed by Julie Fowlis, as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts.

Each group chose different points, but none was wholly successful. While the test was hardly scientific, Gould remarked, \"The tape does lie, and nearly always gets away with it\". In the lecture and essay \"Forgery and Imitation in the Creative Process\", one of his most significant texts, Gould makes explicit his views on authenticity and creativity. He asks why the epoch in which a work is received influences its reception as \"art\", postulating a sonata of his own composition that sounds so like one of Haydn's that it is received as such. If, instead, the sonata had been attributed to an earlier or later composer, it becomes more or less interesting as a piece of music. Yet it is not the work that has changed but its relation within the accepted narrative of music history. Similarly, Gould notes the \"pathetic duplicity\" in the reception of high-quality forgeries by Han van Meegeren of new paintings attributed to the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, before and after the forgery was known. Gould preferred an ahistorical, or at least pre-Renaissance, view of art, minimizing the identity of the artist and the attendant historical context in evaluating the artwork: \"What gives us the right to assume that in the work of art we must receive a direct communication with the historical attitudes of another period? ... moreover, what makes us assume that the situation of the man who wrote it accurately or faithfully reflects the situation of his time? ... What if the composer, as historian, is faulty?\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_942", "question": "Who was the composer of Memories?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_37435", "text": "Because of the suffering under slavery, most people who had been enslaved tried to repress these memories in an attempt to forget the past.  This repression and dissociation from the past causes a fragmentation of the self and a loss of true identity. Sethe, Paul D., and Denver all suffered a loss of self, which could only be remedied when they were able to reconcile their pasts and memories of earlier identities. Beloved serves to remind these characters of their repressed memories, eventually leading to the reintegration of their selves. Slavery splits a person into a fragmented figure. The identity, consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past, denied and kept at bay, becomes a \"self that is no self\". To heal and humanize, one must constitute it in a language, reorganize the painful events, and retell the painful memories. As a result of suffering, the \"self\" becomes subject to a violent practice of making and unmaking, once acknowledged by an audience becomes real. Sethe, Paul D, and Baby Suggs, who all fall short of such realization, are unable to remake themselves by trying to keep their pasts at bay. The \"self\" is located in a word, defined by others. The power lies in the audience, or more precisely, in the word\u2014once the word changes, so does the identity. All of the characters in Beloved face the challenge of an unmade self, composed of their \"rememories\" and defined by perceptions and language. The barrier that keeps them from remaking of the self is the desire for an \"uncomplicated past\" and the fear that remembering will lead them to \"a place they couldn't get back from\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

On the way, she is bothered by the constantly blowing wind. Fellow passenger and cattle buyer Wirt Roddy makes her acquaintance and tells her the wind usually drives women crazy. Upon arrival, she is picked up by Beverly's closest neighbors, Lige Hightower and the older, balding Sourdough , who live 15 miles from her cousin. Wirt assures her he will drop by occasionally to see how she is doing. After endless miles in sand and wind, they arrive at the ranch. Beverly is delighted to see her, but his jealous wife Cora gives her a cold reception, despite Letty saying she and Beverly are like brother and sister. Cora is further angered when her children seem to like Letty better. At a party, Sourdough tells Lige that he intends proposing to Letty. Lige explains he was planning to do the same. After Wirt drops by, a cyclone interrupts the festivities. Most of the guests seek shelter in the basement, where Wirt declares his love for Letty and offers to take her away from the dismal place. After the cyclone passes, Lige and Sourdough talk to Letty in private. When they flip a coin to see who will ask for her hand in marriage , Letty thinks it is just a joke. Afterward, Cora demands that Letty leave the ranch. Because she has neither money nor a place to go, she decides to go away with Wirt, but then Wirt reveals that he wants her for a mistress, informing her that he already has a wife. She goes back to Cora, who tells her to choose from her two other suitors. She marries Lige. When Lige takes her home, he kisses Letty for the first time, but her lack of enthusiasm is unmistakable. Worse for the drink, he becomes more forceful, and she tells him she hates him. He promises he will never touch her, and will try to make enough money to send her back to Virginia. In the meantime, Letty works around the house, but is bothered by the ever-present wind. One day, Lige is invited to a meeting of the cattlemen, who must do something to avoid starvation. Letty, terrified of being left alone with the wind, begs to go with him, and he agrees. After she cannot control her horse in the fierce wind, he has her get on behind him on his horse. When she falls off, Lige tells Sourdough to take her home. When the cattlemen return, they bring an unwanted guest, an injured Wirt. After he recovers, Lige insists he participate in a roundup of wild horses to raise money for the cattlemen. Wirt goes along, but later sneaks away and returns to Letty. Out of her mind with fear as she endures the house shaking from the worst wind storm yet, Letty faints soon after Wirt's arrival. He picks her up and carries her to the bed. The next morning, Wirt tries to persuade Letty to go away with him, but she coldly rejects him.  He insists, noting Lige will kill them both if they remain.  As Wirt becomes more aggressive, Letty picks up Wirt's revolver from the table to defend herself.  Confident that Letty will not fire, Wirt grabs the gun and it goes off, killing him. At first startled by Wirt's death, Letty looks confusedly at him and at the gun in her hand; she then decides to bury him outside. After she is done, she goes back inside the cabin. The wind blows into an even greater fury, and Letty stares with mounting fear through a window as the wind gradually uncovers Wirt's body, terrifying her.  Letty runs away from the window, but then sees two hands clasped around the cabin's door trying to force it open; Letty hysterically believes it is Wirt returned from the dead, and falls prone with terror, her face hidden, as someone enters. The hands turn her over, and Letty stares upward blank with madness. However, it is actually Lige, who has returned. After a few moments, Letty returns to sanity and recognizes Lige; she is so glad to see him, she frantically kisses her husband. She then confesses she killed and buried Wirt. When Lige looks outside, however, the corpse is nowhere to be seen. He tells Letty that the wind can remove traces when a killing is justified. He has enough money to send her away, but Letty declares that she loves him, that she no longer wants to leave, and that she is no longer afraid of the wind or anything else.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_944", "question": "Who was the composer of Perfect Day?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_76196", "text": "Ryo likes expressing human emotions in his music, so for Today Is A Beautiful Day, he wanted to combine feelings such as lifelong experiences and memories. He describes the process as expressing each memory as an individual story. Ryo composed the songs on the album around the idea of starting and ending with \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" . As such, the second track on the album is \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", and the final track \"Watashi e\" uses the same tune. For \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\", Ryo was offered to compose the ending theme song to the 2009 anime series Bakemonogatari. Ryo did not want to copy the tone or style of the original Bakemonogatari novels, because he felt the author Nisio Isin would enjoy the song more if it was more original. Thus, Ryo wrote a different story after borrowing the general setting of the novels. While creating the album, Ryo thought it would be interesting if the first song on the album was the end of the story. The album's first track \"Owari e Mukau Hajimari no Uta\" was composed with the image of starting with a flashback scene, diving into the past, and once again returning to the present. For \"Hero\", Ryo was asked to compose a theme song for Shueisha's manga magazine Aoharu, a special edition version of Young Jump. The artists whose manga would be serialized in Aoharu were asked to draw \"heroines they think are cute,\" and Ryo was asked to compose the song with the same theme. Ryo thought of a boy aiming to be a manga artist as the song's protagonist, and wrote it with the concept of wanting to support those who get victimized for being otaku. Since the song reflects different points of view between the protagonist and the heroine, Nagi Yanagi switches her singing style from cool to cute sounding. Ryo describes \"Perfect Day\" with an image close to the album title and feels the song symbolizes the album. \"Perfect Day\" was born from the nuance that undoubtedly tomorrow will be a perfect day. Ryo wrote the song \"Fukush\u016b\" with the theme of anger, and was influenced by \"Snow White\" to include a line in the song describing someone being told to wear red hot iron shoes and dance. Ryo wanted a song to describe emotions that would continue past adolescence, compared to the rest of the songs on the album. Yanagi found it difficult to capture the right emotions in the song. \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\" was composed with a strong drum component as the initial concept and Ryo wanted to create a song with a fast tempo and rock and roll nuance to it; the song's tempo is over 200 beats per minute. Ryo worked in collaboration with Yanagi to write the song based on the initial demo. Ryo did not initially intend on putting \"Love & Roll\" on the album, but others in the staff convinced him to include it. For the middle of the album, Ryo wanted a lower tempo song with a different mood and composed \"Feel So Good\" based on this concept. When it was decided Ryo would compose the theme song to Type-Moon's visual novel Mah\u014dtsukai no Yoru, he first read the original novel by Kinoko Nasu the visual novel is based on to get a feel for the work. Ryo wrote \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" for the theme song, and there was not much trial and error in the composition of this song. Fireworks were an influence in the writing of \"Utakata Hanabi\" . Ryo wanted the song to reflect how fireworks, which are initially brilliant, are hard to vividly remember afterwards. \"Yoru ga Akeru yo\" was the last song on the album Ryo composed, and was born from the feeling of lying in bed being unable to sleep. Ryo was inspired by the layout of the room where he works and how when dawn is breaking, the temperature slowly starts to rise, and a school near his home starts to bustle. Since \"Sayonara Memories\" was initially released in February 2010, Ryo used that month as the song's theme. He attempted to write a song that reflected February as the time of year in Japan when people are reminded of farewells they made the previous year, as well as the time when people think about meeting others for the first time. The last song \"Watashi e\" is meant to convey perseverance through tough times. While Ryo writes all the music, an assortment of session musicians perform the songs on the album, including four guitarists and bassists, five drummers, three pianists, and a violinist. Ryo cites drummer Masayuki Muraishi as an influence in the composition of \"Rock 'n' Roll Nan desu no\"; Muraishi contributes on several songs on the album. In composing \"Feel So Good\", Ryo employed bassist Kenji Hino, son of Terumasa Hino, after he became interested in a performance of his on a TV music program. Ryo felt using strings in \"Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni\" was an essential part of the song; Crusher Kimura provides the strings for three songs on the album. Haruko Ohinata is credited for the chorus of the song \"Utakata Hanabi\". Today Is A Beautiful Day was mixed by Takeshi Hara, Yasuhisa Kataoka, Keiji Kondo, Masashi Kudo, Eiji Makino, Koji Morimoto, Okuda Supa, and Shuji Yamaguchi.

{"id": "639_945", "question": "Who was the composer of Imagine This?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_66435", "text": "Several poems from Yoko Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit inspired Lennon to write the lyrics for \"Imagine\" \u2013 in particular, one which Capitol Records reproduced on the back cover of the original Imagine LP titled \"Cloud Piece\", reads: \"Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in.\" Lennon later said the composition \"should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it \u2013 the lyric and the concept \u2013 came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit.\" When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind \"Imagine\". With the combined influence of \"Cloud Piece\" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as \"a humanistic paean for the people\". Blaney wrote, \"Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential.\" Rolling Stones David Fricke commented: \"[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class.\" Lennon stated: \"'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\" He told NME: \"There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism.\" Ono described the lyrical statement of \"Imagine\" as \"just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people.\" Rolling Stone described its lyrics as \"22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself\". The original piano musical motif was created in January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions. Lennon finished composing \"Imagine\" one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session. Described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar outro begins with F, then G, before resolving on C. With a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a time signature of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 beats per minute.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After a series of successful performances in London, Mendelssohn embarked on a walking tour of Scotland with his friend Karl Klingemann. On 30 July, Mendelssohn visited the ruins of Holyrood Chapel at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, where, as he related to his family in a letter, he received his initial inspiration for the piece: Alongside this description, Mendelssohn enclosed in his letter a scrap of paper with the opening bars of what would become the symphony's opening theme. A few days later Mendelssohn and his companion visited the western coast of Scotland and the island of Staffa, which in turn inspired the composer to start the Hebrides. After completing the first version of the Hebrides, Mendelssohn continued to work on his initial sketches of what would become Symphony No. 3 while touring Italy.  However, he struggled to make progress, and after 1831 set the piece aside. It is not known exactly when Mendelssohn resumed work on the symphony but he was certainly working in earnest on the piece by 1841 and completed the symphony in Berlin on 20 January 1842. It was slightly revised after early performances, excising 111 bars of material in total, and the revised version is the one almost universally performed. Although it was the fifth and final of Mendelssohn's symphonies to be completed, it was the third to be published, and has subsequently been known as Symphony No. 3.  Intriguingly, despite describing the work as his 'Scottish Symphony' to his family in 1829, by the time the work was published in 1842 Mendelssohn never publicly called attention to the symphony's Scottish inspiration, and it is debatable whether he intended the finished work to be considered 'Scottish'. Ever since the Scottish provenance became known following the composer's death, however, audiences have found it hard not to hear the piece as evoking the wild Romantic landscapes of the north - even if such picturesque associations have caused audiences to overlook the many other musical qualities of this symphony.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Also in May 1977, former Gong musician Mike Howlett invited Sting to join him in the band project Strontium 90. The drummer Howlett had in mind, Chris Cutler, was unavailable, so Sting took Copeland. The band's fourth member was guitarist Andy Summers. A decade older than Sting and Copeland, Summers was a music industry veteran who had played with Eric Burdon and the Animals and Kevin Ayers among others. Strontium 90 performed at a Gong reunion concert in Paris on 28 May 1977, and played at a London club in July. The band also recorded several demo tracks: these were released 20 years later on the archive album Strontium 90: Police Academy. Summers's musicality impressed Sting, who was becoming frustrated with Padovani's rudimentary abilities and the limitations they imposed on The Police's potential. Shortly after the Strontium 90 gig, Sting approached Summers to join the band. He agreed, on the condition the band remain a trio, with him replacing Padovani. Restrained by loyalty, Copeland and Sting resisted the idea, and The Police carried on as a four-piece version. However, they only performed live twice: on 25 July 1977 at the Music Machine in London and on 5 August at the Mont de Marsan Punk Festival. Shortly after these two gigs , Summers delivered an ultimatum to the band and Padovani was dismissed leaving him free to join Wayne County & The Electric Chairs. The effect of Summers's arrival was instant: Copeland said: \"One by one, Sting's songs had started coming in, and when Andy joined, it opened up new numbers of Sting's we could do, so the material started to get a lot more interesting and Sting started to take a lot more interest in the group.\" The Police's power trio line-up of Copeland, Sting, and Summers performed for the first time on 18 August 1977 at Rebecca's club in Birmingham in the West Midlands. A trio was unusual for the time, and this line-up endured for the rest of the band's history. Few punk bands were three-pieces, while contemporary bands pursuing progressive rock, symphonic rock and other sound trends usually expanded their line-ups with support players. The musical background of all three players may have made them suspect to punk purists, with music critic Christopher Gable stating, The band were also able to draw on influences from reggae to jazz to progressive and pub rock. While still maintaining the main band and attempting to win over punk audiences, Police members continued to moonlight within the art rock scene. In late 1977 and early 1978, Sting and Summers recorded and performed as part of an ensemble led by German experimental composer Eberhard Schoener; Copeland also joined for a time. These performances resulted in three albums, each of them an eclectic mix of rock, electronica and jazz. Various appearances by the Schoener outfit on German television made the German public aware of Sting's unusual high-pitched voice, and helped pave the way for The Police's later popularity. The bleached-blond hair that became a band trademark happened by accident. In February 1978, the band, desperate for money, was asked to do a commercial for Wrigley's Spearmint chewing gum on the condition they dye their hair blond. The commercial was shot with the band, but was shelved and never aired.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_962", "question": "Who was the composer of Voices?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_77754", "text": "Faith's music displays a freely modulating harmonic language within the boundaries of tonality that combines neo-romantic and impressionistic qualities. With Debussy, Ravel, and Rachmaninoff as important influences on his music, and Brahms as a model with respect to form, Faith also shares musical traits with Vaughan Williams, particularly in the areas of modality and harmonic color and with Roger Quilter, the Victorian whose songs displayed a trait known as \"decorous Romanticism.\" Faith's English flavor is even further highlighted by the composer's choice of poetry, much of which comes from English and Irish authors. Having developed a somewhat dry wit and an infectious, silly humor, Faith infrequently reflected these personality traits in his music, leaning more toward a sound that exudes a deep longing and romantic spirit. Faith's song output spans the years 1944 to the present\u2014his entire life as a composer. The over 120 settings run the stylistic gamut from sophisticated concert pieces to simple miniatures, duets, vocalises and selections with obbligato instruments, including flute, cello, viola and harp. His settings are generally for medium voice. Some have been written for specific singers to whom he has dedicated the music. Many of the songs are grouped according to subject matter, but are not necessarily musically connected. They may be sung as sets or separately, and may be transposed to suit the singer. Faith's tempo indications use traditional Italian terminology and the metronome markings are only suggestions. He is a gracious composer who allows individuals to develop their own interpretations of his music. Because Faith himself is a pianist, many of the songs have sophisticated accompaniments. Sometimes the piano doubles the voice, though hardly ever through an entire piece. At other times the piano will play a countermelody to the voice to form a kind of obbligato. Like Debussy, Faith has a fondness for triplets, because of the movement and flow they add to a song. Thomas Nashe's \"Spring, the Sweet Spring\" is an exercise in perpetual motion for the accompanist, with only brief repose at the end of each stanza. This inventive, florid accompaniment, along with Faith's strict use of ABA form, thin texture, and a definite key signature lend a neo-baroque character to this Elizabethan poem. The harmony, however, remains contemporary, with Faith's use of incidental chromatics and added-note chords. Like many composers who rely on modality rather than tonality, Faith rarely uses key signatures. His harmonic idiom displays a changing palette of colors marked by simultaneous cross-relations, the Lydian sharped fourth, and combinations of this sharped fourth and Mixolydian flatted seventh. Faith has denied any desire to pursue more avant-garde idioms. Earlier experiments in progressive styles met with little success, and if anything beyond the romantic exists in Faith's music, it may be the influence of Hindemith which was furthered by his studies at Indiana University with Bernhard Heiden, himself a Hindemith pupil. Traces of this influence can be discerned in the appearance of quartal/quintal harmony in many of the songs. This is seen in \"The Blackbird\" by the Victorian author William Ernest Henley composed in 1955. The accompaniment begins with broken ninth and tenth intervals supported by mildly dissonant chords; it is then followed by a hocket-like passage. This underlying texture continues through the first half of the song, contrasting with legato vocal melody. Faith's use of arch form or \"coming full circle\" reflects the influence of Brahms, whose many songs fall into this structural category. He may end with a literal repeat, a transposed portion, or only a fragment of A, and may repeat text, music, or both in the process. Arch form is also reflected in the use of dynamics. Many songs begin quietly, reach a climax in an interior section, and then end as they began. The composer's selection of poetry brings to the foreground some of literature's most famous writers in works that in this day and age have been unjustly neglected by the general public: Conrad Aiken, Edward Lear, Charles Cotton, and Christina Rossetti, to name a few. In his later years Faith began to set more diverse poets, including Moorish, Islamic and Chinese authors. That Faith is well-read is apparent not only in his choice of fine poetry to set to music, but also in his allusions to literature in many of his instrumental works. In addition, he often selects longer poems than would be considered usual for a song and writes few miniatures. The success of setting a lengthy piece of verse seems to depend upon Faith's ability to delay the listener's climactic expectations by moving through harmonic ambiguity until reaching an emotionally charged section that merits a cadence\u2014usually on open sonorities without the thirds. This event may repeat itself many times with a greater or lesser dynamic level, thereby expanding his music resources. Faith's songs adhere strictly to the rhythm dictated by the text of the poem. In fact, he simultaneously composes both melody and accompaniment by singing the text and playing the keyboard and immediately writing it down. Faith's adherence to the text rhythm results in shifting meters to accommodate phrases of varying length and text-derived rhythmic figures often provide the basis for his accompaniments For subject matter Faith prefers nature imagery over love poetry and until 1994 with his Mother Goose Rhymes, there had been only one comical song\u2014Edward Lear's \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" written in 1960. Many of Faith's settings reflect the nationality of the poet and the time period in which the poem was written. For example, Four Love Songs on Elizabethan lyrics display thin textures, balanced forms, and traditional harmonic progressions, while the Jean de La Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont songs have a French character that reveals Faith's debt to Ravel and Debussy. More recently, Faith's songs on Moorish poetry evoke an exotic, middle eastern quality. In the beautiful setting of Ben Jonson's \"To Celia\" , Faith, by stressing the poem's inherent passion, brings a fresh outlook to a lyric which had become too familiar in arrangements of the old English setting. He achieves this through an operatically conceived vocal line: high and sustained, and encompassing a range of an octave and a fifth. Two works that do not necessarily fall into specific stylistic categories, but deserve mention nonetheless, are Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Music When Soft Voices Die\" and the miniature \"Remember Me\" by the Victorian Christina Rossetti. The spontaneous quality of the Shelley song reveals the poem's great effect on Faith, who, after nearly two years without song writing , produced one of his most frequently performed pieces. The introduction's angular, twisting melody, taken later by the vocal line, lends a troubled, unsettling quality to the lyric. \"Remember Me\" was written in 1954 and is unusual for its brevity. The poet, Christina Rossetti, was an Englishwoman of Italian descent and is best known for her words to the hymns \"In the Bleak Mid-Winter\" and \"Love Came Down at Christmas.\" Faith set three more of her poems which are included in the first published volume of songs by Leyerle Publications. Many of Faith's songs have themes related to the sea, and there are a number of others in which the sea figures as an integral element in the poem. This stems from the composer\"s extreme fascination with water, having been raised near the high banks of the wide Ohio River in Evansville, Indiana. \"Sea Fever\" , one of Faith's few biographically-influenced songs, displays such a depth of emotion rare for a nineteen-year-old. It is an important early song because it established many compositional techniques to which the composer returned throughout his lyrical output. Another \"sea\" example is \"Ships\" an English translation of \"Vaisseaux, nous vous aurons aim\u00e9s\" by Jean de la Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont, the  French World War I poet killed in action in 1914. This poem was also set by Faur\u00e9 in that composer's final song cycle L'horizon chim\u00e9rique. Faith's song is scored for cello obbligato, piano, and female voice. Faith skillfully translates into music the emotions behind the words of the world's greatest authors. Although many of his songs display common characteristics, each reveals an approach that allows the poem's individuality to shine through. Performers of art song, both singers and pianists, will appreciate Faith's output, considering the variety of poems he set to music and the gracious way he treats the voice and piano in his neo-romantic/impressionistic manner. Somewhat reticent of theoretical discussions, however, Faith considers himself only to be a composer of the heart, who relies on his musical gifts to bring joy to others.", "hasanswer": false}]}

During its charting, the single sold 40,489 units, making it her highest selling solo single to date. The single was her first release in a slew of fairy tale themed singles created for her debut studio album, Never+Land. For \"VS\", the overall theme was of Snow White, most notably from The Walt Disney Company's 1937 film adaptation. The music video for the song featured two incarnations of misono, one as the princess Snow White and the other as the Evil Queen. Throughout the video, the Evil Queen would set traps, which Snow White would find and turn against her. The single's coupling track, \"Glass no Kutsu\" also kept in tune with the fairy tale theme, being titled after the glass slipper from the story of Cinderella. Despite the title eluding to a fairy tale, the song itself was about the distance between two lovers, with the \"shoes\" being a euphemism for the distance. The lyrics to \"VS\" were written by misono herself, while the musical arrangement was done by video game composer Takahiro Izutani.

{"id": "639_974", "question": "Who was the composer of Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_50056", "text": "After releasing Clannad, Jun Maeda decided to make a game based on Tomoyo's scenario from Clannad. Maeda handled the game's planning and scenario, and Leo Kashida, a new member of the team, accompanied him. As opposed to Itaru Hinoue who was the character designer and art director for Clannad, Fumio was the art director for Tomoyo After, while Hinoue helped Fumio with the character design. As such, characters who appeared in Clannad such as Tomoya and Tomoyo look similar but visibly different from when in Clannad. Maeda also composed the music for the game along with Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi. When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 , improvements to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after the removal of the adult content consisting of sex scenes. Y\u016bto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on a computer screen. The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain. Release historyTomoyo After was released as an adult game on November 25, 2005 as a limited edition version, playable on Windows PCs as a DVD, and as a bonus came bundled with the visual novel's original soundtrack. The manufacturing of the adult version has since been suspended. An updated all ages version compatible for Windows Vista PCs was released by Key on July 31, 2009 in a box set containing five other Key visual novels called Key 10th Memorial Box; this version contains the additional scenario from the PS2 version, and features full voice acting, including Tomoya. The version of Tomoyo After available in Key 10th Memorial Box was re-released on April 30, 2010 with updated compatibility for Windows 7 PCs under the title Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life Memorial Edition. Key released an updated version titled Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life Perfect Edition on September 26, 2014 for Windows. The Perfect Edition contains the additional content featured in the consumer ports as well as the adult content from the original version. Tomoyo After was released in English on July 1, 2016. The first consumer console port of the game was released for the PS2 on January 25, 2007 by Prototype under the title Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life CS Edition; CS stands for \"consumer software\". An all ages version playable on FOMA mobile phones was released on May 29, 2008 by Prototype through VisualArt's Motto, but did not include the role-playing video game \"Dungeons & Takafumis\". A PlayStation Portable version of the CS Edition, along with full voice acting including Tomoya, was released on March 19, 2009 by Prototype. An Xbox 360 version of the CS Edition was released by Prototype on September 22, 2010. A PlayStation 3 version of the CS Edition was released by Prototype on July 29, 2012 as a limited edition originally sold only at the VisualArt's Daikanshasai event held that day in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of VisualArt's. The PS3 version has subsequently been sold at three other events: at Comiket 83 between December 29\u201331, 2012, at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show between September 21\u201322, and at the Character1 exhibition on May 1, 2016 to raise money for victims of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes, totaling \u00a5272,506.

{"id": "639_975", "question": "Who was the composer of Symphony No. 4?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_21830", "text": "Stylistically, Brian's music could broadly be described as being in a late romantic idiom, exhibiting the influence of Gustav Mahler in his ambitious orchestration and progressive tonality. A Germanophile \u2013 the text of the Psalms in his fourth symphony is sung in German \u2013 Brian's main musical influences are primarily Germanic composers like Wagner, Bruckner, Strauss, Mahler and Bach, as well as Elgar. Brian's music is fundamentally tonal rather than atonal and shows little or no influence of dodecaphony; however, it is often punctuated with violent and occasionally dissonant passages. Brian's music has several recognisable hallmarks: the liking of extreme dotted rhythms, deep brass notes, and various uncharacteristic harp, piano and percussion timbres, and other unusual orchestral sounds and textures. Also typical are moments of stillness, such as the slow harp arpeggio that is heard near the beginning and ending of the Eighth Symphony. Arguably, his music's most notable characteristic however is its restlessness: rarely does one mood persist for long before it is contrasted, often abruptly, with another. Even in Brian's slow movements, lyrical meditation does not often structure the music for long before restless thoughts intrude. Although the fragmentary nature of his music militates against classical thematic unity, he often employs structural blocks of sound, where similar rhythms and thematic material allude to previous passages . However fragmentary Brian's music is, he maintains symphonic cohesion by long-term tonal processes , where the music is aiming towards a key, rather than being in a home key and returning to it. Like Bach and Bruckner, Brian was an organist, and the organ repertoire influenced his musical habits . Other sources of influence are late Victorian street music, and particularly brass and military bands: although he composed little dedicated music for brass band, brass instruments are often prominent in Brian's orchestral music, as are marches. Although he wrote music in a range of forms, Brian's most famous legacy is his cycle of 32 symphonies. His first canonical symphony \u2013 an earlier Fantastic Symphony was withdrawn \u2013 is the colossal Gothic Symphony, a performance of which last almost two hours and requires enormous orchestral and choral forces. It was completed in 1927. Although the Gothic is by far Brian's best-known work, and perhaps the work by which he has come to be defined, it is not representative of his symphonies as a whole. Few of Brian's symphonies call for larger forces than a typical 20th-century symphony orchestra \u2013 although No. 4 calls for a large choir and soprano soloist \u2013 and a typical Brian symphony lasts approximately twenty minutes in performance. Brian usually alludes to the classical four-movement structure of the symphony, even in single-movement works. His sixth symphony was composed at the age of 72, and the majority of Brian's symphonies were composed in rapid succession in the last two decades of his life, in his 80s and even into his 90s. Most were unperformed during Brian's own life, although all thirty-two have since been recorded. In addition to symphonies, Brian also composed several large operas in the 1950s. In 1997, Brian's 1951 opera in eight scenes The Cenci, based on the 1819 play by Percy Bysshe Shelley, was premiered in a concert performance by the Millennium Sinfonia, conducted by James Kelleher, at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "639_976", "question": "Who was the composer of Paris?", "ctxs": [{"id": "97_9246", "text": "In the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouv\u00e8res of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of Fran\u00e7ois I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established. In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and Fran\u00e7ois Couperin. The Conservatoire de Musique de Paris was founded in 1795. By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music. Romantic-era composers include Hector Berlioz , Charles Gounod , Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns , L\u00e9o Delibes and Jules Massenet , among others. Georges Bizet's Carmen premiered 3 March 1875. Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon. Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy , Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel . Several foreign-born composers, such as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin , Franz Liszt , Jacques Offenbach , Niccol\u00f2 Paganini , and Igor Stravinsky , established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris. Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourr\u00e9e to the accompaniment of the cabrette and often the vielle \u00e0 roue in the caf\u00e9s and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement, and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city. Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and caf\u00e9s. Paris is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city. Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s. Immediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, mostly found in cellars because of a lack of space; these included the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll. Some of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the caf\u00e9s of the city at night. Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord. Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine. The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967. On 19 December 2015, Paris and other worldwide fans commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf\u2014a cabaret singer-songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars. Other singers\u2014of similar style\u2014include Maurice Chevalier, Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, as well as Charles Trenet. Paris has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s. The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, it gave a voice, a political and social status for many minorities.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jennifer and Nicky mean business when it comes to getting these couples into shape. They start by putting the couples through an intense workout that draws tears from more than one contestant. While the couples are exercising, we are introduced to each team: Team Fairy Tale is composed of Allison and David. The couple has been engaged since December 2009 and met online. Allison currently weighs 170\u00a0lbs. and David weighs 265\u00a0lbs. Team Fun & Games is composed of Dawn and Adam, a pair of board game lovers who met via a mutual friend on MySpace.

She currently weighs 230\u00a0lbs. and he weighs 367\u00a0lbs. Team Beach Romance is composed of Ginny and Marc. In addition to losing weight, this couple is also giving up smoking together. They met outside one of the comedy clubs that Marc owns when both were taking a smoke break. She weighs 179\u00a0lbs. and he weighs 241\u00a0lbs. After the first grueling workout, the women are taken away for a more fun activity: dress shopping! However, the activity is \"bitter-sweet\" for Lindsey and some of the other girls due to their current weights. The men also spend some time looking at outfits for the big day at a tuxedo shop. This shopping trip serves as motivation for many of the contestants. After everyone tries on their dream wedding gowns and tuxedos, they meet up with Sara Rue, the hostess of the show. Sara tells everyone that their first challenge will be a dancing competition and the winners will get their dream outfits. The couples must maintain a combined heart-rate of 225 beats per minute to start in order to stay in the competition, and each song results in a higher heart-rate requirement. Ginny and Marc are the first couple to be eliminated. After a few more minutes of intense dancing, running, and jumping jacks, all the couples were eliminated, leaving Laeresa and Stephen as the winners. The weigh-in ceremony was very similar to the weigh-ins on The Biggest Loser, however, the two couples who had the lowest percentage of weight loss immediately faced off in an elimination challenge called \"Til Death Do Us Part,\" and that their weights were reported as a combined total, not individually. Sara also revealed that at the end of the season, all of the eliminated contestants would come back and compete for a dream honeymoon vacation. When all was said and done, Dawn and Adam lost the most percentage of weight with a grand total of 7.28% lost. The two couples that ended up in the \"Til Death Do Us Part\" elimination challenge were Ginny and Marc and Lindsey and Chase. The challenge required the couples to not only keep a 200-pound weight off the ground, but bid to see how long they could do it for. Lindsey and Chase won the bid with a time of three minutes and were allowed to stay in the competition. Ginny and Marc were eliminated.", "hasanswer": false}]}
