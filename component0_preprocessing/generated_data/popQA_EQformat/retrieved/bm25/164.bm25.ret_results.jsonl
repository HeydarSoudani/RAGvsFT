Each of the segments depicts simple imagery that has been treated with visual effects, much in the same way as Eno's music is often made up of simple instrumental performances that have been treated with audio effects. The work was filmed on a Thursday afternoon and named as such. Thursday Afternoon consists of multiple tracks of processed piano and electronic textures. The layers of the composition are phased so that their relationships to each other are constantly changing in a way similar to his previous Discreet Music piece. The album was also one of the first to take advantage of the extended running time of the compact disc format, containing only one 60-min track.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Upon learning he lost it to Emma, she declares their partnership ended and tells him she will leave him in the Enchanted Forest, his revenge against Rumpelstiltskin not accomplished. Cora returns to the settlement she destroyed, and uses the hearts of the refugees to reanimate the corpses as servants to do her bidding. Emma shows Aurora a photograph of Henry to confirm that he is the boy she met. Mary Margaret reveals that she, too, has visited the fiery, red room in her sleep, but withheld that information from Aurora to avoid frightening her even more. Mary Margaret realizes that the sleeping curse is the connection, and develops a plan to communicate with Mr. Gold, whom she believes is the only person with the knowledge of how to overpower Cora. Aurora goes back to sleep and explains the whole situation to Henry. The next day, as they travel, Mulan sees that Aurora's arm has been burned. Having promised Prince Phillip that she would protect Aurora, Mulan is reluctant to let Aurora endanger herself for Mary Margaret and Emma's goals; but Aurora insists that every day since she was rescued has been a gift, and that it is right for her to use that gift to help someone else. They make camp so Aurora can sleep in order to meet with Henry again, but the camp is attacked by Cora's corpse army and Aurora is pulled from the netherworld when Mulan must awaken her. Mary Margaret, Emma, and Mulan prevent Cora's servants from taking the compass, but Aurora is abducted. Cora holds Aurora prisoner, revealing that she knew about Aurora's secret ambition to go to Storybrooke with Emma and Snow, but Aurora is defiant even after Cora offers to help recover Philip's soul, explaining that the souls of wraith victims are transported to another realm. Cora is so angered, she knocks Aurora unconscious. She then sends a raven to inform Mary Margaret that Cora will kill Aurora if they fail to bring her the compass by sundown. Mulan wants to make the trade, but Mary Margaret suggests they re-establish contact with Henry in order to overpower Cora; if Mary Margaret were exposed to Mulan's sleeping powder, it should weaken her mental defenses enough to cause her to visit the netherworld. However, Mulan is out of powder, so they travel to the Woods of the Dead to find a poppy, from which Mulan produces more powder. Emma expresses her regret that she failed to prevent Henry from falling under the sleeping curse, but Mary Margaret points out that she could have prevented Regina's curse in the first place and there is nothing to gain from finding ways to blame themselves; Emma affirms that she blames Regina. Mulan uses the sleeping powder on Mary Margaret who meets with David in the netherworld. She awakens and explains David's plight, but Emma confidently reassures her that they will get back to Storybrooke and that Mary Margaret will free David from this new curse; she has faith in them. Mary Margaret tells Emma that they need to travel to Rumpelstiltskin's cell, but then they realize that Mulan has left with the compass to make Cora's trade. Meanwhile, Hook releases Aurora and asks her to tell Emma that his offer still stands; he will help them get the magical ashes in exchange for passage with them. Aurora finds the others just after Snow and Emma have overtaken Mulan, and it seems that Snow is prepared to kill Mulan to prevent her from going to Cora. Aurora breaks up the fight and explains that Hook released her in order to prove he can be trusted and\u2014she suspects\u2014because he has feelings for Emma.

During the story development process, several elements of the original novel were dropped or changed. The game was developed by Wolf Team, an independent game development studio founded in 1986. Due to bad experiences at Telenet Japan, the previous employer of multiple Wolf Team members, the staff sought an independent publisher for the game. After an unsuccessful pitch to Enix, they entered a publishing contract with Bandai Namco . Phantasia had a troubled development cycle for the original Super Famicom version, with many creative disagreements between Wolf Team and Namco. The disagreements led to most of the Wolf Team staff leaving after the game in order to start a new company, tri-Ace, which would go on to make the Star Ocean series. Remaining members would continue to develop games in the Tales series. The studio remained independent until 2003, when it was acquired by Bandai Namco and renamed Namco Tales Studio. The studio's shares were divided between Bandai Namco, Telenet Japan and series director Eiji Kikuchi. In 2006, Namco bought Telenet's shares, then later Kikuchi's, giving them full control over the studio.

Panzer Korps General Helmut Kladen is dispatched to the Swiss frontier with top secret documents to be used as a bargaining chip with the Allies to save Germany from the Soviets. He is subsequently intercepted by the U.S. Army and turned over to Army Intelligence. In contemporary Los Angeles, Lt. Barney Caine is assigned to solve the murder of his former boss and friend Tom Neeley, which presumably occurred during a drug deal gone wrong. However, Neeley has written \"Gene\" on a newspaper in his own blood, and Caine finds a map of Germany with the name \"Obermann\" on it. Caine is surprised to learn that Neeley provided drugs at parties hosted by the tycoon Adam Steiffel . When he interviews Neeley's ex-wife , he quickly catches her in several lies, and when he returns to interview her a second time, he finds her shot dead in her hot tub. Steiffel reveals in his interview that Neeley was working for him as a bagman. Neeley was sent overseas by the company to deliver money to business partners. Caine becomes convinced he must go to Germany to solve Neeley's murder, he convinces his Chief to allow him to go to Germany to continue the investigation. Later, the Chief is seen phoning one of Steiffel's cronies to tell him that Caine has taken the bait. Once in Berlin, Caine meets Paul Obermann at the Berlin Zoo. Obermann explains operation \"Genesis\" - a synthetic fuel formula that the Nazis had produced . This confirms Caine's hunch that Neeley was killed over Genesis. Obermann is then murdered outside the zoo. At his apartment, his niece Lisa shows up to be interviewed by the police. At Obermann's memorial service, Caine asks Lisa to accompany him to act as his interpreter. Lisa agrees and they follow up on a lead that Obermann gave him regarding Professor Siebold who worked on the formula. During their interview with Siebold , he reveals that the inventor of the formula, Dr. Abraham Esau , is still alive. After they leave his apartment, Siebold is shot in the head through a window. When they meet up with Esau, he writes down the formula for Caine, after he makes Caine promise to make it public. Lisa and Caine make photocopies and send them to the LAPD and a Swiss energy company. Caine also hides two copies from Lisa, depositing them in the hotel's safe. Subsequently, he reveals that he has deduced that she is not Obermann's niece at all, but a spy sent to keep tabs on him. Lisa admits it, but claims she didn't sleep with him because of her orders. At the border with East Berlin, Caine confronts Tadesco who relates how he knew Neeley, and what transpired after his capture by the Americans. As Tadesco walks towards his car, Lisa kills Tadesco, then walks towards East Berlin. At the airport before flying home to Los Angeles, Caine realizes the two copies of the formula in the hotel safe were replaced with fakes by Lisa, and that the only real copies are with the LAPD and the Swiss. After landing in Los Angeles, he heads straight to Steiffel's office. Steiffel has kidnapped Caine's partner and is holding him to exchange for the copy of the formula. After exchanging the formula for Yosuta's release, Caine demands answers from Steiffel. Steiffel then outlines the cartel's plan since the end of the war, to keep the formula secret. They had been able to keep it secret until Swiss businessman, Tauber, began searching for the members of the original Genesis team, in the hope the team could recreate the formula.  Tauber's actions made the members of the Genesis team a liability to the cartel, so Steiffel had pulled strings to get Caine sent on a trip to Germany, which would serve as a cover for the cartel's plot to eliminate the remaining members. Just before leaving, Caine reveals that he sent the formula to Tauber. After their meeting, Steiffel makes a phone call to Tauber, asking him to keep the formula secret for another 10 years in exchange for a 25% share of his anthracite holdings.

Toho's interpretation differed greatly from the original in size and abilities. Among kaiju, King Kong was suggested to be among the most powerful in terms of raw physical force, possessing strength and durability that rivaled that of Godzilla. As one of the few mammal-based kaiju, Kong's most distinctive feature was his intelligence. He demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to an opponent's fighting style, identify and exploit weaknesses in an enemy, and utilize his environment to stage ambushes and traps. In King Kong vs. Godzilla, Kong was scaled to be  tall. This version of Kong was given the ability to harvest electricity as a weapon and draw strength from electrical voltage. In King Kong Escapes, Kong was scaled to be  tall. This version was more similar to the original, where he relied on strength and intelligence to fight and survive. Rather than residing on Skull Island, Toho's version of Kong resided on Faro Island in King Kong vs. Godzilla and on Mondo Island in King Kong Escapes. In 1966, Toho planned to produce Operation Robinson Crusoe: King Kong vs. Ebirah as a co-production with Rankin/Bass Productions, however Ishir\u014d Honda was unavailable at the time to direct the film and, as a result, Rankin/Bass backed out of the project, along with the King Kong license. Toho still proceeded with the production, replacing King Kong with Godzilla at the last minute and shot the film as Ebirah, Horror of the Deep. Elements of King Kong's character remained in the film, reflected in Godzilla's uncharacteristic behavior and attraction to the female character Daiyo. Toho and Rankin/Bass later negotiated their differences and co-produced King Kong Escapes in 1967, loosely based on Rankin/Bass' animated show. Toho Studios wanted to remake King Kong vs. Godzilla, which was the most successful of the entire Godzilla series of films, in 1991 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film, as well as to celebrate Godzilla's upcoming 40th anniversary. However, they were unable to obtain the rights to use Kong, and initially intended to use Mechani-Kong as Godzilla's next adversary. But it was soon learned that even using a mechanical creature who resembled Kong would be just as problematic legally and financially for them. As a result, the film became Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, with one last failed attempt made to use Kong in 2004's Godzilla: Final Wars.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The game has similar gameplay to earlier games in the Super Mario seriesSuper Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros.\u00a02, and Super Mario Bros.\u00a03but introduces new elements. As well as dashing and jumping, the player can also fly or float with the aid of the Cape Feather and P-Balloon and can execute the new Spin Jump move. The game has 96 level exits in total. The player navigates through the game via two game screens: an overworld map and a side-scrolling course. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, ghost houses, castles, and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the world's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or castle allows access to that course. The majority of the game takes place in these linear levels, populated with obstacles and enemies, which involves the player traversing the stage by dashing, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if Mario comes into contact with an enemy while Small Mario, falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or runs out of time. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player can continue from the most recent save point by selecting \"Continue\". Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; each of the seven worlds features fortresses controlled by one of the Koopalings, and the player also battles Bowser in his castle in the seventh and final world. Super Mario World includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the second player controls his brother, Luigi. In addition to the power-ups from previous games, such as the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, Super Mario World has a new power-up named the Cape Feather, which gives Mario a cape and the ability to fly, glide in the air, and use the cape as a sail. The game also introduces the ability to \"store\" an extra power-up in a box at the top centre of the screen. For example, if the player obtains a Fire Flower or a Cape Feather, then a Super Mushroom will appear in the box. If Mario gets hit by an enemy, the stored item in the box will automatically drop. Alternatively, the player can manually release the stored item at any time. The game introduces Yoshi, a dinosaur companion Mario can ride who is able to eat most enemies. If Yoshi attempts to eat a Koopa or its shell, he can spit it out and fire it at enemies. If the player fails to spit the shell out within a certain amount of time, Yoshi will swallow it, rendering it useless. When holding any Koopa shell in his mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes him to emit dust clouds that defeat nearby enemies, and a red shell allows him to produce three fireballs that defeat enemies. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also has hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding it five enemies or one star, Super Mushroom, Fire Flower or Cape Feather, causing the baby Yoshi to mature. Although the main objective is to navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access a hidden world, the player needs to find keys scattered throughout the game's levels. When a key is found, it must be brought to a keyhole to unlock either a new level or a Star Road. Exploring these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently changes some of the enemies' sprites and alters the overworld map's colour scheme.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The creators of the comic exercised their right to go elsewhere, but this required approval from all divisions of Warner Bros., including television, before it could be approved. After several years, in 2008, Noveck was allowed to take the project to Mark Vahradian at Di Bonaventura Productions. Unusually, this made it the first film from DC not produced by Warner Bros., after the purchase. In June 2008, Summit Entertainment announced plans to adapt Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner's Red. Red was adapted for the big screen by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber, who also wrote the adaptations of Whiteout and Alice. The project was produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura . By April 2009, Bruce Willis was reportedly in discussions with Summit to take the starring role of Frank Moses. It was reported in July 2009 that Morgan Freeman was in talks to co-star alongside Willis in the film. Also in July 2009, Robert Schwentke, the director of The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan, was in negotiations to direct Red. In August 2009, Schwentke confirmed to MTV News that he was on board. He stated that he loved the script, but differences existed between the comic and the movie, stating; \"It's very funny, which the comic book isn't ... It's not as violent as the comic book,\" and  \"The script that I've read is obviously different from the comic, because I don't think the comic gives you enough for a two-hour movie.\" In November 2009, Helen Mirren was reported to be engaged to work alongside Freeman and Willis in the film. Also in November 2009, John C. Reilly and Mary-Louise Parker were in negotiations to join the cast. Reilly would play a retired CIA agent who is paranoid that everyone is out to kill him. Parker would play the romantic interest, a federal pension worker who becomes embroiled in the Willis character's struggle to stay alive. In the same month, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss, and Brian Cox entered negotiations to join the cast. In December 2009, creator Warren Ellis stated on his mailing list: \"Read the RED script. Not bad. Not the book, but not bad. Funny. Especially when you know the casting. Very tight piece of work. Talked to the producers last week. They're all kind of giddy over the casting coups.

My Family was consciously designed to have wide appeal, with characters viewers could build a relationship with in the same way as previous BBC sitcom 2point4 Children which focuses around a similar family unit. The show chronicles the lives of the Harpers, a fictional middle-class British family who live at 78 Lancaster Road, Chiswick, London. Dentist Ben and his wife Susan, a tour guide who later works for an art gallery, have three children: Nick, Janey, and Michael, who endanger their lives. Susan is a control freak, but Ben prefers to leave the children to it and stay as uninvolved as possible. Janey later goes to University, but drops out and moves back in later, while Nick finally gets his own place. Mainly focusing on Ben and Susan, the show featured sub-stories ranging from Nick's schemes to Abi and Roger's love life. It is described as a \"dysfunctional family\"-style sitcom; however, many of the episodes feature the family working together to get one another out of trouble. Nick's bizarre jobs became a major feature of the first four series. After the departure of Nick then more prominence was given to Abi and Roger's love life, Michael's misadventures, Janey's endless list of boyfriends, and Alfie's dream of musical stardom. The show saw considerable development and change in its characters' lives, seeing Janey turn from teenage rebel to loving mother, Nick turn from slacker to a mature adult, Abi marry Roger, and Michael go through and beyond his school days.

Queen Victoria had expressed her wish that her children should marry for love, but this did not mean that her choice of suitors would necessarily be extended to anybody outside the royal houses of Europe. Raising a British subject to royalty, however high their rank, was politically objectionable, and also wasted any opportunity for a useful foreign alliance. The Queen instructed her daughter Victoria, recently married to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, to produce a list of eligible princes in Europe. Her search produced only two suitable candidates: the Prince of Orange; and Prince Albert of Prussia, cousin to Victoria's husband Frederick William. The Prince of Orange was soon discounted. He journeyed to Windsor Castle so that Queen Victoria could look him over in person, but he proved unpalatable to Alice. The prince too showed little interest in Alice, despite strong pressure from his pro-British mother, Queen Sophie of the Netherlands. Prince Albert, too, was spurned, with Prince Frederick William remarking that his cousin would not do for \"one who deserves the very best\". With both of the leading candidates now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of Hesse, a minor German royal, the nephew of the Grand Duke of Hesse. Princess Victoria had gone to the court of Hesse to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with Louis and his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they could watch the Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law.

The situation in the tea industry was described as critical, with farming under the organic program being described as 10x more expensive and producing half of the yield by the farmers. In September 2021 the government announced \"economic emergency\", as the situation was further aggravated by falling national currency exchange rate, inflation rising as a result of high food prices, and pandemic restrictions in tourism which further decreased country's income. Sri Lanka wants to transition to 100% biological agriculture; the trade in chemical fertilizers and pesticides has been banned. The government cancelled some of these measures, but importing urea remains banned. In November 2021, Sri Lanka abandoned its plan to become the world's first organic farming nation following rising food prices and weeks of protests against the plan. As of December 2021, the damage to agricultural production was already done, with prices having risen substantially for vegetables in Sri Lanka, and time needed to recover from the crisis.

He examines it frequently while at his desk, and after finding Audrey's corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it. The image is repeated at the end of the film, when he meets an identical-looking woman at an identical-looking beach, who strikes an identical pose. After complimenting her beauty, he asks her: \"Are you in pictures?\" She blushes and replies: \"Don't be silly.\" The Coens decided early in the writing process to include the picture as a key element in the room. \"Our intention,\" Joel explained later, \"was that the room would have very little decoration, that the walls would be bare and that the windows would offer no view of any particular interest. In fact, we wanted the only opening on the exterior world to be this picture. It seemed important to us to create a feeling of isolation.\" Later in the film, Barton places into the frame a small picture of Charlie, dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase. The juxtaposition of his neighbor in the uniform of an insurance salesman and the escapist image of the woman on the beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for Barton. Critic Michael Dunne notes: \"[V]iewers can only wonder how 'real' Charlie is.\u00a0... In the film's final shot\u00a0... viewers must wonder how 'real' [the woman] is. The question leads to others: How real is Fink? Lipnick? Audrey? Mayhew? How real are films anyway?\" The picture's significance has been the subject of broad speculation. The Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene \"feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up coda\". In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell suggests that Barton's fixation on the picture is ironic, considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture . She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the camera moves past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself\u00a0\u2013  in a sense\u00a0\u2013  inside the picture. Critic M. Keith Booker calls the final scene an \"enigmatic comment on representation and the relationship between art and reality\". He suggests that the identical images point to the absurdity of art which reflects life directly. The film transposes the woman directly from art to reality, prompting confusion in the viewer; Booker asserts that such a literal depiction therefore leads inevitably to uncertainty. Many critics noted that \"The Law of Non-Contradiction\", an episode of the Coen-produced TV series Fargo based on their eponymous 1996 film, features a reference to the picture, as the episode's main character Gloria sits at the beach in shot and position similar to the picture's.

Namibia faces a non-communicable disease burden. The Demographic and Health Survey summarises findings on elevated blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity: Among eligible respondents age 35\u201364, more than 4 in 10 women and men have elevated blood pressure or are currently taking medicine to lower their blood pressure. Forty-nine percent of women and 61 percent of men are not aware that they have elevated blood pressure. Forty-three percent of women and 34 percent of men with hypertension are taking medication for their condition. Only 29 percent of women and 20 percent of men with hypertension are taking medication and have their blood pressure under control. Six percent of women and 7 percent of men are diabetic; that is, they have elevated fasting plasma glucose values or report that they are taking diabetes medication. An additional 7 percent of women and 6 percent of men are prediabetic. Sixty-seven percent of women and 74 percent of men with diabetes are taking medication to lower their blood glucose. Women and men with a higher-than-normal body mass index are more likely to have elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting blood glucose. The HIV epidemic remains a public health issue in Namibia despite significant achievements made by the Ministry of Health and Social Services to expand HIV treatment services. In 2001, there were an estimated 210,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, and the estimated death toll in 2003 was 16,000. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, the epidemic in Namibia \"appears to be leveling off.\" As the HIV/AIDS epidemic has reduced the working-aged population, the number of orphans has increased. It falls to the government to provide education, food, shelter and clothing for these orphans. A Demographic and Health Survey with an HIV biomarker was completed in 2013 and served as the fourth comprehensive, national-level population and health survey conducted in Namibia as part of the global Demographic and Health Surveys programme. The DHS observed important characteristics associated to the HIV epidemic: Overall, 26 percent of men age 15\u201349 and 32 percent of those age 50\u201364 have been circumcised.\u00a0HIV prevalence for men age 15\u201349 is lower among circumcised than among uncircumcised men . The pattern of lower HIV prevalence among circumcised than uncircumcised men is observed across most background characteristics. For each age group, circumcised men have lower HIV prevalence than those who are not circumcised; the difference is especially pronounced for men age 35\u201339 and 45\u201349 . The difference in HIV prevalence between uncircumcised and circumcised men is larger among urban than rural men . HIV prevalence among respondents age 15\u201349 is 16.9 percent for women and 10.9 percent for men. HIV prevalence rates among women and men age 50\u201364 are similar . HIV prevalence peaks in the 35\u201339 age group for both women and men . It is lowest among respondents age 15\u201324 . Among respondents age 15\u201349, HIV prevalence is highest for women and men in Zambezi and lowest for women in Omaheke and men in Ohangwena . In 76.4 percent of the 1,007 cohabiting couples who were tested for HIV in the 2013 NDHS, both partners were HIV negative; in 10.1 percent of the couples, both partners were HIV positive; and 13.5 percent of the couples were discordant .

Sixty-six of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. With the escapees' situation kept secret, the U.S. State Department begins to explore options for exfiltrating them from Iran. Tony Mendez, a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency exfiltration specialist, is brought in for a consultation. He criticizes the proposals but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees: that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film. Mendez contacts John Chambers, a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo, a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of Star Wars, to lend the cover story credibility. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and realize that some personnel are unaccounted for. Posing as a producer for Argo, Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with Canadian passports and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendez's scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd. Mendez is told the operation has been cancelled in favor of planned military rescue of the hostages. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack O'Donnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and rebook their cancelled tickets on a Swissair flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' new ticket reservations are only confirmed at the last minute, and the head guard's call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. They board the plane and at about the same time, the airport authorities are alerted to the ruse. They try to stop them but the plane is able to take off. To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed, and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador . The ambassador's Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to Iraq. Mendez is awarded the Intelligence Star, but due to the mission's classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterward. The award is restored to him after the Canadian Caper is declassified in 1997. As the credits roll, President Jimmy Carter is heard commenting on the operation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They reveal themselves on the roof of the United Nations building in New York City, appearing human, but requiring special glasses to protect their eyes and having a distinctive resonance to their voices. Referred to as the Visitors, they reach out in friendship, ostensibly seeking the help of humans to obtain chemicals and minerals needed to aid their ailing world, which is revealed to be a planet orbiting the star Sirius. In return, the Visitors promise to share their advanced technology with humanity. The governments of Earth accept the arrangement, and the Visitors, commanded by their leader John and his deputy Diana, begin to gain considerable influence with human authorities. Strange events begin to occur. Scientists in particular become the objects of increasing media and public hostility. They experience government restrictions on their activities and movements. Others, particularly those keen on examining the Visitors more closely, begin to disappear or are discredited. Noted scientists confess to subversive activities; some of them exhibit other unusual behaviors, such as suddenly demonstrating hand preference opposite to the one they were known to have. Television journalist cameraman Michael Donovan covertly boards one of the Visitors' motherships. Donovan discovers that beneath their human-like fa\u00e7ade\u2014a thin, synthetic skin and human-eye contact lenses\u2014the aliens are carnivorous reptilian humanoids with horned foreheads and green, scaly skin. He also witnesses them eating whole live animals such as rodents and birds. Donovan, who first took footage of one of the alien ships flying overhead while on duty in El Salvador, records some of his findings on videotape and escapes from the mothership with the evidence. However, just as the expos\u00e9 is about to air on television, the broadcast is interrupted by the Visitors, who have taken control of the media. Their announcement makes Donovan and his close friend and assistant Tony fugitives pursued by both the police and the Visitors. Scientists around the world continue to be persecuted, both to discredit them and to distract the rest of the population with a scapegoat to whom they can attribute their fears. Key human individuals are subjected to Diana's special mind-control process called \"conversion\", which turns them into the Visitors' pawns, leaving only subtle behavioral clues to this manipulation. Others become subjects of Diana's horrifying biological experiments. Some humans willingly collaborate with the Visitors, seduced by their power. Daniel Bernstein, a grandson of a Jewish Holocaust survivor, joins the Visitor Youth and reveals the location of a scientist family, his neighbors the Maxwells, to the alien cause. One teenager, Robin Maxwell, the daughter of a well-known scientist who went into hiding, has a sexual relationship with a male Visitor named Brian, who impregnates her as one of Diana's \"medical experiments\". A resistance movement is formed, determined to expose and oppose the Visitors. The Los Angeles cell leader is Julie Parrish, a biologist. Donovan later joins the group, and again sneaking aboard a mothership in search of Tony, who was captured, he learns from a Visitor named Martin that the story about the Visitors needing waste chemicals is a cover for a darker mission. The true purpose of the Visitors' arrival on Earth was to conquer and subdue the planet, steal all of the Earth's water, and harvest the human race as food, leaving only a few as slaves and cannon fodder for the Visitors' wars with other alien races. Martin is one of many dissidents among the Visitors who oppose their leader's plans and would rather co-exist peacefully with the humans. Martin then reveals to Donovan that Tony is dead, a victim of Diana's monstrous experiments. Afterwards, he befriends Donovan and promises to aid the Resistance. He gives Donovan access to one of their sky-fighter ships, which he quickly learns how to pilot. He escapes from the mothership along with Robin and another prisoner named Sancho, who had aided Robin's family in their flight out of occupied Los Angeles. The Resistance strikes its first blows against the Visitors, procuring laboratory equipment and modern military weapons from National Guard armories to carry on the fight. The symbol of the resistance is a blood-red letter V , spray-painted over posters promoting Visitor friendship among humans. The symbol was inspired by Daniel Bernstein's grandfather Abraham, a Holocaust survivor. The miniseries ends with the Visitors now virtually controlling the Earth, and Julie and Elias sending a transmission into space to ask other alien races for help in defeating the occupiers.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Dragging himself from the pit, he takes a sample to an assay office and receives a silver and gold claim. In 1902, he discovers oil near Los Angeles and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, H.W., becomes his nominal business partner, allowing Daniel to present himself to potential investors as a family man. In 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel visits the Sundays' property and meets Paul's identical twin brother Eli, who is a local preacher. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price under the ruse of using it to hunt quail, but his motives are questioned by Eli who knows the land has drilling potential. In exchange for the rights to the property, Eli demands $10,000 for his church. An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout, William Bandy, after he neglected to negotiate with him. Eli requests to bless the well prior to drilling, to which Daniel initially agrees, but denies him when the time arises. Oil drilling commences and a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a gas blowout deafens H.W. and destroys the drilling infrastructure. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for trusting Daniel. A man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires him and the two grow close. A jealous H.W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. Daniel sends H.W. away to a school for the deaf in San Francisco. A representative from Standard Oil offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but, after a perceived slight, Daniel refuses and strikes a deal with Union Oil to build a pipeline to the California coast. However, Bandy's ranch remains an impediment. Reminiscing about their childhood home, Daniel becomes suspicious of Henry's story and confronts him one night at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of tuberculosis, and that he impersonated Henry in hopes of gaining employment with Daniel. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body. Daniel drinks heavily and weeps. The next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel's crime and wants Daniel to publicly repent in Eli's church in exchange for the pipeline easement on his land. As part of his baptism, Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his son. Some time later, as the pipeline is under construction, H.W. is reunited with Daniel, and Eli leaves Little Boston for missionary work. In 1927, H.W. marries Mary Sunday, the younger sister of Paul and Eli. He visits Daniel, who is now a wealthy, alcoholic recluse living in a large mansion. Through a sign language interpreter, H.W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own independent drilling company in Mexico. Daniel reacts angrily and mocks H.W.'s deafness before revealing his true origins as a \"bastard from a basket\". H.W. tells Daniel he is glad that they are not related and walks out; Daniel continues to jeer at H.W. as he departs. Daniel is subsequently visited by Eli while drunk in the private bowling alley in his mansion. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel the property rights to the Bandy ranch, as William Bandy has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounces his faith and his own credibility. Eli acquiesces, only for Daniel to coldly reveal that the property is now worthless because Daniel's neighboring wells have already tapped and drained the same oil reservoir. Desperate, Eli confesses to losing money in the dire financial straits and to having strayed morally.

{"id": "164_42", "question": "Who was the producer of Volcano?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_39931", "text": "\"Volcano\" was written and directed by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode was inspired by volcano-related Hollywood disaster films, such as Dante's Peak and Volcano , which came out around the time they were writing the script; Parker and Stone considered the films two of the worst ever made. Stone said, \"If you watch this episode and then go watch Volcano, this makes more sense than Volcano does.\" Debbie Liebling, who served as a South Park producer at the time of the episode's broadcast, said the volcano erupting in South Park helped establish the setting as a place where \"anything can happen\". Although Stone and Parker acknowledged that a volcano could not actually erupt in this Colorado town, they felt they were entitled to create the episode anyway because the Volcano film was set in Los Angeles; Stone said, \"If they could do it, we could.\" Similarly, the duo acknowledge the tunnel built in the episode would not really divert the lava, but they included it because Parker said, \"Any movie today, that's basically how dumb they are.\" Another influence on the plot was the amount of hunting Parker and Stone saw around them while growing up in Colorado. Neither of them were hunters, and Parker said Stan's hesitation about hunting was based largely on himself and his father, who hated the idea of killing an animal even though Parker's grandfather, like Jimbo, was enthusiastic about the sport. Parker said he feels many of the first-season episodes considered taboo in 1997 would have been considered less controversial five years later, but that \"Volcano\" is an exception. Since the episode involved children drinking beer and threatening each other at gunpoint during hunting trips, Parker said he did not believe Comedy Central would have aired it following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. Parker said, \"Back then, it was just sort of funny, kids pointing guns at each other, and it's just not so funny now.\" South Park animators spent the first four episodes of the show trying to perfect the animation of the characters. By \"Volcano\" \u2013 which was produced after \"Weight Gain 4000\" \u2013, Parker and Stone felt the textures were improved, as well as smaller details like the lines around the eyes of the characters. While the series pilot \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\" was animated with construction paper, subsequent episodes were made using computers. Nevertheless, Parker and Stone wanted the show to maintain its crude paper look; for example, they specifically asked for the night sky in this episode to look like a black piece of paper with holes cut into it for stars, just as it was in the pilot episode. Stone and Parker were especially proud of the animation of the lava, which they said took hours to perfect, although they acknowledged it ended up simply resembling orange construction paper. The lava ball shooting out of the volcano and almost killing Kenny was directly inspired by the Volcano film. Parker and Stone came up with the character of Scuzzlebutt during a random conversation with Comedy Central executive Debbie Liebling. While meeting with her, they simply started drawing the character, and decided to add a celery hand and Patrick Duffy leg for no particular reason. Scuzzlebutt also appeared in a second episode, \"City on the Edge of Forever\" from the second season. Scuzzlebutt turning out to be a real character rather than a ridiculous story was the first instance of a common characteristic of the Cartman character, in which Cartman says outrageous and completely unrealistic things that turn out to be true. Stone commented, \"He's right more often than he's wrong.\" The \"Volcano\" episode was in production when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did not object to most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an \"Indian Fire Trick\", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized \"Volcano\" was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song \"Kumbaya\" around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption. In addition to Scuzzlebutt, \"Volcano\" included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified only as the South Park geologist, and it is only in the episode \"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig\" that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano\u2014calmly sipping his coffee\u2014is \"about how my dad would react to anything\". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation. \"Volcano\" was released alongside five other episodes in a three-VHS set on May 5, 1998, marking the first time South Park was made available on video. The episode was released on the \"Volume I\" video along with \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\"; other featured episodes included \"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig\", \"Death\", \"Weight Gain 4000\", and \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\". \"South Park: The Complete First Season\", a DVD box set featuring all thirteen episodes, including \"Volcano\", was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but the tracks were not included on the DVDs due to \"standards\" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released on a separate CD.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Historians, including Justin Bengry of Birkbeck University of London and Matt Houlbrook of the University of Birmingham, argued that such a pardon would be \"bad history\" despite its political appeal, because of the broad variety of cases in which the historical laws were applied and the distortion of history resulting from an attempt to clean up the wrongdoings of the past post facto. Bengry also cites the existing ability of those convicted under repealed anti-homosexuality laws to have their convictions declared spent.

In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who\u00a0\u2013 The Ultimate Adventure. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor. A pilot episode for a potential spinoff series, K-9 and Company, was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series. Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced. Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood , set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, Dreamland, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official Doctor Who website in 2009. Class, featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness. Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show's first episode. The series was picked up by BBC America on 8 January 2016 and by BBC One a day later. On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled.

Keaton used numerous elements seen in the film, including \"the wedding, the Model T and the use of the pages from a daily calendar to show the house being built in one week\" in his comic parody. Years later, Keaton told an interviewer that the film's title is a play on Three Weeks, a notorious 1907 sex novel by Elinor Glyn. Keaton reportedly joked that it was \"one-third as scandalous\". Knopf notes that One Week is Keaton's first attempt to move away from a plot-driven narrative, as he employed in his earlier film The High Sign, toward mining more and more gags from a few basic elements\u2014in this case, the house and ladders. According to Kevin Brownlow, One Week \"set the style for all the future Keatons; the opening gag sequence ... the slow build-up ... the frenetic climax ... and then that climax outmatched by the final sequence\". Furthermore, the film lay the basis for the cinematic techniques of his future films: \"The simple setups, the flat comedy lighting, the spare use of titles\u2014and the overall excellence of the direction\". According to Eleanor Keaton, Buster originally thought to combine two of his two-reel films, One Week and The Boat , into a four-reeler charting a young couple's adventures.

The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny , his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa and his conflicted best friend Mark . A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so-called due to its events taking place entirely in a single room. A number of publications have labeled The Room as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe The Room as \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies.\" Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters, The Room quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off-kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast. The Disaster Artist, Sestero's memoir of the making of The Room, was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013. A film of the same title based on the book, directed by and starring James Franco, was released on December 1, 2017; the book and film received widespread acclaim and numerous award nominations.

Moritz's company Original Film; the purchase occurred as the Koren-and-O'Keefe-penned Bruce Almighty had grossed $236 million domestically in its two month run. Click was the second comedy Moritz produced for Columbia Pictures, after Not Another Teen Movie . Although Sony planned filming to begin in April 2004 after Sandler finished shooting Spanglish , that was postponed for Karen and O'Keefe to rewrite the script under the supervision of Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella, who was also planned to direct the film as announced by Variety on May 12, 2004. However, he was replaced by Frank Coraci, who previously directed Sandler vehicles The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy , in March 2005. Executive producer Tim Herlihy was also enacted several script revisions. Christopher Walken joined the cast on February 23, 2005. Imageworks began working on the digital effects for Click in January 2006 without any research and development. While most of the effects were shot compositings, three-dimensional graphics were also made for the display on the remote and matte painting a few settings, such as the Bed and Beyond warehouse, a city background at Michael's workplace, and the winter backyard at his home; programs such as Cinema 4D and Autodesk Maya were used to produce the graphics. In order to make the fast-forwarding and rewinding look DVD-like, effects of interlaced video and scan lines \"slicing through\" were added. Motion control photography and green screen effects were used for scenes where Michael looked back on his life with the remote, meaning that were occasionally two Michaels in the same shot; while rotoscoping was used for the sequence where he changes the color of his face with the remote. When it came to scenes where Michael pauses his surroundings, the effects crew originally planned for everything to be frozen, including the environment; however, they found out this \"bothered\" the eye, thus switching the plan to only the characters being frozen while the environment keeps in motion. The primary challenge for the freeze shots was sharpening the frozen characters as much as possible; there were some cases where the characters would freeze in a very active moment, causing the effects team to have to work with the motion blur that resulted from it. For instances where characters were frozen in a moment where they were still, they were filmed staying in that position for seconds so that, during post-production, the average of multiple frames would create a result absent of film grain.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In October, Gil Schwartz, the chief spokesman for CBS, who is depicted in the film, said \"It's astounding how little truth there is in Truth. There are, in fact, too many distortions, evasions and baseless conspiracy theories to enumerate them all. The film tries to turn gross errors of journalism and judgment into acts of heroism and martyrdom.\" Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News at the time of the incidents and depicted in the film, said he had not seen the film, but knew its story and was outraged at its portrayals, adding that \"only Hollywood could come up with that.\" CBS refused to advertise the film because of the movie's \"inaccuracies and distortions\" which would offend CBS News employees. Some at CBS News are \"angered\" with the film's implication that news executives were pressured to revoke the story by corporate owner Viacom, which \"had business reasons to maintain friendly relations with the Bush administration.\" In a statement, the film's producers stated, \"Although we understand CBS wants to put this episode behind them, it's disappointing that they seem to be so concerned about our film \u2026 The events depicted in Truth are still vigorously debated, and that's a good thing\". Brad Fischer, one of the producers, said that a negative response from CBS was not unexpected, but what was surprising is the \"tone and the emotional nature\" of the response. He said that the filmmakers were \"attracted by the intersection of news, politics and business and the story's status as one of the first to be undone by an Internet outcry\" and that he hopes people \"talk about the issues and ask the questions themselves...I don't think it's our job as filmmakers to draw a conclusion, but rather to pose the questions.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_67", "question": "Who was the producer of The Confession?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_5452", "text": "Calvin's first published work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published at his own expense in 1532, it showed that he was a humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg. Calvin produced commentaries on most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then turned his attention to the general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels . For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel. Calvin also wrote many letters and treatises. Following the Responsio ad Sadoletum, Calvin wrote an open letter at the request of Bucer to Charles V in 1543, Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem, defending the reformed faith. This was followed by an open letter to the pope in 1544, in which Calvin admonished Paul III for depriving the reformers of any prospect of rapprochement. The pope proceeded to open the Council of Trent, which resulted in decrees against the reformers. Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto in 1547. When Charles tried to find a compromise solution with the Augsburg Interim, Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond. He wrote the treatise, Vera Christianae pacificationis et Ecclesiae reformandae ratio in 1549, in which he described the doctrines that should be upheld, including justification by faith. Calvin provided many of the foundational documents for reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Upon hearing this, Commodus murders his father. Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor, asking Maximus for his loyalty, but the latter refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and rides for his home near Trujillo, where he finds  his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them, then collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him, and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo. Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to win his freedom. When Commodus organizes 150 days of games to commemorate his father's death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to show himself and give his name; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are held back from striking them down. Maximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator, Tigris of Gaul. Commodus has arranged for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel; Maximus, however, prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; he is called \"Maximus the Merciful\" by the crowd. Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but the latter turns and walks away. Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla, Commodus's sister; and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed. In an effort to win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus, whom the now disloyal Praetorian Guard refuse to aid. Commodus produces a hidden knife, but Maximus drives the knife into Commodus's throat, killing him. Maximus succumbs to his wounds. Before he dies, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated.

{"id": "164_84", "question": "Who was the producer of The Accused?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24426", "text": "The musical Chicago is based on a play of the same name by reporter and playwright Maurine Dallas Watkins, who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner for the Chicago Tribune.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the jazz age, and a long string of acquittals by Cook County juries of female murderers . A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The Chicago Tribune generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the Hearst papers were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants. Regardless of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities. Annan, the model for the character of Roxie Hart, was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924, murder of Harry Kalstedt, who served as the basis for the Fred Casely character.  The Tribune reported that Annan played the foxtrot record Hula Lou over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. Velma Kelly is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in Chicago, Billy Flynn. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women. Watkins' sensational columns documenting these trials proved so popular that she wrote a play based on them. The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. Cecil B. DeMille produced a silent film version, Chicago , starring former Mack Sennett bathing beauty Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as Roxie Hart starring Ginger Rogers, but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it. In the 1960s, Gwen Verdon read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized. Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her estate sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse. John Kander and Fred Ebb began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional vaudeville number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and choreographed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_86", "question": "Who was the producer of Secret of Mana?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_26793", "text": "The original score for Secret of Mana was composed and produced by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure, was originally slated for the project, but was replaced with Kikuta after he had started on other projects, such as Romancing SaGa. Secret of Mana was Kikuta's first video game score, and he encountered difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the Super NES. Kikuta tried to express in the music two \"contrasting styles\" to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24\u00a0hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, \"immersive\" and \"three-dimensional\". Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta stated in 2001 that he considered the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation. The soundtrack's music includes both \"ominous\" and \"light-hearted\" tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and \"dark, solemn pianos\". Kikuta's compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from Bali. Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, \"Fear of the Heavens\", to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game's music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a \"whale noise\", rather than a traditional \"ping\", in order to try to \"more deeply connect\" the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the Super NES was a difficult technical challenge. An official soundtrack album, Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version, was released in Japan in August 1993, containing 44 musical tracks from the game. An English version, identical to the Japanese original aside from its localized packaging and track titles, was later released in North America in December 1994 as Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, making Secret of Mana one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release outside of Japan. An album of arranged music from Secret of Mana and its sequel Seiken Densetsu 3 was produced in 1993 as Secret of Mana+. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. Secret of Mana+ contains a single track, titled \"Secret of Mana\", that incorporates themes from the music of both Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was still under development at the time. The style of the album has been described by critics as \"experimental\", using \"strange sounds\" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and \"typing\" sounds. The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as \"Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians\". The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album. The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original Super NES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are \"how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it\", without the limitations of the Super NES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, noted that the differences were minor. Music for the 2018 remake, which features remastered versions of the original soundtrack, was overseen by Kikuta and arranged by numerous game composers, such as Yuzo Koshiro and Tsuyoshi Sekito. The soundtrack was released as an album, also titled Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, shortly after the remake's release in February 2018.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased . In the story, the Doctor encounters both the Master and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series. Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by \"Time Crash\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor Peter Davison. A set of two mini-episodes, titled \"Space\" and \"Time\" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event. During Children in Need 2011, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need.

As such when promoting the film he noted that it's \"80 percent factual information.\" According to script writer Michael Wallach, the script originally started out as a short story about a young couple who comes across a dead town. After having pieced together what happened from footage scattered across town, they realize the town had not fully died yet. Barry was happy with the script, and sent Wallach the movie JFK: 3 Shots That Changed America and asked if the movie could be made into a documentary. Levinson chose to use the found footage format after thinking about the Pompeii disaster and noting that if such a disaster happened today there would be much more evidence of what happened with him telling Yahoo! \"For the very first time in history, you can get a picture of that town, if you collect all the footage from everyone's cell phones and their digital cameras and the Skypes, and the texting and everything else\" A byproduct of the format was that much of the footage was able to be shot by the actors themselves as opposed to a more traditional camera crew.

To compensate for this loss, co-executive producers Vince Gilligan and John Shiban decided to write an episode based around The Lone Gunmen. The writers wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines, mostly notably the disappearance of Susanne Modeski, who had last appeared in season five's \"The Unusual Suspects\". Gilligan explained, \"I'd been thinking a lot about what happened to Susanne Modeski\u2014what happened to her after she drove off with X in that mysterious car at the end of 'Unusual Suspects'\".

The character first appeared in the 1954 film Godzilla and became a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in various media, including 32 films produced by Toho, four Hollywood films and numerous video games, novels, comic books and television shows. Godzilla has been dubbed the \"King of the Monsters\", a phrase first used in Godzilla, King of the Monsters! , the Americanized version of the original film. Godzilla is an enormous, destructive, prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation. With the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Lucky Dragon 5 incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons. Others have suggested that Godzilla is a metaphor for the United States, a giant beast woken from its slumber which then takes terrible vengeance on Japan. As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones, portraying Godzilla as an antihero, or a lesser threat who defends humanity. Later films address themes including Japan's forgetfulness over its imperial past, natural disasters, and the human condition. Godzilla has featured alongside many supporting characters. It has faced human opponents such as the JSDF, or other monsters, including King Ghidorah, Mechagodzilla and Gigan.

In the same vein, British scholar Charles Francis Keary suggests that Hera had some sort of \"Earth Goddess\" worship in ancient times, connected to her possible origin as a Pelasgian goddess . According to Homeric Hymn III to Delian Apollo, Hera detained Eileithyia to prevent Leto from going into labor with Artemis and Apollo, since the father was Zeus. The other goddesses present at the birthing on Delos sent Iris to bring her. As she stepped upon the island, the divine birth began.

The Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo makes the monster Typhaon the offspring of archaic Hera in her Minoan form, produced out of herself, like a monstrous version of Hephaestus, and whelped in a cave in Cilicia. She gave the creature to Python to raise. In the Temple of Hera, Olympia, Hera's seated cult figure was older than the warrior figure of Zeus that accompanied it.

He eventually manages to dislodge the RV from the boulder by getting on the front and rocking it until it eventually wobbles and tips forward enough to slide down from atop the boulder. Now riding on the front while it is traveling at a frenzied pace, Bob barely manages to return to his family in time. While Bob is attempting a similar ruse the next day, the parking brake fails again and the RV rolls into a lake. Bob comes clean about the true purpose of the trip, and his family becomes upset that he would treat them like that. Still needing to get to the meeting, he asks them for help, but they refuse. He retrieves one of their bicycles from the lake the RV rolled into and pedals off by himself. His family hitchhikes and is then picked up by the Gornickes, and soon realize how well they get along with each other. Bob appears again, climbing atop the moving RV. He apologizes to his family, and they, in turn, apologize to him for their selfishness and reveal that they love him more than the lifestyle his job gives them. As support, the two families accompany Bob to the next meeting. At the meeting, Bob starts his speech and it goes well, but then he has an epiphany and recommends against the merger, realizing that Todd's selfishness would destroy a great independent company. Todd gets upset and tries to dismiss Bob's claims, but Cassie backs her father up by saying Todd was outsourcing the company; in retaliation, Todd fires Bob on the spot. Carl gets angry at Todd and flips him over his shoulder, onto the ground. Bob tells Todd that he quits anyway. Bob soon retrieves the sodden-but-still-operable RV from the lake. At the end, he is offered a job by the owners of Alpine Soda, who want to go national independently with Bob. In addition, at the same time, the parking brake fails once again, causing the RV to roll backwards, flattening both a police car and the Alpine Soda company owner's car. As the closing credits roll, the two families are shown dancing to and singing \"Route 66\" .", "hasanswer": false}]}

One day, his young son Irfaan meets an accident and is taken to a hospital, but due to a fatwa instigated by a wanted terrorist named Malik Ul Khan forbidding doctors to treat policemen and their families, the doctors refuse to treat Irfaan out of fear of letting their families suffer Malik's wrath. Even when an angry Inayat threatens to punish the doctors if they don't treat Irfaan, they still refuse do so by saying that they would rather face their punishment than let their families suffer Malik's wrath. As such, Irfaan dies succumbing to his injuries, and Inayat swears revenge on Malik for this. Eventually, Inayat and his men were able to track down Malik and his men at a village called Dalgate, and they manage to kill them all. Unfortunately, a family caught in the crossfire is killed by accident, and a young boy named Altaaf is the only survivor traumatized by the deaths of his parents and sister. Inayat's wife Neelima, feeling sorry for Altaaf, attempts to persuade Inayat to adopt Altaaf. Despite fearing that Altaaf may one day discover the truth and get revenge for it, Inayat reluctantly agrees as he is wracked with remorse for killing Altaaf's family. Just when Altaaf seems to have settled down in his new home and accepted Inayat and Neelima as his new parents, he learns that Inayat was one of the policemen who killed his family. After an unsuccessful attempt on Inayat's life, the young Altaaf runs away and is found and brought up by a terrorist group led by their Pathan leader Hilal Kohistani, who brainwashes him into thinking that he and his men act according to Islamic principles and trains him to become a terrorist. Ten years later, Hilal and an adult Altaaf are assigned the task of completing \"Mission Kashmir,\" a plan of an unnamed terrorist sponsor that involves; or so Altaaf is told, killing the Indian Prime Minister. Hilal uses Altaaf's hatred as a means to achieve his own goals while encouraging the latter to target Inayat, who is now an Inspector General, for his family's death. Altaaf visits his childhood friend and television personality Sufiya Parvez and, though he falls in love with her, uses her to try and make Hilal's plan of blowing up the local TV tower of Srinagar on Khan's birthday successful. He makes another unsuccessful attempt on Inayat's life, which results in him being branded as a wanted criminal by the media and a fallout between Inayat and Neelima. Sufiya also learns of Altaaf's true occupation and breaks off her relationship with him. On the same date that Atlaaf's family was murdered, Altaaf makes another attempt on Inayat by having three of Hilal's men plant a bomb in Khan's briefcase. Unfortunately, Neelima falls victim to it by accident, much to the complete devastation of both Inayat and Altaaf, with the former having lost his chance to apologize for his argument with her and the latter being wracked with extreme remorse for killing her. Following Neelima's funeral, Inayat manages to invade one of the terrorists' hideouts and discovers evidence and information about Mission Kashmir after capturing the  men who planted the bomb. After going through some cassette tapes with the help of Sufiya, Inayat learns that the true goal of Mission Kashmir is to launch missiles on local places of Hindu and Muslim worship to escalate Hindu-Muslim conflict across the subcontinent, thereby dividing Kashmir and turning it into a war zone. It also turns out that the attack on the TV tower was planned by Hilal to spread the rumor of assassinating the Prime Minister to cover up the true plot. Inayat also learns that Hilal deliberately kept the true plot of Mission Kashmir a secret from Altaaf for he fears that Altaaf would not support it. This is made evident when Atlaaf leaves to the swampy hideouts to prepare for the launches, Hilal secretly tells one of his men to keep an eye on Atlaaf and kill him if he doesn't consent over the true targets. By staging a fire in the jail that allows one of the bomb-briefcase men to escape, Inayat and his men manage to track down and capture Hilal. Inayat offers to make a deal with Hilal: going under the false pretense of allowing Hilal and his men to continue forward with Mission Kashmir in exchange for killing Altaaf to avenge Neelima's death. Seeing that Inayat's 'hatred' of Altaaf is worthy of a Pathan's duty, Hilal accepts the deal, and to ensure no other mistake will be made, Inayat goes alone with Hilal to the hideouts. As Hilal and Inayat reach the hideouts, Hilal tells Altaaf of Inayat's whereabouts. An enraged Altaaf starts beating up a weary Inayat, but the latter reveals to him the true goals of Mission Kashmir, stating that Kashmir will be turned into hell if he lets Hilal destroy the holy shrines. Hilal orders Altaaf to shoot Inayat, who is willing to accept his fate after expressing his dear love for Altaaf and remorse for killing his family. As Altaaf struggles to do it, he remembers that Neelima took him to the shrines and the comment Neelima said about choosing sides during her visit earlier. Unwilling to betray his mother, Atlaaf decides to put his plan of revenge aside and aids Inayat in stopping Hilal and his men from targeting the holy shrines. However, Hilal throws a bomb to distract them before getting shot to death by Altaaf, giving Hilal's men a chance to prepare to blow up the shrines. While Inayat shoots down several terrorists, Altaaf redeems himself by taking possession of a missile launcher and using it to destroy the other launchers and kill the remaining terrorists, thus saving the shrines. However, Altaaf gets shot in the torso and falls into the swamps. Inayat jumps in and rescues the unconscious Altaaf by bringing him to shore, evading the explosion of the hideouts caused by Altaaf's act of redemption. The plans of Mission Kashmir are revealed to the public by the media, and the terrorist sponsor's hideout is found by Kashmiri police, who shoot the sponsor as he tries to get away after killing two of his associates. Altaaf wakes up from a pleasant dream, where he reconciles with Sufiya and forgives Inayat, accepting the latter as his father again after 10 years.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, with Criminal Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced. Later, CBS approached CSI: NY writer Peter M. Lenkov to pitch a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov himself was a fan of the original. When executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman known about the remake, the two were originally hesitant to participate, but were impressed by Lenkov's pitch, since the story had \"such a great kind of paradigm for the show and how to really get into the characters that he really talked us into it.\" All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film. The producers discussed changing Kono to a female character. Lenkov noted that the producers did not have reservations as he initially though, but instead embraced the idea, as it would empower women in the remake by including them as main characters and not just victims or other minor characters. The pilot episode of the original series already established the Five-O task force, and when writing the pilot Lenkov wanted to give a proper introduction to the characters so that the audience can get to know them. Another difference in both the original and reimagined shows was the genre; the original was more police procedural, whereas the remake would be more action orientated, as well as some comedy mixed in, particularly from the banter between McGarrett and Danny. In the original script, there was no fighting between the two main characters, but the producers felt this would launch their partnership. Lenkov also included the return of an iconic catch phrase from the original series, \"Book 'em, Danno\". A table read-through of the pilot took place on February 19, 2010.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the month of Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and to prepare for a pilgrimage to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion. Negotiations commenced with emissaries traveling to and from Mecca. While these continued, rumors spread that one of the Muslim negotiators, Uthman bin al-Affan, had been killed by the Quraysh. Muhammad called upon the pilgrims to make a pledge not to flee if the situation descended into war with Mecca. This pledge became known as the \"Pledge of Acceptance\" or the \"Pledge under the Tree\". News of Uthman's safety allowed for negotiations to continue, and a treaty scheduled to last ten years was eventually signed between the Muslims and Quraysh. The main points of the treaty included: cessation of hostilities, the deferral of Muhammad's pilgrimage to the following year, and agreement to send back any Meccan who emigrated to Medina without permission from their protector. Many Muslims were not satisfied with the treaty. However, the Quranic sura \"Al-Fath\" assured them that the expedition must be considered a victorious one. It was later that Muhammad's followers realized the benefit behind the treaty. These benefits included the requirement of the Meccans to identify Muhammad as an equal, cessation of military activity allowing Medina to gain strength, and the admiration of Meccans who were impressed by the pilgrimage rituals. After signing the truce, Muhammad assembled an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, known as the Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam . He sent messengers to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire , Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu'tah.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_110", "question": "Who was the producer of The Drum?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_35634", "text": "Who Are You was recorded when punk rock was popular. This is not reflected in the album's music, which incorporates elements of progressive rock and, according to biographer Tony Fletcher, it was produced in such a way as to appeal to commercial rock radio at the time. The album showcased some of Townshend's most complicated arrangements, with multiple layers of synthesizer and strings. Many of the songs also revisited themes from Townshend's long-contemplated Lifehouse project, featuring lyrics about songwriting and music as a metaphor for life, as indicated by titles like \"Guitar and Pen\", \"New Song\", \"Music Must Change\", and \"Sister Disco\". The latter two, along with \"Who Are You\", ultimately appeared on Lifehouse Chronicles, Townshend's later actualization of the project. Several of the song's lyrics also reflect Townshend's uncertainty about the Who's continued relevance in the wake of punk rock, and his dissatisfaction with the music industry. There was a three-year hiatus between Who Are You and the Who's previous album, The Who by Numbers. The band was drifting apart during this period, as band members were working on various solo projects, and Moon was driving deeper into drug and alcohol abuse. The initial sessions at Ramport Studios, produced by Glyn Johns and Jon Astley, were lackadaisical; Jon Astley recalled that \"no one wanted to work\", and the members looked forward more to drinking and reminiscing at six in the evening. Astley felt that he and Johns pushed Moon too hard to play a simpler style, while Johns believed that Moon had \"lost confidence in his ability\" and would deliberately go out of his way to resist his suggestions. Moon's health was especially an object of concern, as his drumming skills had noticeably deteriorated and his performances for most of the sessions were substandard. He was unable to play in 6/8 time on the track \"Music Must Change\", so the drums were removed completely from the track, and replaced with the sound of footsteps and a few cymbal crashes. Bassist John Entwistle remarked that Moon \"couldn't think of anything to play.\" On another occasion, Astley recalled, \"I was doing a drum track, and he hadn't learned the song. I actually had to stand up and conduct. He said, 'Can you give me a cue when you get to the middle part?' [...] He hadn't done his homework.\" Entwistle similarly described Moon as \"really out of condition\", and \"disgusted with himself\" as a result. The recording was further delayed when lead singer Roger Daltrey underwent throat surgery, and when during a lengthy Christmas break, Townshend sliced his hand in a window during an argument with his parents. Former Zombies and Argent member Rod Argent was also called in to replace session keyboardist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick after Bundrick suffered a broken arm falling out of a taxi at the studio door. When the sessions resumed in March, they were moved to RAK Studios, which caused further delays due to the equipment malfunctioning, including the wiping of a backing track. Astley stated that the RAK equipment made the existing material sound different when played back, necessitating further delays as he attempted to fix the audio problems. In one incident, Daltrey punched Johns in the face due to an argument over a rough mix, rendering him unconscious. The argument was fueled by Ted Astley adding a string arrangement to \"Had Enough\", which Daltrey derided as \"slushy\". After one long and frustrating day, Townshend planned to fire Moon from the band unless he cleaned up his act. The plan drove Moon to attempt to kick his alcohol habit and work more enthusiastically. Due to a prior commitment to produce the Joan Armatrading album To the Limit, Johns had to leave in April, with Astley remaining as sole producer. Under Astley's command, the sessions returned to Ramport, with all of the drums except for \"Who Are You\" recorded in the last two weeks of production. Who Are You was released on 18 August 1978. Moon died on 7 September 1978, just under a month after the album's release; on the cover, he is shown sitting in a chair labelled \"Not to be taken away\". Photographer Terry O'Neil had insisted Moon sit with the back of the chair facing the camera so as to hide his distended stomach, a result of his alcoholism.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As such when promoting the film he noted that it's \"80 percent factual information.\" According to script writer Michael Wallach, the script originally started out as a short story about a young couple who comes across a dead town. After having pieced together what happened from footage scattered across town, they realize the town had not fully died yet. Barry was happy with the script, and sent Wallach the movie JFK: 3 Shots That Changed America and asked if the movie could be made into a documentary. Levinson chose to use the found footage format after thinking about the Pompeii disaster and noting that if such a disaster happened today there would be much more evidence of what happened with him telling Yahoo! \"For the very first time in history, you can get a picture of that town, if you collect all the footage from everyone's cell phones and their digital cameras and the Skypes, and the texting and everything else\" A byproduct of the format was that much of the footage was able to be shot by the actors themselves as opposed to a more traditional camera crew. According to Levinson roughly one third of the film was shot this way. Though the film is set in Levinson's home state of Maryland, it was shot on locations in North Carolina and South Carolina.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny , his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa and his conflicted best friend Mark . A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so-called due to its events taking place entirely in a single room. A number of publications have labeled The Room as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe The Room as \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies.\" Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters, The Room quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off-kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast. The Disaster Artist, Sestero's memoir of the making of The Room, was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013.

Spot, Leonard, and Mrs. Helperman continue on their way to Florida, singing through all fifty states . Meanwhile, back at home, Pretty Boy and Mr. Jolly learn that Krank can't actually turn animals into people, but rather into terrifying hybrid creatures.

Mrs. Helperman invites Scott in for coffee and soon begins to fall for him. Scott considers marrying Leonard's mother so they can all stay together, but Leonard refuses to allow it.

Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, with Criminal Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced. Later, CBS approached CSI: NY writer Peter M. Lenkov to pitch a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov himself was a fan of the original. When executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman known about the remake, the two were originally hesitant to participate, but were impressed by Lenkov's pitch, since the story had \"such a great kind of paradigm for the show and how to really get into the characters that he really talked us into it.\" All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film. The producers discussed changing Kono to a female character. Lenkov noted that the producers did not have reservations as he initially though, but instead embraced the idea, as it would empower women in the remake by including them as main characters and not just victims or other minor characters. The pilot episode of the original series already established the Five-O task force, and when writing the pilot Lenkov wanted to give a proper introduction to the characters so that the audience can get to know them. Another difference in both the original and reimagined shows was the genre; the original was more police procedural, whereas the remake would be more action orientated, as well as some comedy mixed in, particularly from the banter between McGarrett and Danny. In the original script, there was no fighting between the two main characters, but the producers felt this would launch their partnership. Lenkov also included the return of an iconic catch phrase from the original series, \"Book 'em, Danno\". A table read-through of the pilot took place on February 19, 2010.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_132", "question": "Who was the producer of The Situation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_47197", "text": "Gladiator was based on an original pitch by David Franzoni, who wrote the first draft. Franzoni was given a three-picture deal with DreamWorks as writer and co-producer on the strength of his previous work, Steven Spielberg's Amistad, which helped establish the reputation of DreamWorks. Franzoni was inspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 novel Those About to Die, and he chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ancient Roman Historia Augusta. In Franzoni's first draft, dated April 4, 1998, he named his protagonist Narcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Emperor Commodus to death. Ridley Scott was approached by producers Walter F. Parkes and Douglas Wick. They showed him a copy of Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me's 1872 painting entitled Pollice Verso . Scott was enticed by filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, Scott felt Franzoni's dialogue was too \"on the nose\" and hired John Logan to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's motivation. Russell Crowe describes being eager for the role as pitched by Parkes, in his interview for Inside the Actors Studio: \"They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman General.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.\" With two weeks to go before filming, the actors complained of problems with the script. William Nicholson was brought to Shepperton Studios to make Maximus a more sensitive character. Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying, \"he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.\" The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions, with several actors providing changes. Crowe questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.\" Crowe described the script situation: \"I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\" Of the writing and filming process, Crowe added, \"Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my 'volatility' has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it\u00a0\u2013 what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.\" Maximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer. In a conversation with Marcus Aurelius, Maximus says the fecund soil of his farm is \"black like my wife's hair\". Crowe wrote the speech himself, drawing on his feelings of homesickness for his own farm. In preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot. Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England. All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to high costs and unavailability of the items.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Director Ron Howard chose to treat Angels & Demons as a sequel to the previous film, rather than a prequel, since many had read the novel after The Da Vinci Code. He liked the idea that Langdon had been through one adventure and become a more confident character. Howard was also more comfortable taking liberties in adapting the story because this novel was less popular than The Da Vinci Code. Producer Brian Grazer said they were too \"reverential\" when adapting The Da Vinci Code, which resulted in it being \"a little long and stagey\". This time, \"Langdon doesn't stop and give a speech. When he speaks, he's in motion.\" Howard concurred \"it's very much about modernity clashing with antiquity and technology vs. faith, so these themes, these ideas are much more active whereas the other one lived so much in the past.

He liked it, but he did not think it would impress others. The most successful comedies at the time like Animal House , Porky's , and Fast Times at Ridgemont High , featured sexual and bawdy elements; Back to the Future was considered too tame in comparison. The project went into turnaround\u2014a process allowing other studios to purchase the idea. The script was rejected approximately 40 times, sometimes multiple times by the same studios. Reasons given included the concept being unappealing to contemporary rebellious youth, and the failures of other time travel films like The Final Countdown and Time Bandits . Walt Disney Productions turned it down because they considered Marty having to fight off his future mother's advances too risqu\u00e9 for their brand. The only person supportive of the project was Spielberg. However, with their previous collaborations considered relative failures, Gale and Zemeckis feared another misstep would give them a reputation of only getting work because they were friends with Spielberg. Zemeckis opted to accept the next project offered to him, Romancing the Stone . Against pre-release expectations, the film was a significant success, and gave Zemeckis enough credibility to return to Back to the Future. Zemeckis held a grudge against the studios that had failed to support the project and turned to Spielberg, who had set up his own production company, Amblin Entertainment, at Universal Studios, where Price now worked. Spielberg disliked Price because he rejected E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and demanded his involvement in Back to the Future be minimal. Sidney Sheinberg installed himself as chief executive to oversee the studio's investment in the project. Amblin executives Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joined Spielberg as the film's executive producers. However, rights to Back to the Future remained tied to Columbia Pictures. Guy McElwaine\u2014Price's successor at Columbia Pictures\u2014was developing a satire of the Universal-owned noir film Double Indemnity called Big Trouble . Its similarities to Double Indemnity meant the studio would violate Universal Pictures' copyright. With production imminent, McElwaine asked for the rights from Price; in exchange, Price obtained the rights to Back to the Future. Sheinberg suggested modifications to the film including changing the title to Space Man from Pluto because he believed Back to the Future would not resonate with audiences. Gale and Zemeckis did not know how to reject Sheinberg's suggestions without risking his ire. Spielberg intervened, sending Sheinberg a memo reading: \"Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep 'em coming.\" Spielberg knew Sheinberg would be too embarrassed to admit his memo was to be taken seriously. Sheinberg later claimed the story was \"bullshit\". He also wanted to change the name of Marty's mother from Meg to Lorraine , and rename Professor Brown to Doc Brown because he considered it more accessible. A third draft was completed by July 1984. The lengthy development allowed Gale and Zemeckis to refine the script's jokes, especially ones that had become dated since 1980. The joke about former actor Ronald Reagan becoming President of the United States remained following his re-election in 1984.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eugene gives a rousing speech, mentioning that the alumni who are missing from the reunion are surely present in-spirit. The scene segues to bring in the greaser gang known as the Burger Palace Boys and their auxiliary, the \"Pink Ladies\", as they sing a cruder version of the Rydell alma mater \"). Flashing back to the first day of high school in fall 1958, the Pink Ladies sit in the lunchroom, and the Burger Palace Boys sit at the entrance to the school. One of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy, introduces her new neighbor Sandy Dumbrowski, who had been unjustly rejected from a Catholic school, to the others , as well as Patty. Sandy tells of how she had a brief love affair the summer before, which ended with unresolved love. Meanwhile, womanizing greaser Danny Zuko is telling the Burger Palace Boys the story of his own summer fling . The Pink Ladies soon after realize that Sandy's summer fling was the same Danny Zuko that attends Rydell High and arrange for the two to bump into each other at school; the resulting meeting is tense and awkward, as Danny had previously told Sandy that he attended a private academy and does not want to admit to the Burger Palace Boys that she was the woman he was talking about. As the Burger Palace Boys leave, Sandy is heartbroken, but the Pink Ladies cheer her up, by inviting her over to Marty's pajama party. Shortly afterwards, the teenagers gather in the hall as Doody shows off his new guitar and performs a song . At Marty's pajama party, the girls experiment with wine, cigarettes, and pierced ears; and talk about boys. The sheltered Sandy goes into shock from seeing blood when the Pink Ladies try to pierce her ears, leading them to mock her when she's not in the room .

Heavily influenced by the various funk bands of the 1970s, Digital Underground sampled such music frequently, which became a defining element of West Coast rap. As \"Rackadelic\", Jacobs designed album covers and cartoon-laced liner notes, in homage to Parliament-Funkadelic album designs. Digital Underground is also notable for launching the career of member Tupac Shakur, as well as spinning off side projects and solo acts including Raw Fusion, Saafir, and singer Mystic.

The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that \"life goes on\" and end the series with \"their heads held high\". In the finale, Callum Stone has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding. The idea for the series finale came after research showed that rape is used to punish girl gang members. Series Producer Tim Key says \"That is what The Bill has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and we wanted it to be like that right up until the final shot.\" The final location shoot for the finale was carried out at a derelict estate in London which is due to be demolished.  The Bill was always filmed on location in London whenever possible, \"to keep the show authentic\".  Executive Producer Johnathan Young says \"We feel that London is a part of the show, it's a character within the show and we've really encouraged directors to look for graphic locations that give you a real sense of being part of a big metropolis\".  Examples of these would include police chases by boat along the River Thames and helicopters aiding searches. The police uniforms used in The Bill are authentic so when not in use they are locked away.  The uniforms were originally bought from the police who agreed to buy the uniforms back when the series ended. The final scene was a long take, filmed using a hand-held camera and featured 70 people in total.  Of the final scene, Keys said that the producers knew they had to do \"something special\" but also wanted to show that \"life goes on\".  To film the final scene, the cameraman had to keep the camera steady when following the characters going through the police station and then outside into the rear yard of the station where he stepped into a crane which then lifts to reveal the front of Sun Hill station. The shows producers were also included in the final scene, and played the part of journalists at the press conference hosted by Jack Meadows which Keys described as being \"eerie\" because \"you were sat there on the front row listening to Simon making a very moving speech that sums up the show and his time in it\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group would go on to release several major hits, including \"Don't Leave Me\" , the number one single \"No Diggity\" , and \"Girlfriend/Boyfriend\" . By 2011, the group had disbanded and reformed several times. In 2000, Riley worked with Spice Girl Melanie B on the tracks \"ABC 123\", \"I Believe\", and \"Pack Your S**t\" for her solo debut album Hot. He also worked on an album with Outsiderz 4 Life, producing \"Wil' Out\" and other songs. At the start of 2006, he was part of the New Jack Reunion Tour, featuring Blackstreet and Guy, in addition to After 7, SWV, and Tony Toni Ton\u00e9. In May 2006, Riley announced that he would be working on two key projects: a new Blackstreet album and a new Guy album. In 2008, Riley was the victim of a Ponzi scheme that left him bankrupt. In June 2008, a fire destroyed Riley's Virginia Beach recording studio. Fire investigators said that an electrical problem caused the blaze that burned the abandoned recording studio. The Virginia Beach Fire Department said lightning in the area also could have been a factor, although there was no direct strike.  The empty studio was for sale and was insured for $336,000. In 2009, Riley performed with Guy at the BET Awards. In the same year, Riley worked with Amerie and Robin Thicke on their respective albums. Leading on from his work on Snoop Dogg's album Ego Trippin', Riley became part of the production supergroup QDT, which features DJ Quik as well as Snoop Dogg. Riley produced and co-wrote the song \"Teeth\" with Lady Gaga for her EP The Fame Monster. Speaking in March 2010 to Blues & Soul's Pete Lewis \u2013 Riley said that he was no longer affiliated with Guy . Riley also said that the current line-up of Blackstreet consisted of himself, Chauncey Hannibal, Dave Hollister and Sherman 'J-Stylz' Tisdale.  He confirmed that he was working on a new Blackstreet album, though intended to release his own album \u2013 entitled 'TRX' \u2013 first. Artists he could possibly be working with for the project included Stevie Wonder and Elton John, plus his own new, upcoming acts. However, Hannibal stopped performing with the group and the lineup became Riley, Hollister, Mark Middleton and Eric Williams. In 2012, Hannibal returned to Blackstreet. Middleton and Williams left the group. As of 2019, the group's lineup now consists of Riley, Dave Hollister, J-Stylz, and Rodney Poe under the name \"Blackstreet 2.\" In an August 2010, co-executor of the Michael Jackson estate, John Branca, confirmed that a posthumous album of Michael Jackson would be released, containing work done in the previous five years with producers Neff-U, Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and Riley, as well as work written and produced solely by Jackson himself. The album Michael was released on December 14, 2010, in the United States. After the release, several people questioned some of the music Riley produced for the project. Riley insisted all of the songs were sung by Jackson and claimed that vocal artifacts were added from overprocessing Jackson's voice. However, Riley made comments in an interview with Dan Dodds in which he stated that there were some elements of his voice in the music. \"They may use some elements from me, put together ideas but I haven't been working on the new album\" Riley is reported to have said. Recently, Riley has stepped into the Korean music market. Riley worked with singer/rapper Jay Park on an English track titled \"Demon\", which was originally meant for Michael Jackson. Riley produced a mini album for the Korean girl group Rania. Riley is one of the producers part of the production team QDT, with DJ Quik and Snoop Dogg. He produced the tracks \"Believe\" and \"Flow\" for the Twenty album of the R&B group Boyz II Men.

Takagi also mentions that Mari is actually very insecure about herself and the only thing that he can do to support her is to sleep with her too. Even though she insists to continue her relationship with Takagi, she does not want to give up on Aki. Not only because she truly loves him, but also because she is dependent on Aki's music.

The idea for Jan and Michael to have a romantic relationship was conceived by Steve Carell as far back as the filming of the pilot episode. According to writer and producer Greg Daniels \"it was like he was turned on by his teacher.\" Writer and actor Paul Lieberstein said that the first idea that anybody came up for the episode was the final shot, where Jim and Michael look at each other and shake their heads, suggesting that they had been through similar experiences. The rest of the episode was written to lead to that scene. The scene where Oscar tells a story about a date getting a background check on him was based on an actual date that Paul Lieberstein went on. While filming, Steve Carell and Tim Meadows improvised a lot of their dinner scene, but most of it never made the final cut. One improvised scene that did make the final cut was the \"Baby Back Ribs\" song. In an interview, Jenna Fischer said that the rooftop scene was her favorite to shoot. Fischer recalled that \"there was a very small crew up on the roof and they had the cameras really far away.\" After the main shooting ended, producers decided to do a re-shoot to explain the \"Dwigt\" situation clearly and concisely. The kiss between Michael and Jan was rehearsed and filmed \"many, many, many times\", according to B. J. Novak. While editing the kiss between Michael and Jan, Greg Daniels brought many people into the editing room to see if they thought the kiss was too long or not long enough. During the production of the episode, the cast and crew were informed by NBC that the show would be picked up for a whole 22 episodes.

{"id": "164_154", "question": "Who was the producer of Innocent?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_5670", "text": "When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter, died on 13 July 1205, John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III that would lead to the King's excommunication. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the Church being \"governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre\" and established \"its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler\", in the words of historian Richard Huscroft. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English Church, albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome. These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. Pope Innocent was, according to historian Ralph Turner, an \"ambitious and aggressive\" religious leader, insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church. John wanted John de Gray, the Bishop of Norwich and one of his own supporters, to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral claimed the exclusive right to elect the Archbishop. They favoured Reginald, the chapter's sub-prior. To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop. The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent. John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de Gray, and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision. Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray, and instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton. John refused Innocent's request that he consent to Langton's appointment, but the Pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207. John was incensed about what he perceived as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election. He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole. He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place to try to convince John to change his mind, but to no avail. Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and confessions and absolutions for the dying. John treated the interdict as \"the equivalent of a papal declaration of war\". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, releasing them only after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the King in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to worry the King greatly. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks to John. Official figures suggest that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year. Innocent gave some dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic communities were allowed to celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England. Under mounting political pressure, John finally negotiated terms for a reconciliation, and the papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks annually: 700 marks for England and 300 marks for Ireland, as well as recompensing the Church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the , or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the compensation money he had promised the Church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship. Failure in France and the First Barons' War Tensions and discontent Tensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years, as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the King. Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as \"the Northerners\". The northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in France, and many of them owed large sums of money to John; the revolt has been characterised as \"a rebellion of the king's debtors\". Many of John's military household joined the rebels, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John. Tension also grew across North Wales, where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict. For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was an important factor, as he was considered an \"abrasive foreigner\" by many of the barons. The failure of John's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king; James Holt describes the path to civil war as \"direct, short and unavoidable\" following the defeat at Bouvines.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is considered one of the most antisemitic films of all time. The film was directed by Veit Harlan, who wrote the screenplay with Eberhard Wolfgang M\u00f6ller and Ludwig Metzger. The leading roles were played by Ferdinand Marian and Harlan's wife Kristina S\u00f6derbaum; Werner Krauss and Heinrich George played key supporting roles. The film has been characterized as \"one of the most notorious and successful pieces of antisemitic film propaganda produced in Nazi Germany.\" It was a great success in Germany, and was seen by 20 million people. Although its budget of 2 million Reichsmarks was considered high for films of that era, the box office receipts of 6.5 million Reichsmarks made it a financial success. Heinrich Himmler urged members of the SS and police to see it. After the war, some of the leading cast members were brought to trial as part of the denazification process. They generally defended their participation in the film on the grounds that they had only done so under duress. Despite significant evidence to support their arguments, Susan Tegel, author of Nazis and the Cinema, characterizes their postwar attempts to distance themselves from the film as \"crass and self-serving\"; she argues that their motives for accepting the roles seem to have been more driven by opportunistic ambition than by antisemitism. Harlan was the only major movie director of the Third Reich to stand trial for crimes against humanity. After three trials, he was given a light sentence because he convinced the courts that the antisemitic content of the film had been dictated by Goebbels and that Harlan had worked to moderate the antisemitism. Eventually, Harlan was reinstated as a citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany and made nine more films. He remained a controversial figure and the target of protests. Together with Die Rothschilds and Der ewige Jude, both released in 1940, the film remains one of the most frequently discussed examples of the use of film to further the Nazi antisemitic agenda. In the 2000s, two documentary films and a drama were released that explore the history and impact of the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The ideas for the album's music videos formed during the early Discovery recording sessions. The album was originally intended to be accompanied by \"a live-action film with each song being a part of the film\", according to Todd Edwards. The band decided instead to concentrate on an anime production. Daft Punk's concept for the film involved the merging of science fiction with entertainment industry culture. The duo recalled watching Japanese anime as children, including favorites such as Captain Harlock, Grendizer, and Candy Candy. All three brought the album and the completed story to Tokyo in the hope of creating the film with their childhood hero, Leiji Matsumoto, who had created Captain Harlock. After Matsumoto joined the team as visual supervisor, Shinji Shimizu had been contacted to produce the animation and Kazuhisa Takenouchi to direct the film.  With the translation coordination of Tamiyuki \"Spike\" Sugiyama, production began in October 2000 and ended in April 2003. The result of the collaboration was an anime film, Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, which features the entirety of Discovery as the soundtrack. Daft Punk adopted robot costumes in the lead up to Discoverys release. The group told the press they were working in their studio at 9:09\u00a0am on 9 September 1999, when their sampler exploded.

Winslet was originally cast as Hanna, but scheduling difficulties with Revolutionary Road led her to leave the film and Nicole Kidman was cast as her replacement. In January 2008, Kidman left the project, citing her recent pregnancy as the primary reason. She had not filmed any scenes yet, so the studio was able to recast Winslet without affecting the production schedule. Filming took place in Berlin, G\u00f6rlitz, on the Kirnitzschtal tramway near Bad Schandau, and finished in the MMC Studios K\u00f6ln in Cologne on July 14. Filmmakers received $718,752 from Germany's Federal Film Board.  Overall, the studio received $4.1 million from Germany's regional and federal subsidiaries. Schlink insisted the film be shot in English rather than German, as it posed questions about living in a post-genocide society that went beyond mid-century Germany. Daldry and Hare toured locations from the novel with Schlink, viewed documentaries about that period in German history, and read books and articles about women who had served as SS guards in the camps. Hare, who rejected using a voiceover narration to render the long internal monologues in the novel, also changed the ending so that Michael starts to tell the story of Hanna and him to his daughter. \"It's about literature as a powerful means of communication, and at other times as a substitute for communication\", he explained. The filming of sex scenes with Kross and Winslet were delayed until Kross turned 18. The primary cast, all of whom were German besides Fiennes, Olin, and Winslet, decided to emulate Kross's accent since he had just learned English for the film. Chris Menges replaced Roger Deakins as cinematographer. One of the film's producers, Scott Rudin, left the production over a dispute about the rushed editing process to ensure a 2008 release date and had his name removed from the credit list. Rudin differed with Harvey Weinstein \"because he didn't want to campaign for an Oscar along with Doubt and Revolutionary Road, which also stars Winslet.\" Winslet won the Best Actress Academy Award for The Reader. Marc Caro wrote, \"Because Winslet couldn't get Best Actress nominations for both movies, the Weinstein Co. shifted her to supporting actress for The Reader as a courtesy...\" but that it is \"...up to [the voters] to place the name in the category that they think is appropriate to the performance\", resulting in her receiving more Best Actress nomination votes for this film than the Best Actress submission of her Revolutionary Road performance. Winslet's head-to-head performances also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for Revolutionary Road and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Reader.

As they look for Jimmy, Pearl steps in the elevator which closes and goes up. Meanwhile, Jeremiah asks Jimmy what he wants. He asks Jeremiah if he could give him his life back. When Jeremiah says he can't do that, Jimmy sends him to hell. Pearl gets off the elevator and walks into a room that is filled with ignited candles. She has a flashback and Jimmy appears and puts the bloody dress on her. Patrick, Cynthia, and Bill head to the second floor where they see a ghostly Maurice, who leads Bill in the wrong direction where he is captured and killed.

The majority of the bass parts on the album are played by Tony Levin , with Squire only playing bass on \"Lift Me Up\", \"Saving My Heart\" and \"Miracle of Life\". Sherwood played the bass on \"The More We Live- Let Go\". Squire sang backing vocals on the four tracks Yes produced, as well as several of the ABWH-produced tracks, including \"I Would Have Waited Forever\", \"Without Hope \" and \"Dangerous \".

They are intercepted by what seems to be a wrecked spaceship only to find that it contains a lone survivor; a young woman named Sara Cyanbaker. Unknown to the crew at this time, a mechanized space fleet approaches Earth and a scout vessel from that fleet was responsible for the destruction of Sara's ship. Sara begins to have strange dreams about a place called Odin and a series of artifacts discovered on a lonely asteroid point to an ancient Norwegian mariner's folk song which mentioned the Norse god Odin. The crew decipher these artifacts and deduce that Odin may actually exist as a place, the paradise planet so often spoken of in mythology. The young crew is eager to make the journey but the captain and the ship's senior officers observe the need to follow the orders of Earth Command and return to Earth immediately. The crew mutinies and locks the senior officers in the officer's lounge and warp the ship to the location given in the artifacts. Upon arrival, the Starlight meet a cosmic being who appears before them in space. He identifies himself as Asgard and declares that he will block the gateway to paradise against corrupt beings of flesh and all other non-believers. As a result, the Starlight faces an almost endless swarm of mechanized attack ships. The Starlight crew successfully fights its way through to land on what appears to be a mechanized world only to face hordes of mechanized soldiers. Surviving the onslaught, Sara and the crew is horrified to learn that these soldiers are actually part living beings. A dying soldier hands a crew member a crystal memory chip and asks him to insert it into a computer display readout. Through it, the crew learn of the soldier's memories of Odin and the entire story of the alien people's exodus. Legends once told of a paradise destroyed by a kingdom of fire. Odin was once a planet that faced destruction by the radiation of its expanding sun, Canopus. Its people built giant computerized starships to monitor their exodus to find another world yet many stayed on Odin in the hopes that the fires of Canopus would die out. The computers on the ships ultimately developed sentience and transformed its humanoid refugees into cyborgs leaving those remaining on Odin the only ones who remained as themselves. The machines built larger machines to ensure that the mission succeeds resulting in an eventual corruption of the original purpose. Now these machines sought only to destroy all organic life. The dying soldier, noted that Sara not only looked like the queen of Odin's people, but that Sara was the queen's name. Sara confirms that there might be a connection as she recounts her own memories of The Tree of Life and how she was sheltered by two giants in her childhood. The cyborg soldier's dying words suggest that if Sara has these memories then Odin and its people may still live. The crew promises to dedicate themselves to finding Odin. However, they must still defeat the master computer of this machine world; a being that calls itself Belgel. The crew finds a way to insert a computer virus which causes Belgel to overload and destroy the world-fortress.

To accomplish this delicate task, the writers brought back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender , as well as those that had been introduced in the film, like the alien. Carter claims to have thought of the episode's rough plot almost two years prior, when he was developing the plot of The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan at the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on the phone casting others for future X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons. The scenes in an Arizona suburb were filmed in Valencia, California, because the producers wanted \"something really Edward Scissorhands.\" The scenes set in the nuclear power plant were filmed in a Long Beach, California-based building owned by the electricity supply company Southern California Edison. Due to a heat wave, many of the scenes were filmed \"in temperatures well above one hundred degrees\", and some lines had to be re-recorded in the studio due to excessive background noise. The scenes of the alien molting in the power plant's spent fuel pool were filmed in a tank of water located in Marina del Rey, California that was frequently used by the producers of the show Baywatch.

The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players. Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, \"violet buildings\" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game. Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger. Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player.

The band was formed of former members of Uriel, the other member of which was guitarist Steve Hillage. After Hillage left Uriel in August 1968, the other three continued as a trio. Having signed a deal with the Middle Earth club's management branch, they were advised to change their name to Egg, allegedly because Uriel \"sounded too much like 'urinal'\". In mid-1969 the band signed a deal with Decca's 'progressive' music subsidiary Deram and released their debut album in March 1970. While not a commercial success, it was received well enough for the label to finance the recording of a follow-up, but when the time came to release it, the label shelved it until producer Neil Slaven's lobbying finally resulted in The Polite Force coming out in February 1971. Now signed to The Groundhogs' management company, Egg finished the year with an increased touring schedule, but in spite of accumulating enough material for a third album, they were unable to secure another record deal, and split up in July 1972. In 1974 Stewart, who had signed with Virgin as a member of Hatfield and the North, got a deal for Egg to record their unreleased material, which resulted in the farewell album The Civil Surface.

Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, \"a trip home or a trip to the hospital\". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, \"Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts.\" Otto Kahn, the financier bankrolling the production, arrived on set as Wellman was filming the St-Mihiel battle sequence, inadvertently disrupted Wellman's detonation timings, and caused several extras to be seriously injured. Wellman loudly and profanely ordered Kahn off the set. That evening, Kahn visited Wellman in his hotel room, told him he was impressed with his direction, and he could have whatever he needed to finish the picture. The cast and crew had a lot of time on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, \"San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook\". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he was not impressed, considering the drama in it to be \"sudsy\", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the wardrobe that Paramount designer Travis Banton made for the film.

Tinners Way, born in 1990 to Secretariat's last crop, winner of the 1994 and 1995 Pacific Classic. Ultimately, Secretariat officially sired 663 named foals, including 341 winners and 54 stakes winners . There has been some criticism of Secretariat as a stallion, mainly because he did not produce male offspring of his own ability and did not leave a leading sire son behind, but his legacy is assured through the quality of his daughters, several of whom were excellent racers and even more of whom were excellent producers. In 1992, Secretariat was the leading broodmare sire in North America. Overall, Secretariat's daughters produced 24 Grade/Group 1 winners. As a broodmare sire, Secretariat's most notable progeny were: Weekend Surprise, a stakes winner and the 1992 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Her sons include 1990 Preakness winner Summer Squall and 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy. Terlingua, a stakes winner and dam of leading sire Storm Cat. Secrettame, a stakes winner and dam of important sire Gone West, whose descendants include Kentucky Derby winner Smarty Jones. Six Crowns, dam of champion two-year-old and sire Chief's Crown. Sister Dot, dam of champion two-year-old and sire Dehere. Celtic Assembly, dam of Volksraad, leading sire in New Zealand. Betty's Secret, dam of Secreto, winner of The Derby, and Istabraq, three-time winner of the Champion Hurdle.

Indy was the leading sire in North America in 2003 and 2006, and is the sire of 2003 Horse of the Year Mineshaft and 2007 Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches. He has also established a successful sire-line that leads to Kentucky Derby winners Orb and California Chrome. A.P. Indy's leading sire-line descendant is Tapit, who led the sire list in 2014\u20132015 and is the sire of Belmont Stakes winners Tonalist and Creator. Terlingua's son Storm Cat is also a two time leading sire, whose offspring include Giant's Causeway, three-time leading sire in North America. Storm Cat also sired Yankee Gentleman, who is the broodmare sire of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. Both Storm Cat and A.P. Indy appear in the pedigree of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify. Inbreeding to Secretariat has also proven successful, as exemplified by numerous graded stakes winners, including two-time Horse of the Year Wise Dan, as well as sprint champion Speightstown. Secretariat's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions: Drone, Sir Ivor, and Hall of Fame inductee Spectacular Bid.

It is considered one of the most antisemitic films of all time. The film was directed by Veit Harlan, who wrote the screenplay with Eberhard Wolfgang M\u00f6ller and Ludwig Metzger. The leading roles were played by Ferdinand Marian and Harlan's wife Kristina S\u00f6derbaum; Werner Krauss and Heinrich George played key supporting roles. The film has been characterized as \"one of the most notorious and successful pieces of antisemitic film propaganda produced in Nazi Germany.\" It was a great success in Germany, and was seen by 20 million people. Although its budget of 2 million Reichsmarks was considered high for films of that era, the box office receipts of 6.5 million Reichsmarks made it a financial success. Heinrich Himmler urged members of the SS and police to see it. After the war, some of the leading cast members were brought to trial as part of the denazification process. They generally defended their participation in the film on the grounds that they had only done so under duress. Despite significant evidence to support their arguments, Susan Tegel, author of Nazis and the Cinema, characterizes their postwar attempts to distance themselves from the film as \"crass and self-serving\"; she argues that their motives for accepting the roles seem to have been more driven by opportunistic ambition than by antisemitism. Harlan was the only major movie director of the Third Reich to stand trial for crimes against humanity. After three trials, he was given a light sentence because he convinced the courts that the antisemitic content of the film had been dictated by Goebbels and that Harlan had worked to moderate the antisemitism. Eventually, Harlan was reinstated as a citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany and made nine more films. He remained a controversial figure and the target of protests. Together with Die Rothschilds and Der ewige Jude, both released in 1940, the film remains one of the most frequently discussed examples of the use of film to further the Nazi antisemitic agenda.

Over a nine-month period he translated Hiiragi's Baron story into 525 pages of storyboards for what was to be The Cat Returns. Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki decided to produce a feature-length film based entirely on Morita's storyboard; this was partly because Haru, the main character, had a \"believable feel to her\".

In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who\u00a0\u2013 The Ultimate Adventure. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor. A pilot episode for a potential spinoff series, K-9 and Company, was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series. Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced. Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood , set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, Dreamland, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official Doctor Who website in 2009. Class, featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness. Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show's first episode. The series was picked up by BBC America on 8 January 2016 and by BBC One a day later. On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled. Numerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series Faction Paradox, Iris Wildthyme and Bernice Summerfield; as well as the made-for-video series P.R.O.B.E.; the Australian-produced television series K-9, which aired a 26-episode first season on Disney XD; and the audio spin-off Counter-Measures.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With Bryan Elsley as executive producer, the series began filming in February 2010 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The first episode of the US series is almost a shot-for-shot copy of the first episode of the UK series, but it deviates from the original plot in following episodes such that there are significant differences between the US and UK versions. Characters are also similar, and some names have been changed; Sid has been renamed Stanley, Cassie renamed Cadie and Jal renamed Daisy. In addition, Tony's younger sister Effy, who becomes a main character in Generation Two of UK Skins, was renamed Eura. However, the biggest change comes in the form of Tea, a lesbian cheerleader who replaces the UK gay character Maxxie who was a professional dancer. The show's cancellation was announced by MTV on 10 June 2011. The Parents Television Council, an advocacy group, criticised the show, calling it one of the worst shows a child could watch. Reasons cited for its cancellation included loss of advertising sponsors and a shrinking audience, with fewer people tuning in for each subsequent episode.

Principal photography began on January 10, 2012, lasted approximately 47 days and had a $30 million budget. The film was shot on film stock instead of digital because it was decided that the difference in cost between the two was negligible, and the day shooting and color palettes of the magicians' outfits such as black and red were thought to be captured better on the stock. Among the locations used during the Las Vegas shooting are interiors and exteriors at the Bally's Las Vegas hotel and casino, and exteriors of the Las Vegas Strip, Downtown Las Vegas, Fremont Street, and Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel. Scardino, who had not filmed in Las Vegas since helming an episode of Tracey Takes On... approximately fifteen years earlier, described shooting on location in the city as \"an absolute must\". Scardino added \"We just felt that, to give the movie authenticity, it had to be on the Strip\". Carell was filmed on the Strip because Scardino believed his character is \"a creature of the Strip,\" while Carrey was filmed \"in and around Fremont Street,\" where his character felt more at home. Scardino explained the decision to film the characters in these environments, saying the \"two different worlds\" of Vegas \"helps define our talent,\" with the \"ever-changing Strip\" providing contrast with \"the frozen-in-time aspect of Fremont Street.\" By January 16, 2012, filming moved to Los Angeles and southern California, including the Wadsworth Theatre. Filming had concluded by March 13, 2012, after forty-nine days. When Scardino boarded the project, the script contained several magic tricks that could not realistically occur on stage such as lasers decapitating two individuals and the heads then switching bodies, which would have required the use of computer visual effects to accomplish. Scardino insisted that most of the magic tricks should be credible feats to make the magicians seem more believable, but some tricks still required the use of visual effects. David Copperfield served as a technical advisor on the film and developed a live stage illusion for the film's climax, featuring a body switch between Carell's and Buscemi's characters. Scardino insisted that the illusion should not depend on camera tricks, stating \"I wanted one big stage illusion where you go, 'Oh, wow, how'd they do that?'\" Copperfield provided instructions on how the trick worked and was present on set during its filming. The production also used other magic advisors who ensured that hand movements during tricks were correct, and also served as hand-doubles. Producer Chris Bender said that the film is meant to be set in a fictional history of the world of magic, and so the filmmakers avoided casting many real magicians, so that it would not seem that the film was intended to be set in reality.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This was a different edit which included Re-Gyptian Strut and Music For Guitar & Low Budget Orch, which were later cut from the album. The same year Zappa negotiated a distribution deal for an orchestral album with Columbia Masterworks, but the deal fell through when Columbia did not agree to Zappa's terms. Zappa also played a demo disc of an unreleased orchestral album in 1976, according to biographer Barry Miles. In May 1976 Zappa's relationship with manager and business partner Herb Cohen ended in litigation. Zappa and Cohen's company DiscReet Records was distributed by Warner Bros. Records. At this point Zappa was still contracted to deliver four more albums to Warner for release on Discreet. In March 1977 Zappa delivered master tapes for all four albums to Warner to fulfill this contract. Zappa did not receive payment from Warner upon delivery of the tapes, which was a contract violation. In a 1978 radio interview Zappa listed the four albums delivered to Warner and called this album by the title Zappa Orchestral Favorites. After a long legal between Zappa and Warner, the Discreet label eventually released four Zappa albums during 1978 and 1979: Zappa In New York, Studio Tan, Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites. Much of the material from these four albums was also edited by Zappa into a four-LP box set called L\u00e4ther.

Posey only appeared in the show's unaired pilot; which is included on the DVD release of Season 1. John Stamos's character was originally named Jesse Cochran; Stamos reportedly wanted his character to better reflect his Greek heritage, so producers decided to change the character's surname to Katsopolis . To comply with child labor laws, twins Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley were cast to alternate in the role of Michelle during tapings. The girls were jointly credited as \"Mary Kate Ashley Olsen\" in seasons two through seven because the producers did not want audiences to know that the Michelle character was played by twins. The sisters occasionally appeared together in fantasy sequences. Full House was one of the few shows on TV where a baby character grew up in front of the cameras, with viewers witnessing all the development stages of the twin actresses. Saget recalled he would often get complaints from the child actors' moms because he wouldn't watch his language while on stage. Jodie Sweetin was spotted in a guest spot on the show Valerie. Lori Loughlin was hired in 1988 for a six-episode romance plot with \"Uncle Jesse\" but ended up staying until the end of the show.

O'Connor knew from the beginning that he wanted to cast Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks because he needed someone with an athletic background and a fiery passion for sports. The casting of the team consisted of real hockey players to give the film a raw and accurate feel. O'Connor figured it would be easier to teach hockey players to act than to teach actors to play hockey. On-ice tryouts were held in New York, Boston, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Vancouver. Another tryout was held in Vancouver for the Soviet and European teams. There are a total of 133 different hockey plays in the film. To accomplish this, the directors turned to ReelSports Solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, The Rookie. The ReelSports team referred to coach Herb Brooks for information on practices, plays, equipment, and uniform styles. Each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors' safety. Players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment. All of the locations of the real life hockey games are replicated by hockey arenas in British Columbia. The team tryouts, set in Colorado Springs, were filmed at the Queen's Park Arena in New Westminster. The team practices were filmed at the M.S.A. Arena in Abbotsford. The exhibition game in which the USA team lost to the USSR team at Madison Square Garden was filmed at the Pacific Coliseum, former home of the Vancouver Canucks. The Exhibition against Norway, the subsequent bag skate, and all Olympic game scenes were filmed at the PNE Agrodome. Al Michaels re-recorded most of his television commentary for the film.

John contacts Gale, recounting Bernie's tale of the rescue, and provides the single shoe to take credit for the selfless act. When Bernie tries to tell people that John is a fake, the media, after sensationalizing his heroic image, will not believe Bernie. Bernie is released from jail and his lawyer informed him that he will be heading to prison soon because of the stolen goods he carried in his apartment. Gale, as one of the crash survivors, considers herself to be in John's debt and soon grooms his public image. She finds herself falling in love with him even though she has questions about his authenticity. Despite his reluctant acceptance of his fame, he turns out to be a decent person, using his fame and reward money to help sick children and the homeless. John finds himself in an ethical dilemma since his persona is inspirational to countless people.

Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement. Exploiting his embellished frontier legend , Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\". In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign. At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy. On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\". As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South. Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln. As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000\u2013200,000 copies. Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War. Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. His victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Moving around a lot, Dawn's family does not provide much stability for her, but what her lifestyle lacks in stability, her home life makes up for in love. This erratic lifestyle seems to change when Dawn and Jimmy are able to enroll in an exclusive private school when Ormond gets a job there. It is here that Dawn's talent for singing is discovered. Her brother does not enjoy the school, feeling the weight of class differences bear down upon him. Dawn, although optimistic, does not fare much better, and is sternly ordered by the headmistress to be on her best behavior as she is of lesser social status than her classroom peers. On her first day, she also incurs the wrath of the most popular and affluent girl in the school, Clara Sue Cutler, after accidentally ratting her out on her smoking. Clara Sue then proceeds to pull mean-spirited pranks on Dawn and openly refers to her as white trash. Deeply offended, Dawn finally stops trying to like Clara Sue after this insult. However, Clara Sue's older brother, the handsome and charming Philip Cutler, does not share his sister's loathing. Phillip is kind to Dawn, and immediately shows an interest in her. He compares her beauty to that of his mother, Laura Sue Cutler, and is easily entranced. Jimmy is wary of Phillip, but does not overtly oppose Dawn's involvement with him. A shy girl who has had a sheltered upbringing, Dawn is somewhat taken aback by Phillip's immediate romantic overtures, even though she does find him attractive. Phillip urges her to date him, and after constant persuasion from him, Dawn agrees. Meanwhile, Dawn's mother, Sally Jean, has discovered that she is pregnant. This strains the Longchamps' finances, which are already tight, but Dawn is still overjoyed at the prospect of a little sibling, hoping that the baby will look more like her. Sally Jean gives birth to a little girl named Fern, but does not recover her health after the labor. She attempts several holistic ways of recovering her health but to no avail. She remains bedridden for the duration of Dawn's school year. At school, Dawn is excited by the musical opportunities now opening up to her. Her enjoyment of music culminates in her solo song, Somewhere over the Rainbow, at a school concert. Although nervous because of a prank pulled earlier by Clara Sue and her clique, Dawn draws emotional strength from the pearl necklace Sally Jean gave her earlier in the evening, which she claims are a Longchamp heirloom. Dawn's world comes crashing down after her solo performance at the school concert. Her beloved mother, Sally Jean, passes away that night. With the shock of this barely registered, what comes on the heels of Sally Jean's death truly changes Dawn's life forever. A security guard at the hospital where Sally Jean died recognizes the family, and also notices something peculiar in Dawn's appearance. He goes to the authorities, who perform an early morning raid of the Longchamp residence. Through these officers, it is revealed to Dawn that she is not Ormond and Sally Jean's biological daughter, but that she was kidnapped by them as a newborn baby, and that she is actually the daughter of Randolph and Laura Sue Cutler. Dawn is taken back to Cutler's Cove, Virginia, an offshoot of Virginia Beach. Ormond is arrested for child kidnapping. With no nearby relatives to come to their aid, Jimmy and Fern are placed in foster care. Dawn refuses to believe that Ormond kidnapped her, but the authorities prove her identity through a unique birthmark she shares with the description of the kidnapped baby. Dawn is appalled at the realization that the terrible Clara Sue is her sister; even worse, her boyfriend, Phillip, is actually her brother. These concerns fade into the background after her first meeting with Grandmother Cutler at the family's hotel, also named Cutler's Cove. Grandmother Cutler does not seem overjoyed about the return of her long-lost grandchild. She informs Dawn that she will be known by her \"true\" name, Eugenia, and that she will work in the hotel as a maid in order to prove that she is trustworthy. Dawn is shocked and upset by this cold treatment. She tries appealing to her real parents, Randolph and Laura Sue, but they are just as powerless as her. Randolph, though charming and handsome, has little willpower and prefers life to be as smooth as possible. Laura Sue is enchanted by Dawn's prettiness and resemblance to her, but refuses to make any effort to help her, as she is completely cowed by her mother-in-law. Dawn is also put at risk by Clara Sue's malicious tricks. Infuriated by Dawn's return, she does her best to make sure Dawn is fired by stealing jewellery and other items from the hotel guests. Dawn finds some comfort in the housekeeper, Mrs. Boston, who knew Sally Jean and Ormond Longchamp when they worked at the hotel. She cannot believe that her parents stole her, as they were always honest, hard-working people. Mrs. Boston hints that there is more to the \"kidnapping\" than meets the eye. Dawn's life is further brightened by a secret visit from Jimmy, aided and abetted by Phillip. Jimmy confesses that he has been in love with Dawn since they were children, but never dared show it because he felt he was sick for thinking of her that way. Dawn admits the attraction is mutual, but they find it hard to overcome their upbringing as brother and sister. This happy interlude comes to an end when Clara Sue finds Jimmy in the basement, where Dawn hid him.  She tells Grandmother Cutler, who goes to the police and has Jimmy taken back to his foster parents. Dawn is heart-broken that Jimmy has to leave and is furious with Clara Sue. Jealous of her obvious affection for Jimmy, Phillip corners Dawn in her bathroom and rapes her. Desperate to get out, Dawn visits Mrs. Dalton, the woman who took care of her just after she was born, and learns that her \"kidnapping\" was staged by Grandmother Cutler because she is not Randolph's biological daughter but a product of one of her mother's extramarital affairs. Grandmother Cutler did not want a non-Cutler child to grow up as part of the family, so she paid the Longchamps with family jewels, including the string of pearls, to keep them quiet and to provide for Dawn's future. Outraged, Dawn confronts Grandmother Cutler about this. The old woman eventually admits that she was behind the \"kidnapping\" and offers Dawn a deal: if Dawn will study singing in New York, Grandmother Cutler will use her influence to have Ormond released prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Due to the economy, they could not make the film that year. They were then inspired by the concept of Buy Nothing Day, an international day of protest against consumerism, and decided to experience a Buy Nothing summer. They spent two months in 2009 with proponents of freeganism, which is a practice of eating \"discarded food in their pursuit of a moneyless existence\". Marling said, \"We wanted to have some adventure, and we didn't have any money. We learned to hop trains, we learned to sleep on rooftops, we learned to claim the space that feels so private. We joined this anarchist collective.\" The pair drew from their experiences as well as thriller films like All The President's Men, The Bourne Identity and Michael Clayton to craft The East, which they wrote before they began filming Sound of My Voice for a 2011 release. Batmanglij and Marling wrote to have the anarchist organization target a multinational corporation instead of a government. Marling said, \"Multinational corporations are outside of the purview of any nation-state. These are the entities that are shaping and running the world... The modern anarchy movement is about rebelling against the corporate structure.\" Batmanglij said the film focused on the pharmaceutical industry due to the writers hearing stories about the side effects of drugs, such as a drug to help quit smoking that resulted in some people committing suicide. He said they considered focusing on banks due to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, but they chose the pharmaceutical industry so the mission in the film would have emotional resonance. They titled the film The East to make a variety of references. The director explained, \"'The East' is ... the East Coast, which is like something in our American collective consciousness\u2014New England, tony, center of power. The Wicked Witch of the East in the Oz mythology was the bad witch because the book was about how the Midwest was getting screwed over by the east, by Washington. And then of course we have the Middle East or the Far East, which is seen as different or other. The ultimate Other. So, it's funny that this word means two things, and I thought that was an interesting name for a resistance group that is combined of kids from New England who want to make themselves the Other.\" Sound of My Voice, directed by Batmanglij and starring Marling, screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in January. Producer Michael Costigan, who liked Sound of My Voice, got a copy of the screenplay for The East. Costigan liked the screenplay and approached Batmanglij to say that he and his fellow producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott at Scott Free Productions were interested in making the film. After the festival, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired distribution rights for Sound of My Voice and Another Earth . In the process, the distributor greenlighted production of The East. By September 2011, Marling and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd were cast in the starring roles. Felicity Jones was attached to play Izzy, but she dropped out to promote Like Crazy. Jones was replaced by Elliot Page. Production of the film, which had a budget of , took place in Shreveport, Louisiana. Production designer Alex DiGerlando converted an alternative lifestyle club in Shreveport into a house for The East. The club was originally painted black and gold, and it was repainted different shades of green for the film. Filming took place in late 2011; Batmanglij said it lasted . The director compared the film's ambivalent ending to the one in the 2002 film 25th Hour: \"I feel like it's almost as if the film\u2019s events never happened at its end...

At the meeting with King Francis of France, Henry meets Anne Boleyn and immediately becomes smitten with her.  Having failed to produce a male heir with his wife Catherine , Henry considers divorcing her and marrying Anne.  Henry's court astrologer Comus, along with Will Somers, Mark Smeaton and Cardinal Wolsey humorously lament Henry's notorious wandering eye in \u201cThe Chase\u201d leaving Henry to pluck the petals from a daisy to prophesize the outcome of his desire for Anne.  Catherine refuses to grant Henry a divorce, so Henry founds the Church of England, and thus divorces and banishes Catherine.  Passionately in love, Henry and Anne admit that they cannot bear to be \u201cAway From You\u201d, but after their marriage, things sour when Anne gives birth, not to a son, but to daughter \u201cElizabeth.\u201d  Things become further strained as Anne becomes intrigued with Mark Smeaton, and Henry with Jane Seymour, one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting.  Charges of treason against Anne and Smeaton are laid and they are found guilty.  Shortly before her execution, Anne and Henry reflect on their time together, \u201cSo Much You Loved Me.\u201d  Will promises Anne that he will look after Elizabeth.  Henry marries Jane Seymour and they have a son together, Edward, but Jane dies in childbirth, leaving Henry conflicted as he rejoices in the arrival of his son, but questioning his methods in this pursuit.

The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were \"incredibly polite\". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a doctor character who would actually say that Shore was wasting the hospital's time. A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation . The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained that he did not want the character to be that young.

These stories were then combined and given to the episode writer. This system allowed every writer to contribute to every episode, and enabled the writing team to finish scripts sooner, so the filming crew could shoot more scenes at a location. Kring described the writing process as a collaborative one and stated that the collaboration process was important because production needed to shoot several scenes at a single location. To do this, several scripts had to be ready. Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explained that this process was important in a serialized drama because one has to know where each character's development is heading. Season two coincided with the WGA writers' strike, meaning only 11 out of the planned 24 episodes were produced. That forced the producers to redesign the season to encompass only the Generations volume out of the three planned. The planned third volume, Exodus, which was originally designed to be a story arc reflecting the effects of the release of strain 138 of the Shanti virus, was cancelled. The planned fourth volume, Villains, was changed to the third volume and moved into season three. Scenes from the volume two finale, \"Powerless\", were reshot to reflect the cancelation of the Exodus volume, and to tie up all the loose plot storylines of Generations. Following criticisms of the second and third volumes, Tim Molloy from TV Guide reported that Heroes would return to its roots with the fourth volume, Fugitives, to attract new viewers and regain those who gave up on the show because of too many characters and plotlines. In November 2008, NBC fired Jesse Alexander and Jeph Loeb from the production staff of Heroes over creative differences and budget problems. As a result, Kring would refocus the series on character development and simple storytelling. However, a high-ranking insider told TV Guide that rather than pressure from NBC or Universal Media responding to recent plummeting ratings, it was Kring himself who fired Alexander and Loeb because the duo refused to continue character-driven stories that made the first season popular from the start. In December 2008, Bryan Fuller signed a 2-year deal with Universal Media Studios after the cancellation of his ABC series Pushing Daisies. He rejoined the writing staff of Heroes starting with the 20th episode of season three and had a \"key role in the writing and direction\" of the series.

In the story, the man owns a shop where he has such a machine and then gives people what they need to provide the best possible outcomes; also, the Renard character is killed not by a car but by falling off a subway platform while a train is coming into the station. This version of the story aired on a 1952 episode of the anthology series Tales of Tomorrow, changing the death of the Renard character from a fall to being hit by a car. For his version, Serling replaced the science-fiction element with a street peddler who could magically perform the same function. The final shot before the first commercial is actually played backwards; looking carefully, one can see smoke returning to Renard's cigarette. During the scene in Mr. Renard's hotel room, a bellhop brings him a newspaper. Renard then opens it and spreads it out on the floor.

The film had at least five title changes, including Last River to Cross. John Milius became attached to the producer. The script was rewritten by Joe Gayton. Hauser lost credit in arbitration.

Kotcheff said \"We assiduously avoided anything in our story similar to Gritz. Our research amazingly showed there were some 30 groups training for similar missions.\" Kotcheff said that Milius did write \"two or three scenes\" as well as making \"a number of very creative suggestions\" on the script. Among the scenes Milius wrote included one where Hackman gives a speech to the other soldiers about Vietnam being like a company that has gone bankrupt. \"It was a wonderful speech,\" said Kotcheff, adding Milius \"did write under pressure but mainly he functioned as a producer.\" Milius said he wanted James Arness to play the lead role rather than Gene Hackman.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On Headless Cross, Tony [Martin] had just come into the band and he assumed, oh, Black Sabbath, it's all about the Devil, so his lyrics were full of the Devil and Satan. It was too much in your face. We told him to be a bit more subtle about it, so for Tyr he did all these lyrics about Nordic gods and whatnot. It took me a while to get my head around that.\" This album represents possibly the most dramatic departure from Black Sabbath's traditional sound, with only traces of it found in the occasional riff. The production has been criticised by some and praised by others, who note that this is one of Sabbath's heaviest albums and perhaps the most prominently reliant on keyboards by the perennial fifth member, Geoff Nicholls. As a result, much of the music is a lot darker than previous Sabbath works, closely resembling the previous album Headless Cross. The band have stated that while they do not disown or regret the song \"Feels Good to Me\", it was put on the album solely to be released as a single and does not fit in musically with the rest of the record. Geezer Butler, Ian Gillan and Brian May made guest appearances on the European leg of the Tyr tour; Butler and May appearing during the encore of the show performed on 8 September 1990 at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.

The series was then renewed for first-run syndication, and four additional seasons were produced. Returning cast members from the film included Lee Curreri, Albert Hague, Gene Anthony Ray and Debbie Allen. The show's popularity, particularly in the United Kingdom, led to the formation of a music group, The Kids from \"Fame\". The main vocalists were Allen, Ray, Curerri, Valerie Landsburg, Erica Gimpel, Carlo Imperato, and Lori Singer. In 1982, the band released two albums, The Kids from \"Fame\" and The Kids from \"Fame\" Again, which were largely successful in the United Kingdom. The band members also went on tour, performing as their characters live on stage. After the series was renewed, The Kids from \"Fame\" produced three additional albums, all of which proved less successful and resulted in the band members parting ways to pursue other projects. In 1987, producer David De Silva announced he was developing a stage version of the film. Fame \u2013 the Musical was the first professional production at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami in 1988. The show then played at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia from March 25 through April 29, 1989. The musical has since been produced in over 25 countries. In 1997, MGM Television produced a second series inspired by the film. Fame L.A., created by Richard B. Lewis, focused on the lives of several students attending a drama and dance school in Los Angeles. The series featured Christian Kane, Roselyn S\u00e1nchez, William R. Moses, and Lesli Margherita in starring roles. It aired in syndication from October 19, 1997 to March 21, 1998. In 2002, MGM and Touchstone Television planned to develop a two-hour television film that would serve as a direct sequel to Fame, followed by a spin-off television series. Both projects were to be produced for the ABC network. The television film was to introduce several students applying for positions at the New York City of Performing Arts, while the spin-off series would focus on their lives during their four years of attending the school. The series would feature new cast members as the young students, as well as those from the 1980 film, as well as updated versions of the songs \"Fame\" and \"Out Here on My Own\". Michael Gore was to act as an executive producer for both projects with his producing partner Lawrence Cohen, through their production label White Cap Productions. However, both television projects were never produced. In 2003, MGM Television produced a reality television series titled Fame, in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the largely popular American Idol. The concept of the series involves discovering a \"triple threat\"\u2014a person who can sing, act and dance and has a \"bigger-than-life\" personality. The show, co-hosted by Debbie Allen, and Joey Fatone, featured Carnie Wilson, Johnny Wright and JoJo Wright as the panel of judges. The series premiered on NBC on May 28, 2003, and a total of ten episode were produced. The two competing finalists of the series were Shannon Bex and Harlemm Lee. Lee emerged as the winner of the competition, based on home-audience votes. In 2012, MGM Television announced it would produce a modern-day television series inspired by the film, with Nigel Lythgoe acting as an executive producer. The project resurfaced in June 2015, when The Hollywood Reporter announced that MGM Television would be co-producing the series with A&E Networks for Lifetime, with Josh Safran attached as the show's writer and executive producer.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Peart, \"We laid out no parameters, no goals, no limitations, only that we would take a relaxed, civilized approach to the project.\" With the help of producer Paul Northfield, the band produced seventy-four minutes of music for their new album Vapor Trails, which was written and recorded in Toronto. Vapor Trails marked the first Rush studio recording to not include any keyboards or synthesizers since Caress of Steel. According to the band, the album's developmental process was extremely taxing and took approximately 14 months to finish, the longest they had ever spent writing and recording a studio album. Vapor Trails was released on May 14, 2002; to herald the band's comeback, the single and lead track from the album, \"One Little Victory\", was designed to grab the attention of listeners with its rapid guitar and drum tempos. The album was supported by the band's first tour in six years, including first-ever concerts in Brazil and Mexico City, where they played to some of the largest crowds of their career. The largest was a capacity of 60,000 in S\u00e3o Paulo. Vapour Trails peaked at No. 3 in Canada and No. 6 in the US, while selling disappointingly in the UK where it peaked at No.38. A live album and DVD, Rush in Rio, was released in October 2003 featuring the last performance of the band's Vapor Trails Tour on November 23, 2002, at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. To celebrate the band's 30th anniversary, June 2004 saw the release of Feedback, an extended play recorded in suburban Toronto featuring eight covers of such artists as Cream, The Who and The Yardbirds, bands the members of Rush cite as inspiration around the time of their inception. To help support Feedback and continue celebrating their 30th anniversary as a band, Rush launched the 30th Anniversary Tour in the summer of 2004, playing dates in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. On September 24, 2004, the concert at The Festhalle in Frankfurt, Germany was filmed for a DVD titled R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour, which was released on November 22, 2005. This release omitted eight songs also included on Rush in Rio; the complete concert was released on Blu-ray on December 8, 2009. During promotional interviews for the R30 DVD, the band members revealed their intention to begin writing new material in early 2006. While in Toronto, Lifeson and Lee began the songwriting process in January 2006. During this time, Peart assumed his role of lyric writing while residing in Southern California. The following September, Rush chose to hire American producer Nick Raskulinecz to co-produce the album. The band officially entered Allaire Studios in Shokan, New York in November 2006 to record the bulk of the material. Taking the band five weeks, the sessions ended in December. On February 14, 2007, an announcement was made on the official Rush website that the title of the new album would be Snakes & Arrows. The first single, entitled \"Far Cry\", was released to North American radio stations on March 12, 2007, and reached No. 2 on the Mediabase Mainstream and Radio and Records Charts. The Rush website, newly redesigned on March 12, 2007, to support the new album, also announced the band would embark on a tour to begin in the summer. Snakes & Arrows was released on May 1, 2007, in North America, where it debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 with approximately 93,000 units sold in its first week. It also peaked at No. 3 in Canada and No. 13 in the UK, selling an estimated 611,000 copies worldwide. To coincide with the beginning of Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, \"Spindrift\" was released as the official second radio single on June 1, 2007, while \"The Larger Bowl \" saw single status on June 25, 2007. \"The Larger Bowl\" peaked within the top 20 of both the Billboard Mainstream Rock and Media Base Mainstream charts, but \"Spindrift\" failed to appear on any commercial chart. The planned intercontinental tour in support of Snakes & Arrows began on June 13, 2007, in Atlanta, Georgia, coming to a close on October 29, 2007, at Hartwall Arena in Helsinki, Finland. The 2008 portion of the Snakes & Arrows tour began on April 11, 2008, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, at Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, and concluded on July 24, 2008, in Noblesville, Indiana at the Verizon Wireless Music Center.

Their parents had immigrated from Russia around the same time and they lived in the same New York City brownstone building. Kaye was a few years older than Mirrow and encouraged her to train. Nora Kaye was in a relationship with Jerome Robbins in the early 1950s, but they never married, focusing on their careers instead. Robbins was also a known bisexual. Isabel Mirrow danced with American Ballet Theatre from 1947 until 1953. Nora was with the company from its inception in 1939 until 1951, and later returned in a leadership role. Unlike in the film, Isabel did not get pregnant while she was with the company; however, during this time Isabel married fellow dancer Kelly Brown, who was widely sought after. Lucia Chase was the head of the company when Isabel and Nora were there. Kaye continued to dance in New York with other companies and became a more prominent figure in the ballet world, while Isabel had stopped performing to marry and have children. Their first child, Leslie Browne, born in 1957, was Nora Kaye's goddaughter. Kaye went on to marry director Herbert Ross in 1959. The two couples were close friends, along with Arthur Laurents. Kelly Brown, Ross, Kaye, and Laurents all worked together in the Broadway musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale in 1962. In his autobiography, Laurents wrote that in the 1940s he had a sexual relationship with Nora Kaye. In 1965, an opportunity to run a dance studio opened up, and Kelly Brown decided to move his family to Phoenix, Arizona . By this time he and his wife had aged out of performing. Isabel Mirrow Brown was not thrilled to leave her native New York for Arizona, and the move caused strain in their marriage. When their daughter Leslie auditioned and was accepted to train back in New York in the School of American Ballet , Isabel moved back to New York to watch over Leslie, who was still a teenager. The film depicts Isabel's experience entering back into the dance world after living in Phoenix and having four children . In real life she eventually divorced Kelly Brown, who died in 1981 at age 52. While in Arizona the Browns had kept in touch with their friends Nora and Herbert. Later in the mid 1970s, a script based on the Brown family was developed by Arthur Laurents. Ross directed the film and co-produced with his wife. Ross, Laurents, and Kaye never had children and took a special interest in Leslie Browne as she grew older. The script was a fictionalized version of the Browns' life and the long friendship between Isabel and Nora. The fictional parts primarily concern the character Yuri, who was created as a love interest for Emilia. Originally, the ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, who was at the height of her fame at the time and dating Mikhail Baryshnikov , was offered the role of Emilia. She rejected the role as she was dealing with substance abuse issues at the time and she \"wanted no part of Hollywood\". Ross then decided that Leslie Browne, who was nineteen at the time, would be able to portray a fictionalized version of herself in the film. In real life, Leslie had just joined ABT in 1976 and was experiencing the same things she portrayed on screen. Leslie had added an \"e\" to her last name as her stage name to sound more feminine after being mistaken as a man in a playbill. The script changed the family name from Brown to Rodgers, and all the first names except for their son Ethan Brown. The real-life Ethan Brown later became a soloist with American Ballet Theatre, retiring from performing in 2004; he now teaches. In real life, the Browns had another son, Kelly Brown II, who danced as a child but did not train professionally like his siblings and later became a film producer. Their other daughter, Elizabeth Brown , was also a dancer, unlike in the film, and was accepted into SAB a year after Leslie. Nora Kaye died of cancer in 1987 at age 67. After the film, Leslie Browne went on to become a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre in New York City from 1986 until 1993 and now teaches ballet. Her mother Isabel continued to be associated with New York ballet and died in August 2014 at the age of 86. Herbert Ross later directed two more dance-themed films, Nijinsky and Dancers , both of which also feature Leslie Browne. Arthur Laurents claimed an important subplot regarding Wayne's homosexuality in the original script was cut from the film by Herbert Ross and his wife. This was the reason why Wayne's character's development does not progress steadily throughout the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Her name is Princess Odette, and three years prior she was kidnapped by the evil sorcerer Rothbart who wanted her hand in marriage. Rothbart cursed her to be a swan by day so that no one will fall in love with her, as the only way Rothbart's power can be defeated is when a man loves her with all his heart and soul.

After a long fight with Rothbart, the sorcerer has Siegfried cornered and held at sword-point. To save his life, Odette promises to Rothbart that she will love and marry him, but Siegfried, unable to bear the thought of Odette being a prisoner to Rothbart forever, grabs and plunges the sword into his own heart and causes a flash of yellow light which obliterates both Rothbart and Odille. Consequently, all of Rothbart's magic is undone: His castle collapses, Adolf transforms back into a human, Hans and Margarita are reunited, and Odette's curse is broken. Odette and Siegfried, who survive the castle's collapse, reunite and run into each other's arms.

Meanwhile, a witch appears at the bakery revealing to the baker and his wife that they are infertile because of a spell she placed on the baker's father many years ago. She explains that his father stole vegetables from the Witch's garden to appease his wife's appetite as she was pregnant. As he was leaving, he stole some beans for himself that he did not realize were magic. When they were taken from the garden, the Witch lost her beauty. In return, she stole their daughter Rapunzel and caused the spell over their family. She explains that the only way to lift the spell is to find four ingredients in the woods: a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold and bring them to her before three days is up. As Cinderella's step-family prepares to leave for the festival, they once again refuse Cinderella's wish to go with them. As he is preparing to leave, the Baker finds six magic beans in his father's old jacket. All begin their journeys into the woods: Jack to sell his beloved cow; Cinderella to seek advice from her mother's grave; Little Red to her grandmother's house; and the Baker, refusing his Wife's help, to find the ingredients . When she gets to her mother's grave, Cinderella repeats her wish to attend the festival and the spirit of her mother gifts her with a gown and golden slippers . A Mysterious Man mocks Jack for valuing his cow more than a \"sack of beans\". Little Red meets a hungry Wolf who distracts her from her path, hatching a plan to eat both her and her grandmother . The Baker, secretly followed by his Wife, meets Jack. Together, they convince Jack that the beans found in the jacket are magic, trade them for the cow and Jack bids Milky White a tearful farewell . The Baker feels guilty about their deceit, but his wife reassures him that it will pay off when they get their child . It is revealed that the Witch has raised Rapunzel in a tall tower, only accessible by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair ; a Prince spies Rapunzel and plans to meet her. When the Baker passes by Little Red's grandmother's house, he finds that the Wolf has eaten them both. In pursuit of her red cape, he stabs the Wolf and rescues Little Red and her grandmother. In return, Little Red gives him her cape, and reflects on her experiences . When Jack's Mother sees the exchange Jack has made for Milky White, she angrily tosses his beans aside, which grow into an enormous stalk. Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another Prince, and the Baker's Wife helps to hide her. When asked about the ball, Cinderella is unimpressed . Spotting Cinderella's gold slippers, the Baker's Wife chases her and loses Milky White as a clock chimes twelve times . Jack describes his adventure climbing the beanstalk and gives the Baker gold he stole from the giants to buy back his cow. The Baker is hesitant about selling so Jack returns up the beanstalk to find more. The Mysterious Man questions what the Baker cares more about, the money or his child, and takes the money. Cinderella's Prince and Rapunzel's Prince lament over their loves and the Baker's Wife overhears their talk of a girl with golden hair. As she takes hair from Rapunzel, the Baker finds Milky White, aided by the Mysterious Man. The Baker admits they must work together and they hatch a plan to finally seize Cinderella's slipper . Jack arrives with a golden egg as more money for the Baker but Milky White dies as midnight chimes . The Witch discovers the Prince's visits and demands Rapunzel stay sheltered from the world . Rapunzel refuses, and the Witch cuts off her hair, banishing her to a desert. Jack meets Little Red, now sporting a wolf skin cape and knife. He brags about his adventures in the sky, and mentions a golden harp owned by the Giant. She skeptically goads him into returning to the Giant's home to retrieve it. Cinderella, torn between staying with her Prince or escaping, leaves him one of her slippers, putting the decision into his hands , and trades shoes with the Baker's Wife for the last magic bean, though she throws it away in the process. The Baker arrives with another cow and they rejoice over having all four objects, however, the Witch discovers that the Baker has covered a cow in flour to make it appear white. The Witch resurrects Milky White and Jack returns with the harp. A great crash is heard, and Jack's mother reports a dead Giant in her backyard, though no one pays attention. The Witch instructs the Baker to feed the objects to Milky White, though no milk is produced. The Witch learns that the hair is Rapunzel's and will not work because she had touched it. When the Mysterious Man proposes using corn silk instead, Milky White produces the potion and the Witch drinks it, making her young and beautiful once again. She also reveals that the Mysterious Man is the Baker's father, though he dies as soon as she drinks the potion. Cinderella's Prince seeks the girl who fits the slipper and the desperate stepsisters mutilate their feet, though the Prince sees through it, eventually seeing Cinderella and realizing that she is the one . Rapunzel is found by her Prince and as the Witch attempts to curse her, she realizes that in exchange for her beauty, she has lost her powers. At Cinderella's wedding, her stepsisters are blinded by birds, and the Baker's Wife, now pregnant, thanks Cinderella for her help. Congratulating themselves on living happily , the characters fail to notice another beanstalk growing.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_269", "question": "Who was the producer of Smart People?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_74621", "text": "To \"sign off\" the series, the producers considered that they could \"blow everything up\" but ruled that out because they wanted to do something that \"celebrated what The Bill has always been about which is ordinary people wearing a uniform and taking responsibility for society\". The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that \"life goes on\" and end the series with \"their heads held high\". In the finale, Callum Stone has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding. The idea for the series finale came after research showed that rape is used to punish girl gang members. Series Producer Tim Key says \"That is what The Bill has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and we wanted it to be like that right up until the final shot.\" The final location shoot for the finale was carried out at a derelict estate in London which is due to be demolished.  The Bill was always filmed on location in London whenever possible, \"to keep the show authentic\".  Executive Producer Johnathan Young says \"We feel that London is a part of the show, it's a character within the show and we've really encouraged directors to look for graphic locations that give you a real sense of being part of a big metropolis\".  Examples of these would include police chases by boat along the River Thames and helicopters aiding searches. The police uniforms used in The Bill are authentic so when not in use they are locked away.  The uniforms were originally bought from the police who agreed to buy the uniforms back when the series ended. The final scene was a long take, filmed using a hand-held camera and featured 70 people in total.  Of the final scene, Keys said that the producers knew they had to do \"something special\" but also wanted to show that \"life goes on\".  To film the final scene, the cameraman had to keep the camera steady when following the characters going through the police station and then outside into the rear yard of the station where he stepped into a crane which then lifts to reveal the front of Sun Hill station. The shows producers were also included in the final scene, and played the part of journalists at the press conference hosted by Jack Meadows which Keys described as being \"eerie\" because \"you were sat there on the front row listening to Simon making a very moving speech that sums up the show and his time in it\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to the fictional universe first established by Buffy, the 'Buffyverse', Angel was born in 18th-century Ireland; after being turned into a soulless, immortal vampire, he became legendary for his evil acts, until a band of wronged Gypsies punished him by restoring his soul, overwhelming him with guilt. Angel eventually set out on a path of redemption, hoping that he could make up for his past through good deeds. In Buffy's Season Three finale, he leaves Sunnydale for L.A. to continue his atonement without Buffy. Whedon believed that \"Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was, a kind of superhero.\" Whedon has compared the series to its parent: \"It's a little bit more straightforward action show and a little bit more of a guys' show.\" While the central concept behind Buffy was \"high school as a horror movie\" in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make Angel into a different \"gritty, urban show.\" Whedon explained, \"We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles because there are a lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's those two things that creatively make the shows different.\" Whedon and Greenwalt prepared a six-minute promotional video pitch, often called the \"Unaired Angel pilot\" for the WB Network. Some shots from this short were later used in the opening credits. Early during the life of the series, some effort was made to slightly soften the original concept. For example, scenes were cut from the pilot episode, \"City of,\" in which Angel tasted the blood of a murder victim; the episode that was originally written to be the second episode, \"Corrupt\", was abandoned altogether. Writer David Fury explained, \"The network was shocked. They said 'We can't shoot this. This is way too dark.' We were able to break a new idea, we had to turn it over in three days.\" Instead, the tone was lightened and the opening episodes established Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation. A first draft script reveals that Angel was originally intended to include the character Whistler, played by Max Perlich, who had already been featured in two Buffy episodes, \"Becoming, Part One\" and \"Part Two\". In an interview, Perlich said, \"I never got called again. If they had called, I would have probably accepted because it was a great experience and I think Joss is very original and talented.\" Instead, the producers created a Whistler-like character, Doyle. Cordelia Chase, also from the original Sunnydale crew, joined Angel and Doyle.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The first known use of the phrase \"the catholic church\" occurred in the letter written about 110 AD from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans. In the Catechetical Lectures of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, the name \"Catholic Church\" was used to distinguish it from other groups that also called themselves \"the church\". The \"Catholic\" notion was further stressed in the edict De fide Catolica issued 380 by Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire, when establishing the state church of the Roman Empire. Since the East\u2013West Schism of 1054, the Eastern Church has taken the adjective \"Orthodox\" as its distinctive epithet and the Western Church in communion with the Holy See has similarly taken \"Catholic\", keeping that description also after the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, when those who ceased to be in communion became known as \"Protestants\". While the \"Roman Church\" has been used to describe the pope's Diocese of Rome since the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and into the Early Middle Ages , the \"Roman Catholic Church\" has been applied to the whole church in the English language since the Protestant Reformation in the late 16th century. \"Roman Catholic\" has occasionally appeared also in documents produced both by the Holy See, and notably used by certain national episcopal conferences and local dioceses.

Its lyrics were written primarily by John Lennon, credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney, who later disagreed over the extent of their contributions to the song. Lennon credited the harmony and bridge to McCartney, while McCartney claimed the entire musical structure. George Martin contributed the piano solo bridge, which was sped up to sound like a harpsichord. According to Lennon, \"In My Life\" was his \"first real major piece of work\" because it was the first time he penned personal lyrics about his own life. The original version of the lyrics was based on a bus route he used to take in Liverpool, naming various sites seen along the way, including Penny Lane and Strawberry Field. Lennon discarded this lyrical idea in favour of a more generalized meditation on his past. He and McCartney later revisited those original references with their respective songs \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\". Despite not actually containing a harpsichord, \"In My Life\" inspired more pop music producers to use the instrument in their arrangements. In 2000, Mojo named \"In My Life\" the best song of all time.  Rolling Stone ranked it number 23 on its 2004 list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and number 98 on the 2021 revised list, as well as fifth on its list of the Beatles' \"100 Greatest Songs\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

Xar assigns Haplo to take Bane back to the air world Arianus, where Haplo will reactivate a city-sized machine called the Kicksey-winsey, which has stopped for the first time in history. Haplo contemplates returning to the Labyrinth, the prison world of his people, the Patryn, but is intercepted by Zifnab, a Sartan. Sartans are the enemies of the Patryns; despite this, Haplo warns Zifnab to leave before Xar finds him. Bane informs Xar of this conversation and is ordered to kill Haplo for his betrayal. Limbeck, the leader of a dwarf rebellion, enlists Haplo's help in reactivating the machine. Haplo, Bane, Limbeck, and Limbeck's wife Jarre must sneak through the elven base in the Factree to reach the machine's center. Haplo, Bane, and Jarre are separated from Limbeck and captured by red-eyed elves led by Sang-drax. Limbeck finds a room where members of all races sit peacefully together, but have frightening red eyes. He overhears elves discussing Sang-drax taking Jarre to his dragonship and plots to rescue her. Haplo and Bane are taken to the elven Emperor, Agah'ran. Agah'ran is simultaneously fighting wars with humans, Gegs, and his own rebellious son. He plots with Bane to end the human war by assassinating Bane's adoptive parents, the human monarchs Stephen and Anne. Stephen, Anne, and Bane's true mother Lady Iridal learn that the elves are holding Bane captive. The three do not want to rescue Bane, who is publicly charming but privately a power-hungry villain, but realize it would look strange if they failed to attempt to rescue him. Iridal decides to rescue Bane personally with the help of the retired assassin Hugh. He is persuaded to attempt to carry out a previous contract to kill Bane. At the elven capitol, Hugh and Iridal seek help from a religious clan of elven mages, the Keepers of the Cathedral. Hugh pledges his soul to them in exchange. They slip into the Emperor's palace, where Iridal falls into a trap. In exchange for her life, Hugh agrees to kill the human monarchs for Bane. Haplo is taken by the dragon-snakes and mentally tortured, but is rescued by the Keepers. The Keepers give Haplo a book written in every language, which will help him reactivate the Kicksey-winsey, and send him back to the surface. Iridal goes with him to stop Hugh and Bane.

He turned the role down, finding it awkward to play his father, and too strange to approach the romance between his parents. The role went to Jason Scott Lee , who said he was initially intimidated by his role as Bruce Lee but that he overcame his fear after speaking to Brandon. According to Jason, Brandon told him the following in regards to the role: \"He said I wouldn't survive in this part if I treated his father like a god. He said his father was, after all, a man who had a profound destiny, but he was not a god. He was a man who had a temper, a lot of anger, who found mediocrity offensive. Sometimes he was rather merciless.\" Director Rob Cohen said he spent hours talking to Brandon during preparations. On August 23, 1991, Mark L. Lester's Showdown in Little Tokyo premiered, which Warner Bros. produced and distributed. Lee starred opposite Dolph Lundgren in the buddy cop action film. Lee secured his role on October 13, 1990, to make his American feature. It was meant to start shooting after his casting but was delayed until the following January. In the film, Lee and Lundgren play cops who are partnered to investigate yakuzas. In the US, the domestic gross was $2,275,557. The movie faced largely negative reviews; retrospectively, however, some critics find it entertaining for its genre. While visiting Sweden, Lee was among the cameos in the locally made genre film Sex, L\u00f6gner och Videov\u00e5ld , filmed between 1990 and 1993. The film was completed in 2000. Lee's next film was 20th Century Fox's Rapid Fire, which premiered on August 22, 1992, and was directed by Dwight H. Little. Lee plays a student named Jake Lo who witnesses a murder and is put in a witness protection program. The film came about when producer Robert Lawrence started working with Lee and noticed his potential to be an action leading man in Hollywood after screening Lee's earlier project Legacy of Rage. Lee was involved with the story development, and connected with the plot point where his character loses his father. Jeff Imada, the film's stunt coordinator, witnessed Lee bringing a book of work by his father to emotionally prepare himself in the scene where the character loses his dad. Imada also said Lee put on muscle for the role. Lee and Imada are credited for the fight choreography, the fighting style contain elements of Lee father's Jeet Kune Do. Lee was allowed to add some touches of his own humor to the script. On playing the character of Jake Lo, Lee said \"I always saw that character as not being gung-ho to get himself involved in those situations. I wanted to keep that throughout the film, that sarcastic edge. So he's not just becoming Joe Action Hero.\" In the US, the film is debuted at No.3 at the box office, making $4,815,850. After its 19 weeks run in cinemas, it made a total of $14,356,479. Most critics did not like the film, but many of them found Lee charismatic. A minority of critics found Rapid Fire to be slick, well acted, and a serviceable action film. Also that year, it was reported that Lee signed a three-picture deal with 20th Century Fox and a multi-picture deal with Carolco Pictures. That year, according to John Lee Hancock, Lee read the first draft of The Little Things . In the fall, while doing publicity for Rapid Fire, Lee landed the lead role in the Alex Proyas' The Crow, an adaptation of a comic book by the same name. It tells the story of Eric Draven , a rock musician raised from the dead by a supernatural crow to avenge his own death as well as the rape and murder of his fianc\u00e9e by a dangerous gang in his city. According to producer Jeff Most, Lee had good insight on the character and liked the lyrical lines within the script, but did not want the dialogue to spread aimlessly. Hence, Lee focused on the brevity and rhythm of the lines of dialogue to make the character threatening. In preparation for the fight sequence, Most said that director Proyas and Lee studied martial arts movies. Also according to Most, Lee did not want metaphysical characters besides his own in the film. Costumer Roberta Bile said that Lee modelled Draven after singer Chris Robinson. Lee convinced the team to hire Jeff Imada who became the stunt coordinator; he and Imada oversaw the fight choreography. Imada and Lee agreed that the character of Eric Draven would not do conventional martial arts moves; his movements would be unique, as he is a character without formal martial arts training who was given supernatural abilities upon resurrection. With this in mind, they added aerobics to Draven's fighting style. Both Imada and Most said Lee was pleased to incorporate his martial arts to the design of the character, without it being part of the story. Imada said that in order to look like a rocker and not an action hero, Lee went on a strict diet weeks before shooting in order to remove a lot of bulk, and would even weigh the food he ate. Lee also focused on cardiovascular exercise with a stairmaster, did repetitions on lighter weights to elongate and stretch his muscles, and did aerobics to lose body fat rapidly. During pre-production, Imada said that in order to get into character for the resurrection, Lee bought bags of ice in which he submerged himself, because Lee hypothesized that the feeling of resurrection must be freezing cold. The resurrection scene was shot the first night of production, during the winter. Imada was surprised that Lee requested the bags of ice because of the weather, and the fact that he was already barefoot and bare-naked. Key hairstylist Michelle Johnson said that in rain scenes Lee would soak himself prior to filming the scenes, where he would act without a shirt in cold weather. The film crew was impressed with his performance and dedication. On March 31, 1993, while filming The Crow, Lee was accidentally wounded on set by defective blank ammunition and later died in hospital during surgery.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mei discovers that she has been accepted at a different university than her boyfriend Justin Wexler , and worries about telling him as prom approaches. Lucas Arnaz has long been in love with his lab partner Simone , and turns to his friend Corey Doyle to help him ask her to the prom. The only one who does not care about the prom is Jesse Richter . He works at a local market, stocking shelves; plays truant, rides his motorcycle across the schoolyard, and behaves inappropriately. Principal Dunnan tries to talk, but does not get through to him. Meanwhile, Jordan Lundley finds an earring in her boyfriend's car, Tyler Barso but he assures her that he's not cheating. To show his love, he takes her on a romantic date in the shed where the prom decorations were stored; Tyler forgot to extinguish one candle before they left, and the shed and everything in it was burned down. With only 3 weeks left, Nova is left to manufacture replacement props alone . The principal, annoyed at Jesse's lack of respect, warms him about a choice: either he helps Nova with the rebuild, or he can't graduate. Jesse accepts reluctantly, as does Nova; and realize they need each other's cooperation. While Brandon disappoints Nova by not asking her to the prom, she and Jesse grow closer, despite the fact that he finds the idea of prom ridiculous. When Nova discovers that the prom theme of the neighboring school is the same as theirs, Jesse decides to sneak into their school to check it out. However the security guard notices them and the police catch them after they escape.  The police call Nova's parents, and when Nova's father arrives he snaps at Jesse. Meanwhile, Lloyd still cannot find a date and becomes frustrated. Lucas asks Simone to a barbecue hosted by his friend Tyler. Tyler tries to talk and flirt with her but she rejects him, because he is dating Jordan. Meanwhile, the stress in Mei and Justin's relationship reaches its breaking point, and Mei cancels on Justin for fear of telling him about her acceptance. At school, Lucas blows off Corey to spend more time with Simone, and invites her to study for the upcoming test with him. However, en route to the library, Simone is stopped by Tyler, who convinces her to talk with him about his feelings. Jordan sees the two talking and immediately realizes the situation. After school, Nova apologizes to Jesse for her father\u2019s behavior. Later, she brings him along as she goes dress shopping, for a second opinion. Back at school, Simone apologizes to Lucas for having ditched him. She has a surprise, tickets to a concert, where Stick Hippo is opening. Lucas wants to take Simone instead of Corey, much to his dismay. Jordan dumps Tyler for his unfaithfulness, and decides to go to prom alone. This prompts him to ask Simone to prom, which is the same night as the concert, and she agrees. Simone tells Lucas that she cannot attend the concert. Mei apologizes to Justin for her behavior and tells him the truth, but instead of feeling hurt that she is going to a different college, he tells her he is proud of her, and agree to attend prom together. As Lloyd gets rejected by another girl, he spots Lucas sitting outside the school, looking dejected. He learns of his situation, and tells Lucas his own problem. Two nights before the prom, Nova, Ali, and Mei are in Nova's room, chatting. Nova confesses to them that she has feelings for Jesse, which her father overhears. The next day, Nova's father tells Jesse he cannot ask Nova to prom, because he is \"bringing her down\". That afternoon, Jesse is unusually hostile towards Nova and deserts her. On prom night, Lucas climbs a tree to reach Simone's window. He tells her how he feels and begs her not to go to prom, but she goes anyway. Disappointed, Lucas realizes what a bad friend he has been to Corey, and offers him the other concert ticket. At her house, Nova is heartbroken, and refuses to pose for the camera in her prom dress.

Joseph Cinqu\u00e9, a leader of the Africans, leads a mutiny and takes over the ship. The mutineers spare the lives of two Spanish navigators to help them sail the ship back to Africa. Instead, the navigators misdirect the Africans and sail directly north to the east coast of the United States, where the ship is stopped by the American Navy, and the surviving Africans imprisoned as runaway slaves. In an unfamiliar country and not speaking a single word of English, the Africans find themselves in a legal battle. United States Attorney William S. Holabird brings charges of piracy and murder. Secretary of State John Forsyth, on behalf of President Martin Van Buren , represents the claim of the Spanish government that the African captives are property of Spain based on a treaty. Two Naval officers, Thomas R. Gedney and Richard W. Meade, claim them as salvage while the two Spanish navigators, Pedro Montez and Jose Ruiz, produce proof of purchase. A lawyer named Roger Sherman Baldwin, hired by the abolitionist Lewis Tappan and his black associate Theodore Joadson, decides to defend the Africans. Baldwin argues that the Africans had been kidnapped from the British colony of Sierra Leone to be sold in the Americas illegally. Baldwin proves through documents found hidden aboard La Amistad that the African captives were initially cargo belonging to a Portuguese slave ship, the Tecora. Therefore, the Africans were free citizens of Sierra Leone and not slaves at all. In light of this evidence, the staff of President Van Buren has the judge presiding over the case replaced by Judge Coglin, who is younger and believed to be impressionable and easily influenced. Consequently, seeking to make the case more personal, on the advice of former American president John Quincy Adams, Baldwin and Joadson find James Covey, a former slave who speaks both Mende and English. Cinqu\u00e9 tells his story at trial: Cinqu\u00e9 was kidnapped by slave traders outside his village, and held in the slave fortress of Lomboko, where thousands of captives were held under heavy guard. Cinqu\u00e9 and many others were then sold to the Tecora, where they were held in the brig of the ship. The captives were beaten and whipped, and at times, were given so little food that they had to eat the food from each other's faces. One day, fifty captives were thrown overboard. Later on, the ship arrived in Havana, Cuba. Those captives that were not sold at auction were handed over to La Amistad. United States Attorney Holabird attacks Cinqu\u00e9's \"tale\" of being captured and kept in the slave fortress, and especially questions the throwing of precious cargo overboard. Holabird contends that Cinqu\u00e9 could have been made a debt slave by his fellow Sierra Leoneans. However, the Royal Navy's fervent abolitionist Captain Fitzgerald of the West Africa Squadron backs up Cinqu\u00e9's account. Baldwin shows from the Tecora\u2019s inventory that the number of African people taken as slaves was reduced by fifty. Fitzgerald explains that some slave ships when interdicted do this to get rid of the evidence for their crime but in the Tecora\u2019s case, they had underestimated the amount of provisions necessary for their journey. As the tension rises, Cinqu\u00e9 stands up from his seat and repeatedly says, \"Give us, us free!\" Judge Coglin rules in favor of the Africans. After pressure from Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina on President Van Buren, the case is appealed to the Supreme Court. Despite refusing to help when the case was initially presented, Adams agrees to assist with the case. At the Supreme Court, he makes an impassioned and eloquent plea for their release, and is successful. The Lomboko slave fortress is liberated by the Royal Marines under the command of Captain Fitzgerald. After all the slaves are removed from the fortress, Fitzgerald orders the ship's cannon to destroy it. He then dictates a letter to Forsyth saying that he was correct \u2014 the slave fortress does not exist. Because of the release of the Africans, Van Buren loses his re-election campaign, and tension builds between the North and the South, which eventually culminates in the Civil War. Cinqu\u00e9 eventually returns to his homeland, but never reunites with his family.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Set to be directed by Anatole Litvak, this version would have been set in contemporary Paris, and would have portrayed the Phantom as a psychologically wounded World War I veteran who was physically unharmed, but imagined that he was disfigured. However, development lingered as the studio faced financial problems that resulted in the ousting of the original film's producer Carl Laemmle and his son, Carl Laemmle Jr. Plans for the remake finally surfaced again in November 1941, when Henry Koster became attached to direct. Koster discarded the previous screenplay, and envisioned a new version of the story in which the Phantom was Christine's father. Under Koster, the initial casting included Boris Karloff as The Phantom, Allan Jones as Raoul, and Deanna Durbin as Christine. Eddy was cast after leaving MGM for a two-picture deal with Universal. This led to Durbin refusing the role, not wanting to be compared to Eddy's frequent film partner Jeanette MacDonald, who Durbin admired. Karloff also became unavailable, and Koster also considered Cesar Romero, Feodor Chaliapin, Charles Laughton and Broderick Crawford for the Phantom. However, producer George Waggner eventually fired Koster from the project. After Koster's firing, Arthur Lubin was brought on to direct. Under Lubin, Koster's subplot about the Phantom being Christine's father was jettisoned, because it gave the romantic elements of their relationship incestuous overtones; however, the Phantom's obsession with Christine is not completely stated within the film. Lubin cast Rains in the film almost immediately, saying he was his \"only choice\" for the role. Foster, who had just left Paramount Pictures, was cast after meeting Lubin through a mutual friend, and auditioning for Waggner. Filming began on January 21, 1943. Lux Radio Theater presented a radio adaption of the film on September 13, 1943.

For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor. A pilot episode for a potential spinoff series, K-9 and Company, was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series. Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced. Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood , set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007.

A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series.

{"id": "164_291", "question": "Who was the producer of The Trap?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_35545", "text": "\"The Man Trap\" appeared in Gene Roddenberry's original pitch for Star Trek as the title of a show with a different plot: the crew face several apparitions that are \"wish-fulfilment traps which become as real as flesh and blood\"; the traps increase in subtlety until the crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality. Lee Erwin, who had previously worked on The Lieutenant with Roddenberry, was commissioned to produce a treatment; an outline featuring a salt-devouring vampire was handed in on April 8, 1966. Meanwhile, George Clayton Johnson had been assigned a storyline, tentatively titled \"Chicago II\", in which the crew of the Enterprise visit a planet where the culture was that of 1920s mob-era Chicago, which later evolved into \"A Piece of the Action\". Johnson was hired after story editor John D. F. Black recommended him to the producers. Johnson decided to use the 1953 science fiction novel The Syndic by Cyril M. Kornbluth as the basis for the story. Roddenberry felt that Johnson's treatment did not match his vision for Star Trek, but did not want to lose him entirely, and asked him to write \"The Man Trap\". Erwin was paid in full for his version, and given a separate \"kill fee\" because it would not be used. Roddenberry wanted to see more action, so the creature's ability to create apparitions was added to the script from the original pitch. Stan Robertson at NBC suggested to Roddenberry that they might wish to get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research, who said that, while it had never happened in reality, a quick death would be likely. Johnson suggested that the creature in \"The Man Trap\" could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of American bison. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing. Erwin was paid a further fee to terminate his contract, and Johnson wrote a first draft teleplay titled \"Damsel With a Dulcimer.\" While writing, Johnson consulted Black, who advised him to place the creature on the Enterprise quickly to increase the pace of the episode. This draft was delivered on May 23, but NBC felt that hallucinations were being overused; the same plot device had appeared in the pilot episode \"The Cage\". Johnson wrote a further draft on May 31, which reduced the number of apparitions, and was well received by Robert H. Justman. Roddenberry and Justman made further tweaks; one was to restore the name \"The Man Trap\" from Erwin's original treatment, another removed a scene which introduced McCoy's apprehension when using the transporter. Johnson further edited the script, but complained about the change in name. After a second edit by Johnson, it was passed from Justman to story editor Black. While the former felt that the script still needed work, Black felt it was nearly ready. Following Black's review, Roddenberry re-wrote the script between June 16 and 21. Johnson felt this re-write had \"downgrad[ed] the story.\" Black later said that Roddenberry removed a large part of Johnson's work, and that Johnson's original work was better than Roddenberry's edited version. Johnson was pleased with the final episode, although he was concerned that viewers might not understand Star Trek after watching \"The Man Trap\" owing to differences in characterization between this episode and the rest of the series. He admitted that he did not like Spock and was concerned that the character would not be understood after this episode. Roddenberry was pleased with Johnson's work, and offered him further writing work on \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\", which had been written by Robert Bloch. Roddenberry only wanted Johnson to \"polish\" the script; Johnson, feeling he was unable to improve it without starting from scratch, turned down the offer, but expressed the desire to work on the show again. He later wrote a story outline titled \"Rock-A-Bye Baby, or Die!\" in which the Enterprise would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes Kirk as its father. This was not commissioned, so \"The Man Trap\" was Johnson's only work on the franchise.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Vasu then scolds his henchmen for kidnapping the wrong woman and apologizes to both of them. As her birthday gift, Shanvi asks Daya to rescue the girl who was the actual target. Obliging the same, Daya fights off Vasu's goons and saves the girl, Lakshmi. Somehow, he later reconciles with Vasu and learns that Lakshmi has a piece of evidence against Vasu's brothers' atrocities. Daya meets her and learns that her sister Deepthi was kidnapped, raped, and brutally assaulted to death for 40 days by Vasu's four brothers, who filmed and stored the footage on a CD, which is with Lakshmi now. Taking the CD, Daya calls Vasu to arrange for tickets to send both Lakshmi and her mother to the United States, in exchange for the disc. Before leaving, Lakshmi's conversation with him brings a change in his mindset. Realizing he was indirectly responsible for the rape as he let the brothers escape, Daya has a change of heart when Murthy notifies him of the same, and he fights off Vasu's goons sent to retrieve the CD. Daya credits Shanvi for bringing the change in him and reveals the truth to her, after which she forgives him. After Deepthi's dead body is found and an autopsy is performed by a female doctor, Daya produces the CD as the evidence, which turns out to be an empty one. Though no further evidence exists, Daya asks for a gap of one day to provide necessary evidence so that Vasu's brothers do not escape as exonerated. Realizing he was betrayed by his lawyer, he regrets not making multiple copies of the CD in a conversation with Shanvi. Later, a drunk Daya is attacked by Vasu's men, but he manages to defeat all of them in the fight that ensues. The next day, Daya adds that he is also one among the 'five' men who sexually assaulted Deepthi and convinces the judge to put the five of them to death so that the other four do not escape death. This statement shocks the media and everyone, including Shanvi, who questions Daya as to why he did it. Realizing this, Lakshmi reveals to Murthy that she has an extra copy, which is then aired by the media, revealing only the four brothers to be guilty. Daya's death sentence is cancelled, while the remaining four initiate a brawl with the police, resulting in a fight that leaves three of them dead at the hands of Daya and the remaining one committing suicide in a last-minute attempt to escape him.

At the start of each Friends episode filming, the cast would ordinarily be introduced to the studio audience one at a time, but this time the cast headed out for their pre-curtain bow together. \"That made me cry,\" said Diane Newman, who was the script supervisor of the show. Among the specially invited audience of the taping were Hank Azaria, who played Phoebe's scientist boyfriend David in several episodes over the years; David Arquette, who filmed his then-wife Cox and the others backstage with a video camera; and Wheeler. Missing was Brad Pitt, Aniston's then-husband; Pitt told the producers he wanted to be surprised when the finale aired on television. Although some guests were invited, around 75% of the studio audience were 'ordinary' members of the public so that their reactions would be congruous with the rest of the series. However, friends, family and colleagues of the cast and crew served as extras throughout the episode.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_301", "question": "Who was the producer of The Women?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_24426", "text": "The musical Chicago is based on a play of the same name by reporter and playwright Maurine Dallas Watkins, who was assigned to cover the 1924 trials of accused murderers Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner for the Chicago Tribune.  In the early 1920s, Chicago's press and public became riveted by the subject of homicides committed by women. Several high-profile cases arose, which generally involved women killing their lovers or husbands. These cases were tried against a backdrop of changing views of women in the jazz age, and a long string of acquittals by Cook County juries of female murderers . A lore arose that, in Chicago, feminine or attractive women could not be convicted. The Chicago Tribune generally favored the prosecution's case, while still presenting the details of these women's lives. Its rivals at the Hearst papers were more pro-defendant, and employed what were derisively called \"sob-sisters\" \u2013 women reporters who focused on the plight, attractiveness, redemption, or grace of the female defendants. Regardless of stance, the press covered several of these women as celebrities. Annan, the model for the character of Roxie Hart, was 23 when she was accused of the April 3, 1924, murder of Harry Kalstedt, who served as the basis for the Fred Casely character.  The Tribune reported that Annan played the foxtrot record Hula Lou over and over for two hours before calling her husband to say she killed a man who \"tried to make love to her\".   Her husband Albert Annan inspired the character, Amos Hart. Albert was an auto mechanic who bankrupted himself to defend his wife, only for her to publicly dump him the day after she was acquitted. Velma Kelly is based on Gaertner, who was a cabaret singer, and society divorc\u00e9e. The body of Walter Law was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of Gaertner's abandoned car on March 12, 1924. Two police officers testified that they had seen a woman getting into the car and shortly thereafter heard gunshots. A bottle of gin and an automatic pistol were found on the floor of the car. Lawyers William Scott Stewart and W. W. O'Brien were models for a composite character in Chicago, Billy Flynn. Just days apart, separate juries acquitted both women. Watkins' sensational columns documenting these trials proved so popular that she wrote a play based on them. The show received both good box-office sales and newspaper notices and was mounted on Broadway in 1926, running 172 performances. Cecil B. DeMille produced a silent film version, Chicago , starring former Mack Sennett bathing beauty Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart. It was later remade as Roxie Hart starring Ginger Rogers, but in this version, Roxie was accused of murder without having really committed it. In the 1960s, Gwen Verdon read the play and asked her husband, Bob Fosse, about the possibility of creating a musical adaptation. Fosse approached playwright Watkins numerous times to buy the rights, but she repeatedly declined; by this point she may have regretted that Annan and Gaertner had been allowed to walk free, and that her treatment of them should not be glamorized. Nonetheless, upon her death in 1969, her estate sold the rights to producer Richard Fryer, Verdon, and Fosse. John Kander and Fred Ebb began work on the musical score, modeling each number on a traditional vaudeville number or a vaudeville performer. This format made explicit the show's comparison between \"justice\", \"show-business\", and contemporary society. Ebb and Fosse penned the book of the musical, and Fosse also directed and choreographed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Andrew O'Hehir with Salon wrote: \"Swank gives a magnificent performance as a woman whose calm and capable exterior cannot completely conceal her worsening desperation. In its unsentimental poetry, its stripped-down imagery and its unforgettable lead performances, 'The Homesman' is a ruthless western classic ... cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto\u2019s harsh, horizontal landscapes\u2014like the haunting, unsettling score by Marco Beltrami\u2014are anything but picturesque and reassuring, and serve to support a strikingly bleak portrait of life on the 19th-century American frontier\". Claudia Puig with USA Today wrote: \"Set on the Great Plains in the mid-1800s, 'The Homesman' aims for a story that's poignant and told sparely, but comes across as mawkish, tedious and self-indulgent. Swank brings a gravitas to her character that is undermined when some of her antics are played for laughs.

Buck elected to leave the booth after one season, though, and was replaced by another famed announcer in Dan Kelly. This setup\u2014Kelly as commentator, with either Kyle, Bob Plager, or Noel Picard joining as an analyst, simulcast on KMOX and KPLR\u2014continued through the 1975\u201376 season, then simulcast on KMOX and KDNL-TV for the next three seasons. KMOX is a 50,000-watt clear-channel station that reaches almost all of North America at night, allowing Kelly to become a celebrity in both the United States and Canada. Indeed, many of the Blues' players liked the fact that their families could hear the games on KMOX. From 1979 to 1981, the radio and television broadcasts were separated for the first time since the inaugural season, with Kelly doing the radio broadcasts and Eli Gold hired to do the television. Following the 1980\u201381 season, the television broadcasts moved from KDNL to NBC affiliate KSD-TV for the 1981\u201382 season, produced by Sports Network Incorporated , owned and operated by Greg Maracek who did the broadcasts with Channel 5 sportscaster Ron Jacober. The broadcasts failed to produce a profit and then returned to KPLR for the 1982 NHL playoffs and the 1982\u201383 season before returning to KDNL for the 1983\u201384 season, the first under the ownership of Harry Ornest. The Blues skated back to KPLR 3 years later. In 1985, Ornest, wanting more broadcast revenue, put the radio rights up for bid. A new company who had purchased KXOK won the bid for a three-year contract and Kelly moved over from KMOX to do the games on KXOK. However, the station was never financially competitive in the market. Additionally, fans complained they could not hear the station at night . KXOK backed out of the contract after just 2 years, and the Blues immediately went back to KMOX, who held the rights until 2000. Dan Kelly continued to broadcast the games on radio but was diagnosed in the summer of 1988 with lung cancer and died on February 10, 1989. After his death, Ron Jacober was hired as the radio play-by-play announcer for the remainder of the season, and John Kelly succeeded in that position. After Dan Kelly's death, Ken Wilson became St. Louis Blues' lead television play-by-play announcer alongside former Blues' players Joe Micheletti and Bruce Affleck. During this time, from 1989 to 2000, more games began to be aired on Prime Sports Midwest, the forerunner to today's Bally Sports Midwest. The long-term partnership between KMOX and the Blues had its problems, however, namely during spring when the ever-popular St. Louis Cardinals began their season. Blues games, many of which were crucial to playoff berths, would often be pre-empted for spring training coverage. Angry at having to play \"second fiddle\", the Blues elected to leave for KTRS in 2000. However, in an ironic twist the Cards purchased a controlling interest in KTRS in 2005, and once again preferred to air preseason baseball over regular-season hockey. In response, the Blues moved back to KMOX starting in the 2006\u201307 season. The season of 2008\u201309 saw the Blues play their last game on KPLR, which had the rights since the 1986\u201387 season , electing to move all their games to FS Midwest, starting with the 2009\u201310 season. The Cardinals moved back to KMOX in the 2011 season, with conflicting games moved to KYKY, an FM station owned by the same group as KMOX. Since the 2019\u201320 preseason, WXOS has been the flagship radio station for the Blues. Chris Kerber and Joe Vitale are the current radio broadcast team. John Kelly and Darren Pang are the current team for television coverage, while Scott Warmann, Erica Weston, Bernie Federko, and Jamie Rivers present the pre-game and post-game shows.

Artificial Intelligence is a 2001 American science fiction drama film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson were based on the 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" by Brian Aldiss. The film was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg and Bonnie Curtis. It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt. Set in a futuristic post-climate change society, A.I. tells the story of David , a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love. Development of A.I. originally began with producer-director Stanley Kubrick, after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay. A.I. Artificial Intelligence was released in North America on June 29, 2001, by Warner Bros. Pictures and internationally by DreamWorks Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed approximately $235 million against a budget of $90\u2013100 million.

Their collaborations created a blue-eyed soul album with folk rock, indie pop, and jazz influences and lyrics describing heartbreak, nostalgia and relationships. Upon release, 19 received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Adele's vocal prowess and songwriting talent at such a young age and noted her as having the \"potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" 19 also won numerous accolades including the Mercury Prize and the European Border Breakers Award.

Rinehart purchased the rights back from Selig in 1920 to avoid conflicts over potential film adaptations of The Bat. But in 1921, Selig re-released his film as The Bat to capitalize on the play's success. Wagenhals and Kemper filed suit to block Selig's use of the title. Three films were based on the original Broadway play. The first, a silent film also called The Bat, was produced and directed by Roland West, who co-wrote the screenplay with Julien Josephson and George Marion Jr. Cornelia was played by Emily Fitzroy, and Eddie Gribbon was the Bat. West's wife, Jewel Carmen, played Dale Ogden as her last film role. West made the actors work at night to get them in the mood for the thriller. The film was released by United Artists on March 14, 1926. The year before, West had directed an adaptation of one of The Bat imitators, The Monster. Critics considered The Bat to be an improvement over that previous film; it received positive reviews and did well at the box office. The film was considered lost for decades, but a print was discovered in the 1980s. Following the commercialization of sound films, West remade the story four years later as The Bat Whispers. The remake, released by United Artists on November 29, 1930, starred Chester Morris as the Bat and Una Merkel as Dale; British actress Grayce Hampton played Cornelia. West experimented with early widescreen technology by having two cinematographers film different versions of the movie, one with a standard 35 mm camera, the other with a new 65 mm \"Magnifilm\" camera. Like the earlier silent film adaptation, The Bat Whispers was considered lost until the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored both the standard and widescreen versions from rediscovered negatives in 1988. The film received mixed reviews and the experiment with widescreen was a financial failure. Comic-book creator Bob Kane said in his 1989 autobiography, Batman and Me, that the villain in The Bat Whispers inspired his character Batman. Crane Wilbur wrote and directed a third adaptation of The Bat, which was released by Allied Artists on August 9, 1959. This version emphasized horror, with the Bat ripping out the throats of his victims. Dr. Wells had a more prominent role, and Agnes Moorehead co-starred as Cornelia.

Rihanna told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that she enjoyed working with Timberlake, and learned much from the sessions. She said, \"Working with Justin in the studio is just great.

As such when promoting the film he noted that it's \"80 percent factual information.\" According to script writer Michael Wallach, the script originally started out as a short story about a young couple who comes across a dead town.

In April 2001, he entered negotiations with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow to direct the then-untitled film with actor Brad Pitt in the lead role. Requiem for a Dream was screened for Pitt, and the preliminary script for The Fountain persuaded the actor to join the project. Aronofsky prepared for production by traveling with a crew to Central America to consult with Mayan experts and to explore the Mexican ruins of Palenque. The group also visited Tikal, a jungle location featured in the 1977 film Star Wars. In addition to the trip, the films Aguirre, the Wrath of God and The Holy Mountain were screened for the crew to inspire it in designing a rainforest set for The Fountain. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join Aronofsky's project. Aronofsky, who wanted the film's actual title to be a secret, gave the project the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed to improve the script and to wait for Blanchett, pregnant when she joined, to give birth to her child in December 2001. The start date for production was tentatively set in summer 2002. In June 2002, Warner Bros. met with Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson, expressing concerns over an escalating budget and threatening to cease the project unless a co-financier was found. Watson petitioned independent production companies for support and was able to enlist Regency Enterprises for assistance. Production was ultimately set for late October 2002 in Queensland and Sydney, Australia. The film, officially titled The Fountain, was 'greenlit' with a budget of $70 million, co-financed by Warner Bros. and New Regency, who filled the gap after Village Roadshow withdrew from the project. Preparation for production of The Fountain cost $18 million. Abruptly, Pitt, whose requested screenplay revisions were not met, left the project seven weeks before the first day of shooting. The actor went on to star as Achilles in director Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. With the studio threatening to shut down the project, Aronofsky sent the script to actor Russell Crowe as a potential replacement for Pitt. However, Crowe, worn out from recently completing Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, declined. In September 2002, Jeff Robinov, President of Production at Warner Bros. Pictures, announced that The Fountain would cease production, with Blanchett receiving compensation for her time and the Australian crew being fired from the halted project. Sets built for the production of the film, including a 10-story Mayan temple, were eventually auctioned off, in addition to props and other items. Pitt said that he was disappointed to leave and added, \"I remain encouraged that The Fountain will yet have its day.\" Aronofsky began to develop other films. When he looked over the books he used to research for The Fountain, he decided to return to The Fountain, feeling closer to it creatively than the other possible projects. Without a studio and an actor, he decided to write a \"no-budget\" version of the film, using his experiences filming Pi and Requiem for a Dream with small budgets. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected Aronofsky's project and began to court actor Hugh Jackman to replace Pitt in the lead role. The film received a second greenlight with a budget of $35 million, in part because of the director's willingness to leave costly set pieces out of the screenplay.

It is based on agricultural production, mainly in grain agribusiness, with emphasis on rice, soybeans and corn. It is said that the state works in the so-called \u201cpaycheck economy\u201d, when there is a circulation mainly of the amounts paid in salaries to public servants and private employees of commerce. In livestock, the live cattle trade for slaughter in Manaus was, until the 1970s, the main economic base. For years, between 6 and 10 thousand oxen were traded with Manaus annually. This type of trade brought foodstuffs, clothing, household items, among others, to Roraima. This form of supply ended due to two main factors: population growth in the state, through the inauguration of the Manaus\u2013Boa Vista Road, and the decrease in the cattle herd. Rice took the place of meat, starting to be traded with Manaus in the late 1970s. In 1977, agricultural mechanization for rice crop was introduced, increasing production capacity. In the beginning, mechanization was applied in the area of plowing for the production of upland rice, which did not have the success expected by several factors. One of them was the lack of physical structure for storing production, as there were no dryers and warehouses. However, this system made it possible to shift production to irrigated rice. With more capitalized producers and government support in the construction of warehouses and dryers, production became viable. This type of rice came to be produced in the floodplains of the Branco, Takutu, Uraricoera and Cauam\u00e9 rivers, with productivity high enough to cover the high costs of implanting and maintaining this crop in Roraima. Subsequently, the cultivation of soybeans appeared in the plowing, with the planted area being increased year by year. The biggest problems of this crop are in the area of guaranteeing land tenure, its incompatibilities with environmental laws, in addition to irregularity and poor reliability of transport. These two largest crops in Roraima decreased with the conquest by the peoples from the Demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Area. Other crops such as corn, cassava and beans are also present. But they do not reach the level of rice and soy production. In the case of manioc for the production of flour, Roraima is self-sufficient. In the area of fruit growing, pineapple, orange, banana, papaya, melon, watermelon, grape, lemon, passion fruit and tangerine are produced in the state. The melon, watermelon and papaya stand out for their quality recognition. There has been great progress with vegetables in recent years. The production of lettuce, green onions, parsley, peppers, sweet potatoes, string beans, pumpkin, cabbage and sweet pepper have increased, and it can be said that there is also self-sufficiency in this sector. Greenhouse production has helped in this process. Roraima has always occupied a secondary position in the economic geography of the Amazon when it comes to plant extractivism, producing Brazil nuts, rowanberries and wood. The first two in the southern region of the state, especially under the Branco River. They are sold in Manaus, but on a small scale. The wood has been explored and traded with Venezuela and, more recently, with other countries in Europe and Asia. The Roraiman industry is small. In the Industrial District of Boa Vista, located on the edge of the BR-174, there were 58 plants in operation in 2015. They produce cereals, wood, leather, and others. The commercial sector is traditional, buying from other places, such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Manaus, and reselling in Boa Vista and other municipalities. Getting closer commercially with neighboring countries to practice foreign trade is a path that has been recently traced. The main trading partner for exports and imports is Venezuela; the main product exported in 2004 and 2010 was wood; in 2015, there was a good diversification with the export of soy, leather and mineral water, in addition to wood. The products imported in greater quantity have been machines, devices and mechanical instruments. The municipalities that export the most are Boa Vista, Bonfim, Caracara\u00ed, Mucaja\u00ed and Rorain\u00f3polis.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Agriculture represents 5.4% of GDP . Cear\u00e1 exports: leather footwear   20.3%, crustaceans 17.6%, woven of cotton 16.9%, cashew 14.7%, leather 13.1%, fruits, juices and honey 5.4% .  It is one of only three Brazilian states which together produce the world's entire supply of carnauba wax. Share of the Brazilian economy: 2,04% . According to the data from IPECE and IBGE, the GDP growth of the State of Cear\u00e1 in 2014 was of 4.36%, while Brazil's overall GDP grew only 0.1% in the same year. Traditionally an agriculture-based state, Cear\u00e1 began an industrialisation program under the military regime , and the industrial sector continues to expand annually. In 1999, industry accounted for 39.3% of the state's GDP. Tourism also plays a large role in Cear\u00e1's economy, with the state's many waterfalls, beaches and rainforests. On average, Fortaleza alone receives half a million tourists annually. In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of cashew nuts, coconut, papaya, melon and beans. The production of cashew in Brazil is carried out almost exclusively in the Northeast. The area occupied by cashew trees in Brazil in 2017 was estimated at 505,500 ha; of this total, 99.5% is located in the Northeast. The main producers in this region are Cear\u00e1 , Rio Grande do Norte and Piau\u00ed. However, Brazil, which in 2011 was the fifth largest world producer of cashew nuts, in 2016, fell to 14th position, with 1.5% of the total volume of nuts produced in the world. Vietnam, Nigeria, India and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were the world's largest cashew nut producers in 2016, with 70.6% of global production. In recent years, there has been increased competition with some African countries, where government programs have driven the expansion of culture and processing capacity. It is estimated that at 295 thousand tons per year the installed capacity for processing cashew nuts in the Northeast, however, the Region only managed to produce around a quarter of that quantity. Among the main world producers, Brazil has the lowest productivity. Several factors are pointed out as the cause of the low productivity and the fall in the Brazilian production of cashew nuts. One reason is that most orchards are in a phase of natural decline in production. In addition, the giant cashew trees, which are the majority in the Region, are exploited in an almost extractive manner, with low use of technology. In 2017, the Northeast Region was the largest producer of coconut in the country, with 74.0% of national production. Bahia produced 351 million fruits, Sergipe, 234 million, and Cear\u00e1 187 million. However, the sector has been suffering strong competition and losing market to Indonesia, the Philippines and India, the world's largest producers, who even export coconut water to Brazil. In addition to climatic problems, the low productivity of coconut palms in the Northeast Region is the result of factors related to the variety of coconut harvested and the technological level used in coastal regions. In these areas, the semi-extractive cultivation system still prevails, with low fertility and without the adoption of cultural management practices. The three states that have the largest production, Bahia, Sergipe and Cear\u00e1, present a yield three times lower than that of Pernambuco, which is in 5th place in the national production. This is because most of the coconut trees in these three states are located in coastal areas and cultivated in semi-extractivist systems. In 2018, the South Region was the main producer of beans with 26.4% of the total, followed by the Midwest , Southeast Region , Northeast and North . The largest producers in the Northeast were Cear\u00e1 and Bahia. In cassava production, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. Maranh\u00e3o was the 7th largest producer in the country, with 681 thousand tons. Cear\u00e1 was 9th, with 622 thousand tons. In total, the northeast produced 3,5 million tons. Rio Grande do Norte is the largest producer of melon in the country. In 2017 it produced 354 thousand tons. The Northeast region accounted for 95.8% of the country's production in 2007. In addition to Rio Grande do Norte, which in 2005 produced 45.4% of the country's total, the other 3 largest in the country were Cear\u00e1, Bahia and Pernambuco. In the production of papaya, in 2018 Bahia was the 2nd largest producer state in Brazil, almost equaling with Esp\u00edrito Santo. Cear\u00e1 was in 3rd place and Rio Grande do Norte in 4th place. In the production of banana, in 2018 Cear\u00e1 was the 8th largest national producer, with 408 thousand tons. The state stands out nationally in raising goats and sheep. In 2016, Cear\u00e1 had the fourth largest herd of goats in the country, with 1.13 million heads. The state occupied the same position in the herd of sheep, with 2.31 million animals. Cear\u00e1's cattle herd is small compared to other states in Brazil. In 2019, it had 2.4 million heads. Milk production was 705 million liters this year. In 2017, the Northeast was the largest shrimp producer in the country. National production was 41 thousand tons. Rio Grande do Norte and Cear\u00e1 were the largest producers. Aracati, in Ceara, was the municipality with the highest participation. About industry, Cear\u00e1 had in 2017 an industrial GDP of R$ 22.2 billion, equivalent to 1.9% of the national industry. It employs 296,734 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Construction , Industrial Public Utility Services, such as Electricity and Water , Food , Leather and footwear and Clothing . These 5 sectors concentrate 75.7% of the state's industry. The main sectors of the Cear\u00e1 industry are clothing, food, metallurgy, textiles, chemicals and footwear. Most of the industries are installed in the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza, where the Industrial District of Maracana\u00fa is located. In S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Amarante, a steel mill is installed, Companhia Sider\u00fargica do Pec\u00e9m, which in 2018 produced 2.9 million tons of crude steel, of the 35.4 million produced in the country.

Although a solo album, it features many appearances by then-emerging American rapper Snoop Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for his own solo career. The Chronic peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has been certified 3x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with sales of 3 million copies in the United States, which led to Dr. Dre becoming one of the top ten best-selling American performing artists of 1993. The Chronic spent eight months in the Billboard Top 10.

Four years after the film's release, Judge recalled that one of his assistant directors on the film told him they had gone out to eat at a TGI Fridays and noticed that the waitstaff were no longer wearing buttons on their uniforms, the \"flair\" Joanna quits her job over in the film. Asked why, the manager told him that after Office Space had come out, customers started making jokes about it, so the chain dropped the requirement from its dress code. \"So, maybe I made the world a better place\" he told Deadline Hollywood in 2014. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly ranked it fifth on its list \"25 Great Comedies From the Past 25 Years\", despite having originally given the film a poor review. In February 2009, a reunion of many of the cast members took place at the Paramount Theatre in Austin to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the film. Rothman said in 2019 that despite his connection to several films that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, he hopes Office Space will be mentioned before them in his obituary. \"[Office Space] spoke to a generation in a way that few movies have,\" said John Altschuler, who produced Extract, Judge's later companion piece. \"Nobody does this kind of material. It's all about the weirdness of real people in real life.\" In a 2017 profile of Judge, New York Times Magazine writer Willy Staley observed that the film has been compared to Herman Melville's short story \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\", in which a lawyer's clerk, like Peter, shows up at the office one day but declines all work, telling his boss \"I would prefer not to\". Staley's own high school English teacher, he recalled, brought up Office Space in class to get students to appreciate how tedious Franz Kafka's work at an insurance company was. \"It's such a brutal portrayal of workplace misery that its most useful points of comparison date back to when office culture was first unleashed on humanity.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Arsenal's results in the Apertura and Clausura of the 2006\u201307 season, qualified them for two major international tournaments, the secondary 2007 Copa Sudamericana and the top 2008 Copa Libertadores, the first time in their history that Arsenal qualified for South America's premier club tournament. Arsenal's run through the 2007 Copa Sudamericana would lead Sports Illustrated to declare them \"the underdog that couldn't be stopped\". They beat reigning Argentine champions San Lorenzo in the qualifying round to earn a place in the Round of 16 where it faced Brazilian team Goi\u00e1s. Arsenal won 3\u20132 in Brazil and recorded a 1\u20131 draw in the second leg to win the tie 4\u20133 on aggregate, achieving its first official victory over foreign opposition. Arsenal then met Mexican side Guadalajara in the quarter-finals, with a 0\u20130 draw at home, and a 3\u20131 victory at Estadio Jalisco. Advancing to the semi-finals, Arsenal met the other Argentine team still in the running, River Plate. Both games against River ended 0\u20130, Arsenal progressing to the final after winning the penalty shootout 4\u20132, with a number of saves from Mario Cuenca, Arsenal's goalkeeper. In the first leg of the 2007 Copa Sudamericana final, Arsenal beat Club Am\u00e9rica of Mexico 3\u20132 at Estadio Azteca. Their upcoming home field advantage was mitigated by the fact that the second match could not be held in the Estadio Julio H. Grondona, because its capacity of 16,300 did not meet the CONMEBOL criteria of 40,000 for major finals. The game was finally held at the Estadio Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n in Avellaneda. Arsenal entered the match without captain Carlos Castiglione, who was suspended due to a red card in the first leg. With these mitigating factors, Arsenal needed to avoid letting Club Am\u00e9rica win by a two-goal margin. The match started badly for the Argentine team when Christian D\u00edaz scored an own goal inside the first 20 minutes. Jos\u00e9 Luis Calder\u00f3n then hit the woodwork twice for Arsenal. In the 2nd half Arsenal conceded a second goal, but with only 7 minutes remaining Mart\u00edn Andrizzi scored, giving Arsenal their first major title on the away goals rule. Arsenal was not as successful in the 2008 Copa Libertadores, which started the month after their 2007 Copa Sudamericana. However, on 30 July 2008, Arsenal won its second international cup, the Suruga Bank Championship, which they qualified for as Copa Sudamericana champion.

He discovered Eric Liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon a reference book on the Olympics while housebound from the flu in a rented house in Los Angeles. Screenwriter Colin Welland, commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his Academy Award-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died on 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams' February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film. Aubrey Montague's son saw Welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home \u2013 which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from \"Darling Mummy\" to \"Dear Mum\" and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague's letters are from the originals. Welland's original script also featured, in addition to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay. Initial financing towards development costs was provided by Goldcrest Films, who then sold the project to Allied, but kept a percentage of the profits. Ian Charleson wrote Eric Liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead. Puttnam chose Hugh Hudson, a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct Chariots of Fire. Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies.

Eisner declined but recommended Harlan Ellison, who wrote a two-hour live-action script for the filmmaker. Friedkin and Ellison afterward had an unrelated argument, and the project was abandoned. During the 1980s, Brad Bird, Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz attempted to get an animated adaptation off the ground, though studio executives praised the screenplay, they thought the film would be unmarketable, and this version was scrapped. In the early 1990s, producer Michael Uslan and executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Steven Maier subsequently obtained the rights for a live-action film adaptation. The producer promised Eisner that he would not permit anyone who \"didn't get it\" to work on the project. Two ideas pitched to Uslan were to put the Spirit in a costume and to have the Spirit be a resurrected dead man who possessed supernatural powers. Screenwriter John Turman, a comic book fan, expressed interest in writing the script. In July 2004, financier OddLot Entertainment acquired the rights to the film. OddLot's producers Gigi Pritzker and Deborah Del Prete began a collaboration with Uslan, Melniker, and Maier working at Batfilm Productions, to adapt the story. Eisner, who was protective of the rights to his creations, said that he believed in the producers to faithfully adapt The Spirit. In April 2005, comic-book writer Jeph Loeb was hired to adapt The Spirit for the big screen, but the writer eventually left the project. Later in April, Uslan approached Frank Miller at Will Eisner's memorial service in New York City several weeks after Miller's Sin City was released in theaters, interested in initiating the adaptation technique with Miller's film for The Spirit.  Miller had initially hesitated, doubting his skill in adapting The Spirit, but ultimately embraced his first solo project as writer-director. Miller described his decision-making: In July 2006, the film trade press reported Miller would write and direct the film adaptation for The Spirit\u2009; Miller and the producers publicly announced this at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Miller said that he was putting together a film treatment that included large parts of The Spirit strip panels. As Miller described the project, \"I intend to be extremely faithful to the heart and soul of the material, but it won't be nostalgic. It will be much scarier than people expect\". Miller filmed The Spirit using the same digital background technology that was used for Sin City and 300. The film would also copy specific shots from the comic, similar to Sin City. In February 2007, Miller completed the first draft of the screenplay and began work on a second draft.  Principal photography was initially slated to begin in late spring 2007.  Miller also planned to begin filming Sin City 2 in spring 2009, and Uslan indicated that filming for The Spirit would begin before Miller started Sin City 2.

Lee Ranaldo recalled Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore were keen on inviting Fleming and Mascis \"both as extended family and as people to have an opinion\"; both Ranaldo and Steve Shelley were uncomfortable about their presence \"because we'd never made records before where there were other people involved\". The original working title for the album was Blowjob?, mostly to test the humor of their new label, but ultimately the band was convinced to drop the name in favor of Goo, a title inspired by one of the album's tracks, \"My Friend Goo\". Because the results of these sessions were later heavily bootlegged, Moore officially released them on the album Goo Demos in 1991. At engineer Nick Sansano's recommendation, with a sizable budget finally at their disposal, Sonic Youth booked themselves into Sorcerer Sound in early 1990. Sansano knew well from his work on Daydream Nation that the band, particular Ranaldo, enjoyed overdubbing sound and guitar effects. At Sorcerer Sound, the studio was equipped with two 24-track consoles, allowing the group as many instrumentals as they desired. Sonic Youth used the studio time to experiment with abstract techniques such as hanging microphones from the Sorcerer Sound's catwalk and isolating Shelley in a drum booth. Early on, however, the band was bogged down by issues: \"It took us forever to get final takes\", said Ranaldo, \"Something would inevitably go wrong for somebody and we'd have to start again. I remember getting fairly frustrated with it\". After the basic tracks were completed, Sonic Youth moved to Greene St. Recording, Sansano's home base, to finalize the songs and begin the process of mixing Goo. Additional layers of guitar lines were included; vocals were manipulated with different distortion devices, particularly on \"Mary-Christ\". Also in the studio again were Mascis and Fleming to serve as consultants, Mascis for the album's vocal parts and Fleming for the percussion sounds. Fleming felt Gordon's vocals, with her unconventional timbre, were a particular pleasure to record, noting her eagerness to attempt different approaches with her delivery during the sessions. Sansano, however, was unsure of the album's direction: Each member of Sonic Youth brought their own philosophy to arranging the music that conflicted with the label owner's expectations for a radio-friendly album. Although Gary Gersh, one of Geffen's managers, denies that Geffen placed any pressures on Sonic Youth to produce a commercial album, upon listening to the first mixes from the sessions, both Gersh and the band were concerned about Sansano's abilities to finish Goo and insisted on hiring a veteran producer\u2014the group chose jazz musician-turned-producer Ron Saint Germain\u2014to arrange the final mixes. Sansano voluntarily left the project but was so dejected by the group's lack of faith that he refused to speak to them years afterwards. With Germain, the band gave him relatively free rein to sort through the countless overdubs that Sonic Youth had worked on before his entry into the project. He already had an extensive resume, including his work in the jazz community and Bad Brains' highly-influential album I Against I. By the time Goo was complete, its costs rose to $150,000 , five times as much as Daydream Nation. The figure was staggering for a cost-conscious band; according to Shelley, Sonic Youth would have been better served releasing the original Goo demos to reduce the final costs.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_355", "question": "Who was the producer of Images?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_14039", "text": "A contentious question about Isis is whether her cult influenced Christianity. Some Isiac customs may have been among the pagan religious practices that were incorporated into Christian traditions as the Roman Empire was Christianized. Andreas Alf\u00f6ldi, for instance, argued in the 1930s that the medieval Carnival festival, in which a model boat was carried, developed from the Navigium Isidis. Much attention focuses on whether traits of Christianity were borrowed from pagan mystery cults, including that of Isis. The more devoted members of Isis's cult made a personal commitment to a deity they regarded as superior to others, as Christians did. Both Christianity and the Isis cult had an initiation rite: the mysteries for Isis, baptism in Christianity. One of the mystery cults' shared themes\u2014a god whose death and resurrection may be connected with the individual worshipper's well-being in the afterlife\u2014resembles the central theme of Christianity. The suggestion that Christianity's basic beliefs were taken from mystery cults has provoked heated debate for more than 200 years. In response to these controversies, both Hugh Bowden and Jaime Alvar, scholars who study ancient mystery cults, suggest that similarities between Christianity and the mystery cults were not produced by direct borrowing of ideas but by their common background: the Greco-Roman culture in which they all developed. Similarities between Isis and Mary, the mother of Jesus, have also been scrutinized. They have been subject to controversy between Protestant Christians and the Catholic Church, as many Protestants have argued that Catholic veneration of Mary is a remnant of paganism. The classicist R. E. Witt saw Isis as the \"great forerunner\" of Mary. He suggested that converts to Christianity who had formerly worshipped Isis would have seen Mary in much the same terms as their traditional goddess. He pointed out that the two had several spheres of influence in common, such as agriculture and the protection of sailors. He compared Mary's title \"Mother of God\" to Isis's epithet \"mother of the god\", and Mary's \"queen of heaven\" to Isis's \"queen of heaven\". Stephen Benko, a historian of early Christianity, argues that devotion to Mary was deeply influenced by the worship of several goddesses, not just Isis. In contrast, John McGuckin, a church historian, says that Mary absorbed superficial traits from these goddesses, such as iconography, but the fundamentals of her cult were thoroughly Christian. Images of Isis with Horus in her lap are often suggested as an influence on the iconography of Mary, particularly images of the Mary nursing the infant Jesus, as images of nursing women were rare in the ancient Mediterranean world outside Egypt. Vincent Tran Tam Tinh points out that the latest images of Isis nursing Horus date to the fourth century CE, while the earliest images of Mary nursing Jesus date to the seventh century CE. Sabrina Higgins, drawing on his study, argues that if there is a connection between the iconographies of Isis and Mary, it is limited to images from Egypt. In contrast, Thomas F. Mathews and Norman Muller think Isis's pose in late antique panel paintings influenced several types of Marian icons, inside and outside Egypt. Elizabeth Bolman says these early Egyptian images of Mary nursing Jesus were meant to emphasize his divinity, much as images of nursing goddesses did in ancient Egyptian iconography. Higgins argues that such similarities prove that images of Isis influenced those of Mary, but not that Christians deliberately adopted Isis's iconography or other elements of her cult.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Butler described him as a \"crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads\".  Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English.  The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used.  Each script contained local references, such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities.  Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions. The first European production opened in Stockholm, Sweden, on September 20, 1968, with a cast including Ulf Brunnberg and Bill \u00d6hrstr\u00f6m, produced and directed by Pierre Fr\u00e4nckel and choreographed by Julie Arenal, and ran for 134 performances until March 1969.

Redd was one of six African-Americans brought to Australia to provide a racially integrated tribe. The production broke local box-office records and ran for two years, but because of some of the language in the show, the cast album was banned in Queensland and New Zealand.

In Mexico the production was banned by the government after one night in Acapulco. An 18-year-old S\u00f4nia Braga appeared in the 1969 Brazilian production. Another notable production was in Belgrade, in the former Yugoslavia, in 1969. It was the first Hair to be produced in a communist country. The show, translated into Serbian, was directed by female producer-director Mira Trailovi\u0107 at the Atelje 212 theatre. It featured Dragan Nikoli\u0107, Branko Mili\u0107evi\u0107, Seka Sabli\u0107 and Du\u0161an Prelevi\u0107. Over four years, the production received 250 performances and was attended by president Tito. Local references in the script included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania, Yugoslavia's traditional rival. By 1970, Hair was a huge financial success, and nineteen productions had been staged outside of North America.  In addition to those named above, these included productions in Scandinavia, South America, Italy, Israel, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria.  According to Billboard, the various productions of the show were raking in almost $1\u00a0million every ten days, and royalties were being collected for 300 different recordings of the show's songs, making it \"the most successful score in history as well as the most performed score ever written for the Broadway stage.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pence listened to the expression of concern about President-elect Donald Trump's upcoming administration and later expressed that he was not offended. However, Trump demanded an apology for what he described on Twitter as the cast having \"harassed\" Pence. This led to an online campaign called \"#BoycottHamilton\", which became widely mocked as the show was already sold out months in advance. Trump was criticized by The Washington Post, who noted the division between white and non-white America in the 2016 Presidential election and suggested Trump could have offered \"assurances that he would be a president for all Americans\u2014that he would respect everybody regardless of race or gender or creed\"; instead, as presidential historian Robert Dallek expressed, Trump's Twitter response was a \"striking act of divisiveness by an incoming president struggling to heal the nation after a bitter election\", with the Hamilton cast a proxy for those fearful of Trump's policies and rhetoric.

Sales of the book were modest: Knopf produced three small print runs each under 2,000 copies. While early reviews were primarily positive, it received little attention beyond New York City. Comparing it to Larsen's previous novel Quicksand, Alice Dunbar-Nelson's review in The Washington Eagle began by declaring that \"Nella Larsen delights again with her new novel\". Writer and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois hailed it as the \"one of the finest novels of the year\" and believed that its limited success was due to its treating a \"forbidden subject,\" the marriage of a white man to a mixed-race girl who did not reveal her ancestry. A common criticism of the novel is that it ends too suddenly, without a full exploration of the issues it raises. Mary Rennels, writing in the New York Telegram, said, \"Larsen didn't solve the problem [of passing]. Knocking a character out of a scene doesn't settle a matter.\" An anonymous reviewer for the New York Times Book Review similarly concluded that \"the most serious fault with the book is its sudden and utterly unconvincing close\", but otherwise considered it an effective treatment of the topic. On the other hand, Dunbar-Nelson found that the ending confirmed to the reader that \"you have been reading a masterpiece all along.\" In modern scholarship, Larsen is recognized as one of the central figures in the African-American, feminist and modernist canons, a reputation that is based on her two novels and some short stories. As of 2007, Passing is the subject of more than 200 scholarly articles and more than 50 dissertations, which offer a range of critical interpretations. It has been hailed as a text helping to \"create a modernist psychological interiority\u00a0... challenging marriage and middle-class domesticity, complexly interrogating gender, race, and sexual identity, and for redeploying traditional tropes\u2014such as that of the tragic mulatta\u2014with a contemporary and critical twist.\" However, literary critic Cheryl Wall summarizes the critical response to Passing as less favorable than to Larsen's first novel Quicksand, citing the views of  Amaritjit Singh in The Novels of the Harlem Renaissance , of Robert Bone in The Negro Novel in America , and of Hoyt Fuller in his \"Introduction\" to Passing .\"  On one hand, the significance of sexual jealousy in the story has been seen to detract from the topic of racial passing; conversely, even if racial passing is accurately treated in the novel, it is considered a historically specific practice and so Passing appears dated and trivial. According to Clark Barwick\u2019s \"A History of Passing,\" Larsen\u2019s novel has been translated into numerous languages including Danish, German, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, and Italian.", "hasanswer": false}]}

[Pop music] is the kind of music that people want from me.\" Minogue believed the album was a new beginning and things came \"almost full circle\" while making it, as she started singing pop music again. Minogue was inspired by the music of the 1970s, which she discovered when she was a child via her parents' record collection, including the soundtrack from Grease , Donna Summer's \"Bad Girls\" and \"Dim All the Lights\" . The label did not want to make another Pete Waterman Limited or \"throwaway pop record\", but quality pop music with the help of great contributions and collaborations. Her team approached PWL owner Pete Waterman, who had worked with Minogue earlier in her career, during the production. However, the collaboration did not happen. Minogue enjoyed making Light Years, getting a chance to work with people who \"came on board straight away\" and were certain how they wanted her to sound. She felt that working with different producers would help the album have a \"diverse feel\" with \"different flavors\". She wanted the album to be song-driven and tried to explain the musical styles to the producers with three keywords: \"poolside\", \"disco\", and \"cocktails\". Minogue worked on Light Years in Sydney, London, and Los Angeles, where she put the final touches on the album. Before signing with Parlophone, Minogue spent a week with her frequent collaborator Steve Anderson at Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, where most of the production of Impossible Princess was done. Three tracks were chosen from the session: \"So Now Goodbye\", \"Butterfly\", and \"Bittersweet Goodbye\". Minogue picked \"Bittersweet Goodbye\" when she was deep in the production process, saying it made her feel \"very still... like [she] was just come out of meditation\". A string arrangement by Wil Malone was added to the track, while Anderson kept Minogue's vocals from the original demo. Chicago-based DJ Mark Picchiotti flew to Los Angeles to record Minogue's vocals for \"Butterfly\", and then produced the track in his hometown. Former Take That member Robbie Williams contributed three songs with his songwriting partner Guy Chambers: \"Loveboat\", \"Your Disco Needs You\", and \"Kids\". Minogue shared the songwriting credit on the first two. She found in Williams her ideal male counterpart based on their similar musical output; she felt the work between Williams and Chamber was extraordinary. Chamber co-wrote another track with Minogue titled \"I'm So High\". They were among the earliest collaborations, which Minogue felt were a \"good foundation\" for the album. Minogue wrote the lyrics to \"Light Years\" with Biffco's songwriters Richard Stannard and Julian Gallagher in 10 minutes. The demo, originally titled \"Light Relief\", was unexpectedly favoured by the label and was picked up for the final tracklist. Minogue co-wrote \"Please Stay\" with Stannard and Gallagher. Minogue made several demos with a set of writers and producers arranged by Brian Rawling, including Steve Torch, Graham Stack, and Mark Taylor. She ended up recording \"On a Night Like This\", a song written originally for the Swedish recording artist Pandora for her 1999 album No Regrets. In New York, A&R executive Jamie Nelson pitched a demo of \"Spinning Around\" to Minogue and she agreed to record it. The track\u2014written by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, Kara DioGuardi, and Paula Abdul\u2014was originally intended to be featured on Abdul's studio album, but it was given to Minogue after the album failed to materialise. Minogue recorded \"Under the Influence of Love\", a song written by Paul Politi and Barry White that Love Unlimited covered in 1974. The track reminded Minogue of her previous songs, despite having not heard it before the production of Light Years. Johnny Douglas wrote and produced \"Password\", \"Disco Down\", and \"Koocachoo\"; he also produced \"So Now Goodbye\", a track that Minogue wrote with Anderson.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the eighth film in the Star Trek film series, the second to star the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the film, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E travel back in time from the 24th century to the mid-21st century to stop the cybernetic Borg from conquering Earth by changing their past. After the release of Star Trek Generations in 1994, Paramount Pictures tasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with developing the next film in the series. Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot, while producer Rick Berman wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period that the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century, after fearing the Renaissance idea would be \"too kitsch\". After two better-known directors turned down the job, cast member Jonathan Frakes was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone who understood Star Trek. The film's script required the creation of new starship designs, including a new USS Enterprise. Production designer Herman Zimmerman and illustrator John Eaves collaborated to make a sleeker ship than its predecessor. Principal photography began with weeks of location shooting in Arizona and California, before production moved to new sets for the ship-based scenes. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as their appearances on the television series. Effects company Industrial Light & Magic rushed to complete the film's special effects in less than five months. Traditional optical effects techniques were supplemented with computer-generated imagery. Jerry Goldsmith produced the film\u2019s score.Star Trek: First Contact was released on November 22, 1996, and was the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend. It eventually made $92 million in the United States and Canada with an additional $54 million in other territories, combining to a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it to be one of the best Star Trek films, and it was the most positively reviewed film in the franchise until being marginally surpassed by the 2009 reboot film. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean-Luc Picard's parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab and the nature of the Borg.

{"id": "164_377", "question": "Who was the producer of The Rainbow?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_41036", "text": "Rainbow is the seventh studio album by American singer Mariah Carey, released on November 2, 1999, by Columbia Records. The album followed the same pattern as Carey's previous two albums, Daydream and Butterfly , in which she began her transition into the urban adult contemporary market. Rainbow contains a mix of hip hop-influenced R&B tracks, as well as a variety of slow ballads. Carey produced the album with David Foster and Diane Warren, who, as well as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, replaced Walter Afanasieff, the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 1990s. As a result of her separation from her husband, Tommy Mottola, Carey had more control over the musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several urban artists and rappers such as Jay-Z, Usher and Snoop Dogg, as well as Missy Elliott, Joe, Da Brat, Master P, 98 Degrees and Mystikal. On Carey's previous album, Butterfly, she began incorporating several other genres, including R&B and hip hop, into her musical repertoire. In order to further push her musical horizons, Carey featured Jay-Z on the album's lead single, the first time in her career that another artist was featured on one of her lead singles. Carey wrote ballads that were closer to R&B than pop for this album, and worked with Snoop Dogg and Usher on songs such as \"Crybaby\" and \"How Much\", respectively, both of which featured strong R&B beats and grooves. Several of the ballads that Carey wrote during this period, including \"Thank God I Found You\" and \"After Tonight\" , mirrored sentiments she experienced in her personal life. The album spawned five singles, two of which became number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, making Rainbow her seventh-consecutive studio album to produce one or more number-one hits. The album's lead single, \"Heartbreaker\", became Carey's fourteenth number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the record charts in Canada and New Zealand. \"Thank God I Found You\", featuring Joe and 98 Degrees, also topped the Billboard Hot 100, but achieved moderate international chart success. The next two singles, \"Can't Take That Away and \"Crybaby\" featuring Snoop Dogg, were released as a double A-side. The songs were at the center of a public feud in between Carey and Sony Music due to the label's alleged weak promotion of the singles. Carey's cover of Phil Collins' \"Against All Odds \" with Westlife peaked at number one in Ireland, Scotland and the UK Singles Chart. Rainbow was well received by music critics, who generally praised Carey's embrace of R&B and hip hop in her music. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 323,000. It was her first album in years to not reach number one. However, within a month, Rainbow was certified triple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , denoting shipments of three million copies within the United States. Internationally, the album peaked at number one in France and Greece, and charted within the top-five positions in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan and Switzerland.

Alex Henderson from AllMusic commended Shakira's songwriting abilities in English, calling it a \"challenge that she handles impressively well. Shakira, it turns out, sings quite convincingly in English,\" and also praised her different mixes of musical styles, saying \"Like Shakira's Spanish-language albums, this self-produced CD is enjoyably eclectic; she successfully combines pop/rock with everything from tango on \"Objection \" and Andean music on \"Whenever, Wherever\" to Middle Eastern music on \"Eyes Like Yours\". He concluded that \"D\u00f3nde Est\u00e1n los Ladrones? remains Shakira's most essential album, but Laundry Service is an excellent English-language debut for the South American vocalist.\" A critic from Billboard also favoured the presence of various musical styles on the album and commented that \"Laundry Service finds the 24-year-old artist unafraid of merging musical flavors,\" and complimented Shakira's vocal talent. Similarly, the Entertainment.ie review of the album deemed the lyrical content \"surreal\" and the production \"no less bizarre [...] imposing breakneck tangos, twanging guitar solos and bizarre raps onto a familiar soft rock template.\" They felt that Laundry Service could not be called a \"great album\", reasoning that \"the line between fascinatingly strange and offputtingly weird is a thin one, and Laundry Service crosses it far too often,\" but also stated that \"Even so, Shakira's star quality can hardly be denied - and in today's increasingly conformist pop industry that deserves at least two cheers.\" Alexis Petridis from The Guardian lauded Shakira's originality, opining that \"In an age of personality-free pop idols, Shakira's glorious eccentricity makes her a true star,\" and commented that \"Every song contains at least one non sequitur so eccentric that it could be the work of 1970s rock surrealist Captain Beefheart\" and \"The music on Laundry Service gives the lyrics a run for their money in the oddball handicap.\" Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs \"displays an attitude to plagiarism that Noel Gallagher would consider cavalier\" and that \"no one could claim Laundry Service was a groundbreaking work of art,\" he concluded that \"its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics are striking and unique. And these days, it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering.\" Music critic Robert Christgau termed Laundry Service \"the Cher album Cher never made\" and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the \"stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Espa\u00f1ol\" and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira's strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield \"results ranging from corking to minging,\" but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying \"the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it.\" At the same time Shakira's album evoked sharp criticism by a number of authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a \"the ultimate in crossover nightmares\" and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying \"Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. \". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as \"generic\". He felt that the album was \"extremely safe\" and speculated that the reason behind the album's \"generic\" sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying \"when I read that she's [Gloria Estefan] helping you with lyrics and he's [Emilio Estefan] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background .\" Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a \"wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion,\" but commented that the involvement of a \"battalion of producers and songwriters\" led to Shakira sounding \"downright silly\" on Laundry Service and also criticised \"her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore.\" Some authors criticised Shakira's first English album for the clumsy rhyme of its songs. Elizabeth Mendez Berry's article in \"Vibe\" is particularly indicative in this sense.  In reference to Shakira's texts in English, the journalist wrote: \"While her Spanish-language albums sparkled with elegant wordplay, this record is rife with cliches, both musically and lyrically. [...] For Anglophone Latin lovers, Shakira's lyrics are best left to the imagination.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ellison bookended the original story with two others in the same world, in Vic and Blood: The Chronicles of a Boy and His Dog , a three-story graphic novel collection illustrated by Richard Corben, who also illustrated for this collection two other short stories featuring Vic and Blood: \"Eggsucker\" and \"Run, Spot, Run\" . Ellison's introduction to the collection explains that 1969's A Boy and His Dog is part of a larger novel that he has been writing for over 30 years and that story is finished, but the last, longest part is written as a screenplay with no current plans for production. Ellison considered as late as 2003 that he would combine the three stories to create a novel with the proposed title of Blood's a Rover . Prior to the publication of Blood's a Rover, the graphic novel's Ellison/Corben edition has been reprinted as Vic and Blood: The Continuing Adventures of a Boy and His Dog. In January 2018, Subterranean Press announced the publication of Blood's a Rover, which combined materials from the author's files, versions of the novella and short stories that have been expanded and revised, material from Corben's graphic novel, and previously unpublished material from the 1977 NBC television series Blood's a Rover, which was never produced.", "hasanswer": false}]}

On a stormy evening, the electricity flickers on and off. Most of the servants, convinced that the house is haunted, have made excuses and fled. According to a news report, a mysterious criminal known as \"the Bat\" has eluded police in the area. Cornelia is in the house with her maid, Lizzie, and Billy, a Japanese butler who is part of Fleming's household staff. They are joined by Brooks, a gardener recently hired by Cornelia's niece, Dale Ogden. Dale and Dr. Wells, the local coroner and an old friend of Fleming's, arrive for a visit. They tell Cornelia that Jack Bailey, a cashier at Fleming's bank, has disappeared and is suspected of stealing over a million dollars. Cornelia tells Lizzie and Dale that she has invited a police detective to visit because someone has been trying to break into the house at night. Wells leaves, and Detective Anderson arrives. Cornelia tells Anderson that she suspects Fleming embezzled from the bank and hid the money in the house. While Cornelia shows Anderson to his room, Dale warns Brooks that Anderson is a detective. Brooks also believes that Fleming hid the money, and wants to clear himself by finding it. Dale summons Fleming's nephew, Richard , to learn about possible hiding places. Richard shows her a blueprint of the house, with a hidden room where the money might be. While they fight over the blueprint, a figure appears in the darkness and shoots Richard, ending the first act. Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to the house to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the blueprint she took from Richard because the others might think that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fianc\u00e9 makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door. When the guests try to identify the unknown man, they discover that they have been locked in the house. At the end of the second act, Cornelia finds the Bat's calling card, a black paper bat, tacked to a door. The third act begins on the upper floor of the house, where a masked man is seen in the previously-hidden room taking a money bag from a safe. When Dale finds the room, the man flees, leaving her and the money locked inside. The others find her there, unconscious. Anderson reappears and accuses Wells of stealing the money and killing Richard. Cornelia begins to present an alternative theory, but is interrupted when the unknown man comes upstairs and Anderson asks him about his amnesia. Cornelia says that she sees a man on the roof, and most of the group leaves to look for him. Cornelia uses the distraction to tell Dale, Jack and the unknown man that she thinks the money is still in the room. When they search for the money, Jack finds the body of Courtleigh Fleming, who was killed only recently. As Cornelia, Dale and Jack argue about what has happened, the unknown man locks the door and orders them to be quiet.

After another face-off called AquaGames, hosted by Kit Hoover and Mark Long, between The Real World: Seattle and Road Rules: Down Under in 1998, the Challenge series was born in 1998 with Road Rules: All Stars, and featured cast members from five seasons of The Real World.

Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death, but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided. With Norman law favouring John as the only surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur as the only son of Henry's elder son, the matter rapidly became an open conflict. John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster Abbey, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent. With Arthur's army pressing up the Loire Valley towards Angers and Philip's forces moving down the valley towards Tours, John's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two. Warfare in Normandy at the time was shaped by the defensive potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns. The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles, such as Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard, at strategic points, built and maintained at considerable expense. It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, which slowed the progress of any attack. Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces. Feudal levies could be raised only for a fixed length of time before they returned home, forcing an end to a campaign; mercenary forces, often called Braban\u00e7ons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could operate all year long and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces. As a result, commanders of the period were increasingly drawing on larger numbers of mercenaries. After his coronation, John moved south into France with military forces and adopted a defensive posture along the eastern and southern Normandy borders. Both sides paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced; John's position was now stronger, thanks to confirmation that the counts Baldwin IX of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne had renewed the anti-French alliances they had previously agreed to with Richard. The powerful Anjou nobleman William des Roches was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John; suddenly the balance seemed to be tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John. Neither side was keen to continue the conflict, and following a papal truce the two leaders met in January 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace. From John's perspective, what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet; by this treaty, Philip recognised John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions, temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client, Arthur. John, in turn, abandoned Richard's former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and Boulogne, and accepted Philip's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of John's lands in France. John's policy earned him the disrespectful title of \"John Softsword\" from some English chroniclers, who contrasted his behaviour with his more aggressive brother, Richard.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It featured thicker sounds, layered saxophones, and vocal textures. It spawned the hit singles \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" , their fourth UK No. 1 , \"Invisible Sun\", and \"Spirits in the Material World\". As the band was unable to agree on a cover picture, the album cover had three red pictographs, digital likenesses of the three band members in the style of segmented LED displays, set against a black background. In the 1980s, Sting and Summers became tax exiles and moved to Ireland while Copeland, an American, remained in England. The group opened and closed the 1981 concert film, Urgh! A Music War. The film, which captured the music scene in the wake of punk, was masterminded by Stewart Copeland's brothers Ian and Miles. The film had a limited release but developed a mythic reputation over the years. At the 1982 Brit Awards in London, the Police received the award for Best British Group. After the Ghost in the Machine Tour concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the \"Ace Face\" in the British drama film Quadrophenia, a film loosely based on The Who's rock opera, followed by a role as a mechanic in love with Eddie Cochran's music in Chris Petit's Radio On. In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the Richard Loncraine film Brimstone and Treacle. He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie's theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit \"Spread a Little Happiness\" . Over 1981 and 1982, Summers recorded his first album with Robert Fripp, I Advance Masked. In 1983, Stewart Copeland composed the musical score for Francis Ford Coppola's film Rumble Fish. The single \"Don't Box Me In \", a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter Stan Ridgway received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Also in 1983, Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role-playing Feyd-Rautha in David Lynch's Dune. As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Stewart Copeland deteriorated.

By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors. With its Rambles, Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain. Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels  including 35 five star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider. While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report, the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, number of visitors had increased from 1.7\u00a0million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62\u00a0million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30\u00a0billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity. A May 2017 article in England's The Telegraph newspaper included Barcelona among the Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop [like Venice]\". To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb with a \u20ac30,000. The mayor has suggested an additional tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors. One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success.\", he said. \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Writers Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline. As promotion for The Avengers, Marvel released an official infographic detailing this timeline in May 2012. When Spider-Man: Homecoming was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of Homecoming into the previous films, such as The Avengers. This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of The Avengers and the events of Civil War, which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed. Additionally, dialogue in Civil War indicates that eight years pass between the end of Iron Man and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years. Infinity War co-director Joe Russo described the Homecoming eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\", and the mistake was ignored in Infinity War which specified that its events were taking place only six years after The Avengers. The public response to the Homecoming mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases, and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years, celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU. This timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of Black Panther and Infinity War by placing them in 2017. Despite the latter apparent mistakes, Thomas Bacon of Screen Rant described the timeline as \"the closest Marvel has yet come to making an official statement on just when the different MCU events are set\", bringing \"some sense of balance to the MCU continuity\". In October 2020, the Marvel section of Disney+ was restructured to include groupings of the films by phase, as well as a grouping that put the films in timeline order. Bacon felt the placement of Thor: The Dark World between The Avengers and Iron Man 3 and Black Panther after Captain America: Civil War in this timeline corrected \"previous issues\" with their placement in the November 2018 First 10 Years timeline, and was glad Disney and Marvel \"recognize[d] it's possible to watch these movies in anything other than release order\", \"legitimiz[ing]\" this viewing experience. The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Spider-Man: Far From Home were excluded since Disney did not have their distribution rights, but Bacon felt The Incredible Hulk could be viewed after Iron Man 2 since it is simultaneous with that film, Homecoming could come after Black Panther, and Far From Home could be viewed after Avengers: Endgame. Julia Alexander at The Verge agreed with Bacon that it \"seems like Disney finally understands how [some viewers] want to watch Marvel movies\". As of January 2022, the Disney+ timeline order is Captain America: The First Avenger, Agent Carter, Captain Marvel, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, Thor, The Consultant, The Avengers, Item 47, Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 3, All Hail the King, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, Loki, What If...?, WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Eternals, and Hawkeye.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The story was based on the 1954 novel D'entre les morts by Boileau-Narcejac. The screenplay was written by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor. The film stars James Stewart as former police detective John \"Scottie\" Ferguson. Scottie is forced into early retirement because an incident in the line of duty has caused him to develop acrophobia and vertigo . Scottie is hired by an acquaintance, Gavin Elster, as a private investigator to follow Gavin's wife Madeleine , who is behaving strangely. The film was shot on location in the city of San Francisco, California, as well as in Mission San Juan Bautista, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, and Paramount Studios in Hollywood. It is the first film to use the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's acrophobia. As a result of its use in this film, the effect is often referred to as \"the Vertigo effect\". Vertigo received mixed reviews upon initial release, but is now often cited as a classic Hitchcock film and one of the defining works of his career. Attracting significant scholarly criticism, it replaced Citizen Kane as the greatest film ever made in the 2012 British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' poll. The film is often considered one of the greatest films ever made. It has appeared repeatedly in polls of the best films by the American Film Institute, including a 2007 ranking as the ninth-greatest American movie of all time. In 1996, the film underwent a major restoration to create a new 70\u00a0mm print and DTS soundtrack. In 1989, Vertigo was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement. Exploiting his embellished frontier legend , Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\". In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign. At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy. On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\". As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South. Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln. As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000\u2013200,000 copies. Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War. Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. His victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Smith initially suggested that the album should be produced by Tom Dowd. Plans were made to book studio time with Dowd at Criteria in Miami, but these were complicated by his relationship with rival label Atlantic Records. Nonetheless, Smith had a change of heart and instead set out to enlist Welsh musician John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, to produce Horses, as she was impressed by the raw sound of his solo albums, such as 1974's Fear. Cale, who had previously seen Smith perform live and was acquainted with her bassist Ivan Kr\u00e1l, accepted. Horses was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with Smith retaining the same backing band with whom she performed live\u2014Jay Dee Daugherty on drums, Lenny Kaye on guitar, Ivan Kr\u00e1l on bass guitar, and Richard Sohl on keyboards. Cale recalled that the band initially \"sounded awful\" and played out of tune due to their use of damaged instruments, forcing him to procure the band new instruments before work on the album began. The differences between the work ethics of Cale, who was an experienced recording artist, and of Smith, who at this point was primarily a live performer, became apparent early on in recording, and were a source of tension between the two artists, who frequently argued in the studio. The sole guest musicians on Horses were Allen Lanier of Blue \u00d6yster Cult and Tom Verlaine of Television. Cale had wished to augment the band's playing on certain songs with strings, but Smith vehemently opposed this idea. Lanier, who was Smith's boyfriend at the time, did not get along with Cale and particularly Verlaine. This tension culminated with Lanier and Verlaine getting into a physical altercation during the final recording session, held on September 18. By the end of recording, and for some years immediately following the album's release, Smith was quick to downplay Cale's contributions and suggested that she and her band had ignored his suggestions entirely. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Smith described the experience: Cale said in 1996 that Smith initially struck him as \"someone with an incredibly volatile mouth who could handle any situation\", and that as producer on Horses he wanted to capture the energy of her live performances, noting that there \"was a lot of power in Patti's use of language, in the way images collided with one another.\" He described their working relationship during recording as \"confrontational and a lot like an immutable force meeting an immovable object.\" Smith would later attribute much of the tension between herself and Cale to her inexperience with formal studio recording, recalling that she was \"very, very suspicious, very guarded and hard to work with\" and \"made it difficult for him to do some of the things he had to do.\" She expressed gratitude for Cale's persistence in working with her and her band and found that his production on Horses made the most out of their \"adolescent and honest flaws\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Difford claims that in 1973, he stole 50p from his mother's purse to put a card in a local sweetshop window to advertise for a guitarist to join his band, although he was not actually in a band at the time. Tilbrook was the only person who responded to the advertisement. Difford and Tilbrook began writing songs together, and soon added Jools Holland and Paul Gunn to form an actual band. The group performed under several names, most frequently \"Captain Trundlow's Sky Company\" or \"Skyco\", before selecting the band name \"Squeeze\" as a facetious tribute to the Velvet Underground's oft-derided 1973 album Squeeze. Gilson Lavis replaced Gunn on drums, and Harry Kakoulli joined on bass in 1975. Squeeze's early career was spent around Deptford in south-east London, where they were part of a lively local music scene which included Alternative TV and Dire Straits. Though the group was initially signed to Miles Copeland III's BTM Records, the label went under in late 1976, and so their early singles and debut EP, 1977's Packet of Three, were released on the Deptford Fun City label. Squeeze's first EP and most of their self-titled debut album were produced by John Cale for A&M Records. Cale had been a member of Velvet Underground from whose album Squeeze took their name. However, the debut album's two hit singles were produced by the band themselves, as the label found Cale's recordings uncommercial. In the United States and Canada, the band and album were dubbed UK Squeeze owing to legal conflicts arising from a contemporary American band called \"Tight Squeeze\". The \"U.K.\" was dropped for all subsequent releases. In Australia, the same name change was used due to legal conflicts arising from an existing Sydney-based band also called \"Squeeze\". Albums in Australia were credited to UK Squeeze up to and including 1985's Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti. The band's second album, Cool for Cats , contained the band's two highest charting UK singles in \"Cool For Cats\" and \"Up The Junction\", both of which peaked at No.\u00a02. John Bentley replaced Harry Kakoulli on bass in 1979 following the release of the LP. Argybargy , the band's third album, was also a UK hit. It was additionally a mild breakthrough in North America, as the single \"Another Nail in My Heart\" was a No.\u00a056 hit in Canada, and second single \"Pulling Mussels \" received airplay on US rock radio stations. The video for the former was frequently shown on independent video music shows in the US. Keyboardist Jools Holland left the band for a solo career in 1980. He was replaced by highly rated singer-keyboardist Paul Carrack, a former member of both British soul-pop band Ace and progressive rock band Roxy Music. In 1981, the band released East Side Story. It was produced by Elvis Costello and Roger Bechirian, and featured Carrack's lead vocals on the radio hit \"Tempted\". Carrack himself left after the release of East Side Story, and was replaced by Don Snow. This line-up recorded the Sweets from a Stranger LP in 1982. Negative reviews, the stresses of touring, drummer Gilson Lavis' drinking, and conflict between band members led Difford and Tilbrook to break up the band later that year, after releasing a final single, \"Annie Get Your Gun\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film's cinematography, editing, score and sound design were also by Lynch, with pieces by a variety of other musicians also featured. Lynch's longtime collaborator and wife Mary Sweeney co-produced the film. The cast includes such Lynch regulars as Laura Dern, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, and Grace Zabriskie, as well as Jeremy Irons, Karolina Gruszka, Peter J. Lucas, Krzysztof Majchrzak, and Julia Ormond. There are also brief appearances by a host of additional actors, including Nastassja Kinski, Laura Harring, Terry Crews, Mary Steenburgen, and William H. Macy. The voices of Harring, Naomi Watts, and Scott Coffey are included in excerpts from Lynch's 2002 Rabbits online project. The title borrows its name from a metropolitan area in Southern California. Released with the tagline \"A Woman in Trouble\", the film follows the fragmented and nightmarish events surrounding a Hollywood actress who begins to take on the personality of a character she plays in a supposedly cursed film production. An international co-production between the United States, France, and Poland, the film was completed over a three-year period and shot primarily in Los Angeles and Poland. The process marked several firsts for Lynch: the film was shot without a finished screenplay, instead being largely developed on a scene-by-scene basis; and it was shot entirely in low-resolution digital video by Lynch himself using a handheld Sony camcorder rather than traditional film stock. Inland Empire premiered in Italy at the Venice Film Festival on 6 September 2006.

This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased . In the story, the Doctor encounters both the Master and the Daleks.

After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players. Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, \"violet buildings\" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game. Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger. Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn.

Welles remained contractually tied to the project as both actor and writer. Eight years later, he was brought in to make the film again by producer Harry Alan Towers who had worked with Welles in radio. Welles still wanted to direct but Towers said he could not get a completion guarantee if that was the case so John Hough was brought in to do the job. Welles starred as Long John Silver and it was shot in Spain with a Spanish crew. Kim Burnfield, who played Jim Hawkins, came from England. Welles said \"A lot of people wanted me to do Treasure Island in Greece. But the colonels have locked up a lot of my friends so naturally I never considered going there. Besides, Spain is my home and this is the place I would rather work.\" National General agreed to provide some finance and distribute in the US. Towers sourced a boat to play the Hispanolia in the Thames. It was a floating restaurant. He arranged for it to be shipped to Spain but it sank. Towers managed to find another boat two weeks before filming. Filming took place in June 1972 in Almeria. According to one contemporary report the director at one stage was Italian Andrea Bianchi who said, \"I knew all about the 'black legend' of Orson Welles. When he is in front of the camera, no matter who is in the director's chair, it is Welles who directs.\" After a tense initial two day period, Welles and Bianchi established a working relationship. Towers says the director was Hough and that he and Welles did not get along. Welles was sufficiently dismissive of the rewrites to his original script that he asked not to be credited, taking the pseudonym \"O.W. Jeeves\". Welles claimed his performance was dubbed by another actor without his permission. Welles did record a dubbing session, but it was over one long night in Paris, and it was felt that Welles' dubbing could not be understood. Because this was only a few weeks before the US release, that version used Welles' voice. However Towers says Nat Cohen who was in charge of the film's release in Britain and on American TV, insisted the voice be dubbed again. They hired Robert Rietty to do the job.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He sold his rights to United Artists, which had released it, and it made back its money. Critical response was mixed, from the New York Herald Tribune'''s four-star \"a magnificent job... Visually and dramatically, The Alamo is top-flight\" to Time magazine's \"flat as Texas\". At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 52% from 21 reviews. The film is thought to have been denied awards because Academy voters were alienated by an overblown publicity campaign, particularly one Variety ad claiming that the film's cast was praying harder for Chill Wills to win his award than the defenders of the Alamo prayed for their lives before the battle. The ad, placed by Wills, reportedly angered Wayne, who took out an ad of his own deploring Wills's tastelessness. In response to Wills's ad, claiming that all the voters were his \"Alamo Cousins\", Groucho Marx took out a small ad which simply said \"Dear Mr. Wills, I am delighted to be your cousin, but I voted for Sal Mineo\" . Wayne provided a clip of the film for use in How the West Was Won. Despite being anachronistic , the clip occurs near the beginning of the second half of the film, as Spencer Tracy narrates the events that led up to the American Civil War. Awards and honorsThe Alamo was nominated for seven Academy Awards . Its successful bid for several Oscar nominations over such films as Psycho and Spartacus was largely due to intense lobbying by producer John Wayne. Chill Wills' aggressive campaign for the Best Supporting Actor award was considered tasteless by many, including Wayne, who publicly apologized for Wills. Wills took out an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter claiming that \"We of the Alamo cast are praying harder - than the real Texans prayed for their lives in the Alamo - for Chill Wills to win the Oscar\". Wayne took out his own advertisement calling the claim \"untrue and reprehensible\" and that he was sure that Wills' \"intentions were not as bad as his taste\". Wills' publicity agent, W.S. \"Bow-Wow\" Wojciechowicz, accepted blame for the ill-advised effort, claiming that Wills had known nothing about it. Alternate versionsThe Alamo premiered at its 70\u00a0mm roadshow length of 202 minutes, including overture, intermission, and exit music, but was cut severely for wide release. UA re-edited it to 167 minutes. The 202-minute version was believed lost until Bob Bryden, a Canadian fan, realized he had seen the full version in the 1970s. He and Alamo collector Ashley Ward discovered the last known surviving print of the 70\u00a0mm premiere version in Toronto, in pristine condition. MGM used this print to make a digital video transfer of the roadshow version for VHS and LaserDisc release. The print was taken apart and deteriorated in storage. By 2007, it was unavailable in any useful form. MGM used the shorter, general release version for subsequent DVD releases. At present, the only existing version of the original uncut roadshow release is on standard definition 480i digital video. It is the source for broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies. The best available actual film elements are of the 35\u00a0mm negatives of the general release version. A restoration of the deteriorating print found in Toronto, supervised by Robert A. Harris, was envisaged but to date is not underway. The endangered version is the 70\u00a0mm uncut roadshow version . The cut 167-minute version still exists in decent condition in 35\u00a0mm. In 2014, an Internet campaign was formed urging MGM to restore The Alamo from the deteriorating 70mm elements. This garnered some publicity from KENS-TV in San Antonio, and attention from filmmakers such as J. J. Abrams, Matt Reeves, Rian Johnson, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. In his 2014 biography of Wayne, John Wayne: The Life and Legend author Scott Eyman states that the full-length Toronto print has deteriorated to the point where it is now unusable.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Extremely introverted, she is teased by Aunt Em for having delayed moving out to start her life as an adult . While Dorothy cleans up after the meal, her dog Toto runs out the open kitchen door into a snowstorm. She succeeds in retrieving him but finds herself trapped in the storm. A magical whirlwind made of snow materializes and transports them to the realm of Oz, depicted as a dystopian version of New York City. As Dorothy descends from the atmosphere she smashes through an electric \"Oz\" sign, which falls upon and kills Evermean, the Wicked Witch of the East who rules Munchkinland. As a result, she frees the Munchkins who populate the playground into which she lands. Dorothy soon meets the Munchkins' main benefactress, Miss One, the Good Witch of the North, a magical \"numbers runner\" who gives her Evermean's charmed silver slippers. Dorothy declares she just wants to get home to Aunt Em. Miss One urges her to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and seek the help of the powerful \"Wiz\" . After telling her never to take the silver shoes off, Miss One and the Munchkins disappear and Dorothy is left to search for the road on her own . The next morning, Dorothy happens upon a scarecrow made of garbage and saves him from being teased by a group of humanoid crows . The Scarecrow hopes the Wiz might be able to give him the one thing he feels that he lacks: a brain.

Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and hangs the Lion up by his tail in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch. The sprinklers put out the fire and melt Evillene. With Evillene dead, her spells lose their power . The Flying Monkeys give Dorothy and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City, where they discover that the Wiz is actually Herman Smith, a failed politician from Atlantic City. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along even as she fears she will never find her own way home.

Wise said, \"I was there to be an aid to him if he wanted to discuss something or whether he felt this kind of angle or editing standpoint was a good one, whether the different angles in a scene were enough coverage. I didn't ever step in when he was staging a scene. Then if I saw something that bothered me, I would get him aside and say, 'Be careful of this or watch for that.

But Major Ruben Prien of the Project still has residual memories of what would have happened.  He is able to put the pieces together. He finds another time traveller, more or less stranded in the present by Morley's actions. The time traveller is able to go to the point where Morley had altered time, and prevent Morley's actions. The original timeline, with the Project, is now back in place. Morley has settled down in the 1880s, married Julia, and works as a graphic artist. He is, however, vaguely dissatisfied with his life. Morley, knowing that he was unable to stop the Project, eventually returns to the 1970s to see what might be going on with the Project, which has in fact become moribund.  Prien soon realizes that Morley is back, and arranges a meeting with him. Prien persuades Morley that it might be possible to prevent World War I, and Morley travels back in time to the year 1912.  Not only does he do it to head off the devastating war, as in the original novel, he has a personal desire to travel in time.  His motive to visit the spring of 1912 is to see the brief-lived vaudeville act, \"Tessie and Ted\", who, we finally learn, are Morley's great aunt\u2014and the father who died when Morley was only two years old.  He sees them, but forgoes any interaction with them.  His primary purpose in visiting 1912 is to find the mysterious \"Z\", a confidential agent of President Taft whose quiet trip to Europe would have assured peace and prevented the World War, had Z not vanished from the scene, after getting the written assurances he needed, but before returning home. Once Z is found, Morely can do whatever is required to prevent Z from vanishing. Morley soon is enveloped in the blissful world of 1912 New York, seemingly meeting at every turn a woman he calls the \"Jotta Girl.\"  Morley is able to eavesdrop on a clandestine meeting between Z and Theodore Roosevelt, and finally realizes that Z is Major Archibald Butt , military aide to both Presidents Roosevelt and Taft, whom Morley has already met in the society of this New York.  He tries to get close to Butt, but is frustrated by the Jotta Girl, who Morley belatedly realizes is an agent of Dr. Danziger, original head of the Project and opponent to Prien.  Danziger, who opposes changing the past for any purpose, has figured out who Z was, and has sent the Jotta Girl to interfere with Morley.  However, Morley does not realize this until Butt is off to Europe on the R.M.S. Mauretania, seemingly ending any chance Morley might have to try to ensure that Butt completes his mission. His purpose frustrated, Morley returns to report to Prien in the 1970s.  It is his intent then to return to Julia in the 1880s, feeling nothing further can be done.  Independently of Morley, Prien has learned that Butt was Z, and knows why Z vanished, his mission incomplete.  Butt sailed on the Titanic and did not survive.  At first, Morley refuses to make another attempt to complete his mission.  He is motivated to try again when Prien informs him of the precise date that Morley and Julia's son, Willy, will die in World War I, killed in action. Morley returns to 1912 and travels to Belfast, where the Titanic is under construction. Seeing no way to sabotage the vessel's construction , Morley has little choice but to await the ship's completion and sail on her himself, having carefully planned to be near one of the lifeboats where men were permitted to board. Aboard, he meets Butt, who spurns Morley's offer to tell him how to get off the ship safely once the iceberg strikes. Butt will not leave a vessel on which women and children may die . The Jotta Girl is also aboard, and after Captain Smith fails to take Morley's warning seriously, agrees to help Morley.  They distract the helmsman, setting the ship onto a new course.  That course is the one which impacts the iceberg and sinks the ship. Had they taken no action, the ship would have missed. Butt's mission fails with his death.  The war will happen, and the only hope Morley has for Willy is that forewarned with the information about the day he is to die, that he will survive. In an epilogue, Morley has returned to 1887, or, by now, 1888.

{"id": "164_455", "question": "Who was the producer of Epic?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_54291", "text": "\"The power of the oral tradition,\" Innis writes, \"implied the creation of a structure suited to its needs.\" That structure consisted of the metres and stock phrases of epic poetry which included the Homeric poems, the Iliad and Odyssey. The epics were sung by professional minstrels who pleased audiences by reshaping the poems to meet the needs of new generations. Innis points out that music was central to the oral tradition and the lyre accompanied the performance of the epic poems. He argues that the Homeric poems reflected two significant developments. The first was the rise of an aristocratic civilization which valued justice and right action over the traditional ties of kinship. The second was the humanization of the Greek gods whose limited powers encouraged belief in rational explanations for the order of things. \"Decline of belief in the supernatural led to the explanation of nature in terms of natural causes,\" Innis writes. \"With the independent search for truth, science was separated from myth.\" Gradually, the flexible oral tradition gave rise to other kinds of poetry. Innis notes that these new kinds of literature \"reflected the efficiency of the oral tradition in expressing the needs of social change.\" Hesiod wrote about agricultural themes, becoming the first spokesman for common people. Innis writes that his poems were produced \"by an individual who made no attempt to conceal his personality.\" In the 7th century BC, Archilochos took poetry a step further when he contributed to breaking down the heroic code of epic poetry. Innis suggests he responded to a rising public opinion while historian J.B. Bury describes him as venting his feelings freely and denouncing his enemies. Innis argues that these changes in poetic style and form coincided with the replacement of Greek kingdoms by republics in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Finally, he mentions the development of shorter, lyric poetry that could be intensely personal as shown in the work of Sappho. This profusion of short personal lyrics likely coincided with the spread of writing and the increasing use of papyrus from Egypt.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_456", "question": "Who was the producer of From Beyond?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_51178", "text": "Gordon had previously worked with both Combs and Crampton on Re-Animator, and he cast them in part because he had become used to working with a company of actors during his time in theater, and felt that doing the same thing with Lovecraft movies would allow the actors to know coming into the shoot that they would be asked to do \"all sorts of odd things\" and thus adapt more quickly to his direction. He was interested in the possibility of making a series of Lovecraft films with the same cast, like Roger Corman's Poe adaptations. Gordon, Combs, and Crampton would work together on a third Lovecraft adaptation in 1995, the direct-to-video Castle Freak, and Gordon would later direct versions of two more of Lovecraft's works: the film Dagon in 2001, and the second episode of the Masters of Horror television series, H. P. Lovecraft's Dreams in the Witch-House, in 2005. Many members of the production staff for Re-Animator also held similar roles in the production of From Beyond, including screenwriter Dennis Paoli, producer Brian Yuzna, executive producer Charles Band, director of photography Mac Ahlberg, and special effects artists John Carl Buechler and John Naulin. Albert Band, who served as the production manager of From Beyond, also makes an uncredited appearance as a wino. Gordon's then-wife Carolyn Purdy-Gordon was cast in a small role in many of Gordon's films, and in From Beyond she played Dr. Bloch, the subject of the notorious eyeball-sucking scene. From Beyond was shot in Italy with an Italian crew in order to save money. Gordon says that the film would have cost fifteen million dollars to make in the United States, whereas the foreign production enabled him to hold costs to approximately two and a half million dollars. It was shot on a soundstage called Dinocitta just outside Rome. Dinocitta was originally constructed by Dino DeLaurentiis, but was seized by the government for nonpayment of taxes, and then sold to Empire Studios. From Beyond was one of the first films shot at that venue during its period of ownership by Empire. Gordon shot his film Dolls at the same time, and it was released the following year. As with his earlier film Re-Animator, Gordon made use of medical advisors to be sure that the actions taken by the doctors and nurses of the film followed proper medical procedures. Four separate special effects teams worked on the effects for From Beyond. According to Yuzna, the production ran out of money before the effects on the finale could be finished. According to Gordon, securing an \"R\" rating from the MPAA was a challenging ordeal. He quotes them as initially saying his presented cut of the film had \"ten times too much of everything\". He was ultimately able to get away with making small trims, and without removing any entire sequences from the film. The special effects were created by John Carl Buechler.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She is frequently berated for breaking any of his house rules, as well as for her lack of looks and confidence, even though she is a wealthy girl who lives in a large, beautifully decorated house and attends a private school. Her only source of kindness at home is her mother, Dilys \"Dilly\" Cookson. Beauty adores rabbits, although Gerry forbids her from having pets. Her favorite television show is \"Rabbit Hutch\", a show for young children about a man, Sam, and his pet rabbit, Lily. Beauty has no friends at all at school. The only student that is nice to her is Rhona, Skye's best friend. However, Rhona desperately wants to be friends with Beauty, which she reveals one day when Skye is at a dentist appointment. Finally, Beauty is invited to a birthday party Rhona is holding. For the birthday party, Gerry forces her to get corkscrew curls, and popular bullies Skye, Arabella and Emily develop a new nickname for her: Ugly Corkscrew. Beauty tells her mother about the teasing and Dilly decides to learn how to bake cookies, even though she is an awful cook, in the hope that Beauty will be given a new nickname, Cookie . Gradually, both Beauty and Dilly get the hang of making cookies and become wondrous at it. Gerry refuses to acknowledge any of this completely doubting Dilly's ability to cook anything at all. Beauty's birthday is approaching and she is dreading it, however Gerry appears to turn over a new leaf and act like an ideal father. Gerry arranges a birthday feast and organizes tickets for all of the girls in her class to see a stage show called 'Birthday Bonanza', with a chauffeur driven limousine to escort them there. Her mother buys a beautiful Victorian-style dress for her, and Beauty invites all the girls, including Skye, and Dilly decides to give out cookies at the end of the party, which Gerry spitefully crushes into crumbs. Rhona gives Beauty a pet rabbit, which she names 'Birthday'. The party soon becomes miserable when, at the show, Beauty feels too shy to go onstage , and Gerry shouts at her in the limousine after all the girls leave.

She lets them stay for the night until they decide to go on holiday. The holiday resort to which they go is called Rabbit Cove, which Beauty chooses due to her love of rabbits. They find their way to an idyllic seaside resort run by a kind older man named Mike, a painter who takes Dilly on as a breakfast chef in his B&B. Dilly decides to let Gerry know where they are, despite Beauty's objections, but after he shouts at her and calls her a \"useless aging dumb blonde\" she terminates the call. Gerry tracks them down, and yells at them in front of the customers at the caf\u00e9, even going as far as to accuse Dilly of having an affair with Mike and then to punch him in the nose, before driving off. Even though Dilly is living with Mike and he hints that he wants to start dating, Dilly refuses for the time being, as she wants to be independent. He understands.

Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, Washington led the Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War, and presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the Constitution of the United States and a federal government. Washington has been called the \"Father of the Nation\" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the country. Washington's first public office was serving as official Surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia from 1749 to 1750. Subsequently, he received his initial military training during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress. Here he was appointed Commanding General of the Continental Army. With this title, he commanded American forces in the defeat and surrender of the British at the Siege of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War. He resigned his commission after the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783. Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution of the United States. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including the title \"Mr. President\", and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on republicanism. Washington was a slaveowner who had a complicated relationship with slavery.  During his lifetime he controlled a total of over 577 slaves, who were forced to work on his farms and wherever he lived, including the President's House in Philadelphia. As president, he signed laws passed by Congress that both protected and curtailed slavery. His will said that one of his slaves, William Lee, should be freed upon his death, and that the other 123 slaves must work for his wife and be freed on her death. She freed them during her lifetime to remove the incentive to hasten her death. He endeavored to assimilate Native Americans into the Anglo-American culture but fought indigenous resistance during instances of violent conflict. He was a member of the Anglican Church and the Freemasons, and he urged broad religious freedom in his roles as general and president. Upon his death, he was eulogized by Henry \"Light-Horse Harry\" Lee as \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\". Washington has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media, geographical locations, including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and polls rank him among the greatest U.S. presidents. In 1976 Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies of the United States. Early life The Washington family was a wealthy Virginia planter family that had made its fortune through land speculation and the cultivation of tobacco. Washington's great-grandfather John Washington emigrated in 1656 from Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England, to the English colony of Virginia where he accumulated  of land, including Little Hunting Creek on the Potomac River. George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia, and was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington. His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler. The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1735. In 1738, they moved to Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia on the Rappahannock River. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon. Washington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at Appleby Grammar School in England, but did attend the Lower Church School in Hartfield. He learned mathematics, trigonometry, and land surveying and became a talented draftsman and map-maker. By early adulthood, he was writing with \"considerable force\" and \"precision\"; however, his writing displayed little wit or humor. In pursuit of admiration, status, and power, he tended to attribute his shortcomings and failures to someone else's ineffectuality. Washington often visited Mount Vernon and Belvoir, the plantation that belonged to Lawrence's father-in-law William Fairfax. Fairfax became Washington's patron and surrogate father, and Washington spent a month in 1748 with a team surveying Fairfax's Shenandoah Valley property. He received a surveyor's license the following year from the College of William & Mary. Even though Washington had not served the customary apprenticeship, Fairfax appointed him surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia, and he appeared in Culpeper County to take his oath of office July 20, 1749. He subsequently familiarized himself with the frontier region, and though he resigned from the job in 1750, he continued to do surveys west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. By 1752 he had bought almost  in the Valley and owned . In 1751, Washington made his only trip abroad when he accompanied Lawrence to Barbados, hoping the climate would cure his brother's tuberculosis. Washington contracted smallpox during that trip, which immunized him and left his face slightly scarred. Lawrence died in 1752, and Washington leased Mount Vernon from his widow Anne; he inherited it outright after her death in 1761. Colonial military career Lawrence Washington's service as adjutant general of the Virginia militia inspired his half-brother George to seek a commission. Virginia's lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie, appointed George Washington as a major and commander of one of the four militia districts. The British and French were competing for control of the Ohio Valley. While the British were constructing forts along the Ohio River, the French were doing the same\u2014constructing forts between the Ohio River and Lake Erie. In October 1753, Dinwiddie appointed Washington as a special envoy. He had sent George to demand French forces to vacate land that was being claimed by the British. Washington was also appointed to make peace with the Iroquois Confederacy, and to gather further intelligence about the French forces. Washington met with Half-King Tanacharison, and other Iroquois chiefs, at Logstown, and gathered information about the numbers and locations of the French forts, as well as intelligence concerning individuals taken prisoner by the French. Washington was given the nickname Conotocaurius by Tanacharison. The nickname had previously been given to his great-grandfather John Washington in the late seventeenth century by the Susquehannock. Washington's party reached the Ohio River in November 1753, and were intercepted by a French patrol. The party was escorted to Fort Le Boeuf, where Washington was received in a friendly manner. He delivered the British demand to vacate to the French commander Saint-Pierre, but the French refused to leave. Saint-Pierre gave Washington his official answer in a sealed envelope after a few days' delay, as well as food and extra winter clothing for his party's journey back to Virginia. Washington completed the precarious mission in 77 days, in difficult winter conditions, achieving a measure of distinction when his report was published in Virginia and in London.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His mother, who lived at least one year longer than he did, was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany. As previously mentioned, the vast majority of Amenhotep's statuary comes in the form of a funerary idol from this cult during later periods. When being worshiped, he had three deific manifestations: \"Amenhotep of the Town,\" \"Amenhotep Beloved of Amun,\" and \"Amenhotep of the Forecourt,\" and was known as a god who produced oracles. Some of the questions asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir el-Medina, and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod the answer. He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year. During the first month, a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen, which probably means his idol was taken to Deir el-Medina. Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month, and then two more were held in the seventh month. The first was the \"spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep,\" which probably commemorated the day of his death. The second, celebrated for four days at the very end of the month, was the \"great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town.\" Later in Egyptian history, the seventh month, \"Phamenoth\", was named after this festival. Another festival was held on the 27th of the ninth month, and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month, which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhotep's accession to the throne. Further light is shed upon Amenhotep's funerary cult by multiple documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri from the time of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol, including a recitation of a \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw formula, and purifying and sealing the shrine at the end of the day. The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.", "hasanswer": false}]}

GDP annual average growth was 2.9% in 2016 and 2% in 2017. Agriculture has comprised 4% of the economy over the last two decades, while industry contributes 33% and services contribute 63%. Mexico's GDP in PPP per capita was US$18,714.05. The World Bank reported in 2009 that the country's Gross National Income in market exchange rates was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US$1,830.392\u00a0billion, which led to the highest income per capita in the region at $15,311. Mexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006, even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth. The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively. By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy. Although multiple international organizations coincide and classify Mexico as an upper middle income country, or a middle class country Mexico's National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy , which is the organization in charge to measure the country's poverty reports that a huge percentage of Mexico's population lives in poverty. According to said council, from 2006 to 2010 the portion of Mexicans who live in poverty rose from 18%\u201319% to 46% . However, rather than Mexico's economy crashing, international economists attribute the huge increase in the percentage of population living below the country's poverty line to the CONEVAL using new standards to define it, as now besides people who lives below the economic welfare line, people who lacks at least one \"social need\" such as complete education, access to healthcare, access to regular food, housing services and goods, social security etc. were considered to be living in poverty . Said economists do point out that the percentage of people living in poverty according to Mexico's national poverty line is around 40 times higher than the one reported by the World Bank's international poverty line and ponder if it would not be better for countries in the situation of Mexico to adopt internationalized standards to measure poverty so the numbers obtained could be used to make accurate international comparisons. According to the OECD's own poverty line 20% of Mexico's population lives in a situation of poverty. Among the OECD countries, Mexico has the second-highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich, after Chile\u00a0\u2013 although it has been falling over the last decade, being one of few countries in which this is the case. The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average. This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world. According to a 2008 UN report the average income in a typical urbanized area of Mexico was $26,654, while the average income in rural areas just miles away was only $8,403. Daily minimum wages are set annually being set at $102.68 Mexican pesos in 2019. All of the indices of social development for the Mexican Indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average, which is motive of concern for the government. The electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011. The Mexican electronics industry is dominated by the manufacture and OEM design of televisions, displays, computers, mobile phones, circuit boards, semiconductors, electronic appliances, communications equipment and LCD modules. The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009. Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports. Mexico produces the most automobiles of any North American nation. The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities. The \"Big Three\" have been operating in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the 1960s. In Puebla alone, 70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen. In the 2010s expansion of the sector was surging. In 2014 alone, more than $10 billion in investment was committed. In September 2016 Kia motors opened a $1 billion factory in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, with Audi also opening an assembling plant in Puebla the same year. BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan currently have plants in construction. The domestic car industry is represented by DINA S.A., which has built buses and trucks since 1962, and the new Mastretta company that builds the high-performance Mastretta MXT sports car. In 2006, trade with the United States and Canada accounted for almost 50% of Mexico's exports and 45% of its imports. During the first three quarters of 2010, the United States had a $46.0 billion trade deficit with Mexico. In August 2010 Mexico surpassed France to become the 9th largest holder of US debt. The commercial and financial dependence on the US is a cause for concern. The remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United States account for 0.2% of Mexico's GDP which was equal to US$20 billion per year in 2004 and is the tenth largest source of foreign income after oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services. According to Mexico's central bank, remittances in 2008 amounted to $25bn.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was first used on a national flag when the full arms were displayed on the Rhodesian flag that was adopted on 11 November 1968. It then appeared alone on the Zimbabwe Rhodesian flag of 1979, and it is now displayed on the flag of Zimbabwe. The arms of 1924 were initially retained by the Zimbabwean Government until a new coat of arms  were adopted on 12 September 1981. Anyone who has been to Zimbabwe or seen a photograph of a Zimbabwean flag made in Zimbabwe will notice that the Zimbabwe Bird is rendered in the same format as it appeared on the arms of 1924 and as it appeared on the Rhodesian flag of 1968 and the Zimbabwe Rhodesian flag of 1979. They will also notice that the red star on which the bird is placed is a regular star. However, a different, rather flattened version of the bird, sometimes displayed on an irregular, flattened star, is often seen on flags that are manufactured outside of Zimbabwe. The origin of this discrepancy appears to be an illustration of the proposed new flag that was first released by the Zimbabwe Ministry of Information in April 1980, just prior to the country attaining full independence. This illustration showed the bird in a flattened version positioned over an irregular star. The poor quality of the illustration, with the star appearing as irregular on the flag, but regular under the description of the meanings on the right, and with the Zimbabwe Bird being omitted completely from where it should be next to the words The National Emblem, would suggest that it was done in haste and without accuracy. Nevertheless, in the absence of a better source, vexillologists outside of Zimbabwe have used this illustration as the basis for their rendering of the emblem on the flag, which has then been copied by many flag manufacturers outside of Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, flag manufacturers inside Zimbabwe continue to produce flags emblazoned with the original version of the bird sitting on a regular star. As a result, there are now two versions of the bird and star - the flattened one and the regular one.  Since the flag is the national flag of Zimbabwe, it should surely follow that the version as produced and used in the country itself should be regarded the official version.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Part of what helped her win was her commitment to fitness training. Court was dubbed \"The Aussie Amazon\" because she did weights, circuit training and running along sandy hillsides. This training helped keep her relatively injury-free through most of her career. Court won a record 64 Grand Slam tournament titles, including a record 24 singles titles, 19 women's doubles titles and a record 21 mixed doubles titles.

The high school setting of If... was received positively upon release, so Atlus decided to create a dedicated subseries focusing on the inner struggles of young adults. This concept eventually evolved into Persona, and its underlying focus on the \"human soul\" would become a mainstay of the Persona series. The title Megami Ibunroku was designed to show the title's status as a spin-off directly related to the Megami Tensei series, although it was removed for later Persona titles. The Persona system was directly inspired by the Guardian system used in If..., originally designed by future Persona director Katsura Hashino. Veteran Megami Tensei producer Kouji Okada, and character designer Kazuma Kaneko took over these respective staff roles. New to the production team was writer Tadashi Satomi. The script took about a year to write, with the staff going through twenty drafts. The first draft involved the students going on a field trip and being caught in a series of mysterious events. This was one of the more fondly-remembered versions. Shigenori Soejima, a future designer for the series, was involved in designing minor characters and coloring promotional and cover artwork. The main concept behind Persona was a Megami Tensei game that could be enjoyed by people new to the series. The popularity of casual games on the PlayStation was a key factor in making this decision. The development team's focus on Persona resulted in development on Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne coming to a near-halt. Kaneko designed the main cast around multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of the time, along with members of Atlus staff. While the characters wearing the same uniform helped designate them as a single group, it also made them look the same. To balance against this, Kaneko expressed their individuality through accessories. Atlus staff members also made cameos as minor characters. The character of Philemon was based on Carl Jung's titular wise old man archetype, described as a contradictory existence. His appearance in-game was based on paintings of Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou. Multiple ideas and terms used in-game were based on Jungian psychology and archetypes. The Velvet Room, a key gameplay location, was based on the Black Lodge from Twin Peaks. One of the characters focused on by Kaneko was Maki, who was given multiple forms throughout the story. The first versions created were the original Maki, who had been bed-ridden for a long time, and the \"ideal\" version, whose inexperience with the outside world and interactions with others made her an expressionless doll. In addition to these forms, black-clothed \"Aki\" and white-clothed \"Mai\" were created when Maki's personality split, representing her extremes. The true Maki represented balance, so Kaneko made her uniform grey. Because of this, the school uniform had to be grey. To represent her psychological immaturity, she was given a ribbon to represent her girlishness, along with a locket she believes can grant wishes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that \"life goes on\" and end the series with \"their heads held high\". In the finale, Callum Stone has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding. The idea for the series finale came after research showed that rape is used to punish girl gang members. Series Producer Tim Key says \"That is what The Bill has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and we wanted it to be like that right up until the final shot.\" The final location shoot for the finale was carried out at a derelict estate in London which is due to be demolished.

Executive Producer Johnathan Young says \"We feel that London is a part of the show, it's a character within the show and we've really encouraged directors to look for graphic locations that give you a real sense of being part of a big metropolis\".

Libatique, who worked with Aronofsky throughout the 1990s, prepared for over a year for The Fountain when Aronofsky tried to produce the film for the first time. When production restarted on a smaller budget, Libatique felt that the more budget-conscious approach resulted in a better film, \"I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to its core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality.\" Aronofsky planned to have a strong presentation of the thematic movement from darkness into light. He originally sought to show only a silhouette of the man until the second of the film's three acts, but he chose not to be so extreme, wanting to be more communicative to the audience. The movement was presented less aggressively in the film; Jackman's characters are seen in silhouette at the beginning, kept out of key light. In each of the three periods, the lighting on Jackman's characters is initially dim and gradually grows brighter as the storylines unfold. Meanwhile, Weisz's characters are frequently awash with light in the storylines. Libatique described the metaphoric change of the lighting on Jackman's characters, \"We follow the arc of the Thomas character as he gets closer and closer to the truth.\" Aronofsky preferred to use one camera whenever possible, only using a second camera if the scene was more about the setting and could be shot from two distinctly different axes. Libatique said Aronofsky preferred the eyeline match, \"Darren is big on eyelines, and if you sacrifice an eyeline on an angle, he feels it nullifies the shot and de-emphasizes the performances.\" Aronofsky originally intended to have Jackman's characters always moving in an \"unusual\" left-to-right direction across the frame, but the plan was complicated by the spacecraft needing to move upward toward a light source.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In order to finish the film, he is in the Sahara in northern Chad seeking to meet with and interview rebel fighters who are involved in the Chadian Civil War. Struggling to find rebels to interview, he is further frustrated when his Land Rover gets stuck on a sand dune. After a long walk through the desert back to his hotel, a thoroughly dispirited Locke discovers that an Englishman , who has also been staying in the same hotel, and with whom he had struck up a friendship, has died overnight at the hotel from a heart condition. Locke decides to switch identities with Robertson. Posing as Robertson, Locke reports his own death at the front desk, where the hotel manager mistakes Locke for Robertson, and the plan goes off without a hitch. In London, Locke's wife Rachel has been having an affair . She feels guilt-ridden and torn when she is informed of her husband's death, which we see reported as a newspaper obituary. She approaches Locke's friend, Martin , a television producer, in an attempt to get in touch with Robertson to try and learn more about her husband's last days. Meanwhile Locke, posing as Robertson, has flown to Munich with the dead man's belongings, including his appointment book, which directs him to a locker in the airport. It contains a document wallet with a price-list and several photocopied pages illustrating armaments. Apparently on a whim, after leaving the airport Locke follows a white horse and carriage to a wedding in a baroque chapel where he waits at the back of the congregation. Once the wedding has finished and the guests gone, two men who were observing him at the airport enter and ask why he did not contact them in the airport. They ask for \"the documents\" and on showing them the papers from the locker they give him an envelope of money. The second half is to be paid in Barcelona. We conclude that Robertson was gun-running for the same rebels whom Locke had been trying to contact in the Sahara. Prompted by Robertson's diary entries, Locke flies to Barcelona. There he spots his colleague and friend the TV producer Martin as the latter tries to track Robertson down on behalf of the 'widowed' Rachel. Locke encounters an architecture student while trying to hide in a Gaudi building, La Pedrera. He asks her to fetch his belongings from the hotel so that he won't be seen there by Martin, who is casing the lobby. However Martin overhears that she is collecting Locke's baggage, and confronting her outside requests she take him to meet \"Robertson\". She suggests he follow her in a taxi, but by luck she manages to lose him. She and Locke leave Barcelona and become lovers while on the run. Later Locke confesses that he has stolen a dead man's identity. Flush with cash from the down payment on the arms he cannot deliver, Locke is nevertheless drawn to keep a meeting scheduled in Robertson's diary. His appointed contact, however, does not show up. Meanwhile the men arranging the arms deal are abducted, interrogated and beaten by hitmen who, we know from scenes in the London embassy earlier, operate for the Chadian government. Rachel receives Locke's belongings, returned from Africa. Having heard from Martin of his unsuccessful chase of the elusive 'Robertson', Rachel is shocked as she opens Locke's passport to Robertson's photo pasted inside.  It's implicit that she guesses that Locke swapped identities. She heads to Spain to track down Locke. The hitmen trail her. Rachel co-opts the Spanish police in her pursuit but Locke and the student continue to flee. The student helps him to evade them by providing rational advice, but Locke sends her away, instructing her to meet him later in Tangiers. We see her depart by bus for Almeria. Reaching the Gloria hotel in the Spanish town of Osuna, province of Seville, Locke finds out that the student has returned and booked a double room posing as 'Mrs Robertson'. He again tries to persuade her that she had better leave. She exits the hotel with no luggage and dawdles around the dusty square outside. In a long single take we see the rebel agents arrive at the hotel, then depart, just before the police arrive with Rachel Locke. as they enter his room we see that Locke has been murdered. Rachel says to the police officers that she \"never knew\" Locke and abruptly leaves, while the student girl identifies him as 'Robertson'.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Marshall attempted to form a full band including a vocalist, with the intention of turning Intervals into a touring act, but failed to do so. In Time EP With the release of their second EP In Time on October 30, 2012, Marshall was joined by Olly Steele and David Maxim Micic . Sputnik Music gave the EP a 4.0/Excellent rating, suggesting that \"if they find a bit more creativity and increase their originality, they have potential to go down in history as one of the best instrumental prog metal bands. As of now, they are still not on the same level as Animals as Leaders.\" The band released a music video for \"Epiphany\" on April 25, 2013, via Guitar World promotion and YouTube. Following the success of In Time, the band gained endorsement deals from Ernie Ball Music Man, Pearl Drums, Meinl Cymbals, Toontrack, InTune Guitar Picks, and Gruv Gear. Marshall also released playthroughs and lessons for certain songs from the EP. A Voice Within On September 14, 2013, Intervals announced they would be entering the studio with producer Jordan Valeriote on November 4 to begin tracking their upcoming release. Following the studio, Intervals were scheduled to tour Europe with Protest The Hero, TesseracT, and The Safety Fire. On December 30, it was announced that bassist Mike Semesky would be changing his role in the band and provide vocals on the new album; as a result, the album's bass tracks were handled equally by Marshall and Valeriote. The band released Semesky's vocal debut in the form of new single \u2018Ephemeral\u2019 via RevolverMag.com, as well as a revelation that the new album would be titled A Voice Within. Due to the need for Semesky to focus entirely on his vocal performance live, the band hired Henry Selva as their live bassist for their upcoming tours.  The band released a second song from the album, \"The Escape\", on January 23, 2014, and announced that the album would be released on March 4, 2014. On February 26, the band announced that they would be releasing one new song from the album per day until the day of the album's release. The first of these songs was \"The Self Surrendered\". Departure, The Shape of Color, and The Way forward On November 25, 2014, Mike Semesky was announced to have left the band. An instrumental version of A Voice Within was then released on March 3, 2015. On June 23, three months after, Guyader and Sastry announced on Facebook that they would no longer be a part of Intervals. This separation was caused by different expectations about the direction of the band: Marshall then introduced new studio musicians, bassist Cameron McLellan and drummer Travis Orbin , to work on the band's next album. On December 4, 2015, Intervals released The Shape of Color. On October 24, 2017, Intervals announced The Way Forward, a new album with McLellan returning to bass, and new drummer Nathan Bulla, who had been playing live with the band until the release.

Set to be directed by Anatole Litvak, this version would have been set in contemporary Paris, and would have portrayed the Phantom as a psychologically wounded World War I veteran who was physically unharmed, but imagined that he was disfigured. However, development lingered as the studio faced financial problems that resulted in the ousting of the original film's producer Carl Laemmle and his son, Carl Laemmle Jr. Plans for the remake finally surfaced again in November 1941, when Henry Koster became attached to direct. Koster discarded the previous screenplay, and envisioned a new version of the story in which the Phantom was Christine's father. Under Koster, the initial casting included Boris Karloff as The Phantom, Allan Jones as Raoul, and Deanna Durbin as Christine. Eddy was cast after leaving MGM for a two-picture deal with Universal. This led to Durbin refusing the role, not wanting to be compared to Eddy's frequent film partner Jeanette MacDonald, who Durbin admired. Karloff also became unavailable, and Koster also considered Cesar Romero, Feodor Chaliapin, Charles Laughton and Broderick Crawford for the Phantom. However, producer George Waggner eventually fired Koster from the project. After Koster's firing, Arthur Lubin was brought on to direct. Under Lubin, Koster's subplot about the Phantom being Christine's father was jettisoned, because it gave the romantic elements of their relationship incestuous overtones; however, the Phantom's obsession with Christine is not completely stated within the film. Lubin cast Rains in the film almost immediately, saying he was his \"only choice\" for the role. Foster, who had just left Paramount Pictures, was cast after meeting Lubin through a mutual friend, and auditioning for Waggner. Filming began on January 21, 1943.

Prior to her first appearance, Chenoweth was already acquainted with Glee creator Ryan Murphy, having appeared in his 2006 film Running with Scissors. Murphy commented that he loves writing for Chenoweth, and both he and Chenoweth expressed their desire for April to return to Glee in the future, with Chenoweth stating: \"This part is like nothing I've had the chance to do on TV.\" It was confirmed in October 2009 that Chenoweth would reprise the role of April later in the first season, and on March 14, 2010 that her return would occur in \"Home\". While Glee also features Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers declined to give the two scenes together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond \"Home\", Falchuk commented that the producers want to \"have her around as much as possible\", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: \"[When] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back.

In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased . In the story, the Doctor encounters both the Master and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series. Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by \"Time Crash\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor Peter Davison. A set of two mini-episodes, titled \"Space\" and \"Time\" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event. During Children in Need 2011, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need. Children in Need 2012 featured the mini-episode \"The Great Detective\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

During the story development process, several elements of the original novel were dropped or changed. The game was developed by Wolf Team, an independent game development studio founded in 1986. Due to bad experiences at Telenet Japan, the previous employer of multiple Wolf Team members, the staff sought an independent publisher for the game. After an unsuccessful pitch to Enix, they entered a publishing contract with Bandai Namco . Phantasia had a troubled development cycle for the original Super Famicom version, with many creative disagreements between Wolf Team and Namco. The disagreements led to most of the Wolf Team staff leaving after the game in order to start a new company, tri-Ace, which would go on to make the Star Ocean series. Remaining members would continue to develop games in the Tales series. The studio remained independent until 2003, when it was acquired by Bandai Namco and renamed Namco Tales Studio. The studio's shares were divided between Bandai Namco, Telenet Japan and series director Eiji Kikuchi. In 2006, Namco bought Telenet's shares, then later Kikuchi's, giving them full control over the studio. In mid 2011, a financial report indicated that Namco Tales was in serious financial trouble, having a debt of 21 million dollars and posting a loss for the previous financial year. The studio's absorption into its parent company was formally announced in November of that year.

Because of strict British employment laws for juvenile actors, a succession of actresses took on the lead role every four months. One of the last girls to perform the role at the Victoria Palace before the show went on tour was 10-year-old Claudia Bradley from Leeds who was featured on a 1981 BBC program called Fame. Broadway revival A 20th anniversary Broadway revival, which played at the Martin Beck Theatre in 1997, entitled Annie, the 20th Anniversary, starred Nell Carter as Miss Hannigan, but controversy surrounded the casting of the titular character. The original actress cast in the role, Joanna Pacitti, was fired and replaced by her fellow orphan, Brittny Kissinger just two weeks before her Broadway debut, while battling bronchitis in Boston. The Pre-Broadway Tour was playing the Colonial Theatre. 'Annie' Understudy and Swing Orphan Alexandra Keisman performed the role the first night Pacitti was absent. The producers then gave Kissinger the next performance. The show then moved on to the Oakdale in Connecticut where an insert was placed in the Playbill claiming \"The role of Annie is now being played by Brittny Kissinger\". Public sentiment seemed to side with Pacitti as she was the winner of a highly publicized contest to find a new Annie, sponsored by the department store Macy's. This incident, coupled with the mixed reviews the new staging garnered, doomed it to a short run, although it was followed by a successful national tour. Kissinger, then 8, became the youngest actress to ever play Annie on Broadway. More controversy surrounding the show involved Nell Carter. Carter reportedly was very upset when commercials promoting the show used a different actress, Marcia Lewis, a white actress, as Miss Hannigan. The producers claimed that the commercials, which were made during an earlier production, were too costly to reshoot. Carter felt that racism played a part in the decision. \"Maybe they do not want audiences to know Nell Carter is black\", she told the New York Post. However, the ads did mention that Carter was in the show. \"It hurts a lot\", Carter told the Post, \"I've asked them nicely to stop it \u2014 it's insulting to me as a black woman.\" Later reports stated that \"Nell Carter of Broadway's 'Annie' denied Thursday that she called her show's producers racist because they chose to air commercials featuring a previous Miss Hannigan\u2014who is white\u2014instead of her.\" Her statement, released by the Associated Press, read: \"'Yes, it is true that I and my representatives have gone to management on more than one occasion about the commercial and were told that there was nothing they could do about it,' Carter said in a statement Thursday. 'Therefore, I have resigned myself to the fact that this is the way it is.' The statement also addressed the alleged charges of racism, first published in Thursday's New York Post. Carter is black. 'I, Nell Carter, never, ever, ever accused my producers or anyone in the show of racism,' she said. Producers have said it is too expensive to film a new commercial.\" Carter was later replaced by another white actress, Sally Struthers. The revival closed on October 19, 1997, after 14 previews and 239 performances. West End revival The show was revived at the Victoria Palace, running from September 30, 1998, to February 28, 1999.

{"id": "164_501", "question": "Who was the producer of The Interview?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_38364", "text": "Landreth spent several years developing the film. Instead of first creating a storyboard on which the animation would be based, he conceived the theme after interviews with Larkin. After the screenplay was developed, the production followed a more typical process of creating a storyboard, character modelling, scene design, animation, and post-production. In February 2001, Landreth contacted producer Steven Hoban at Copper Heart Entertainment. Hoban liked the concept for the film, and wanted to include it as a 3D rendering in the IMAX film CyberWorld he was producing. A manager rejected the idea, as the subject material was deemed to be inappropriate for CyberWorld's young target audience. A production team was assembled with Copper Heart Entertainment, and it received a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts. The National Film Board of Canada agreed to be a co-producer. Landreth also secured studio space at the Animation Arts Centre of Seneca College in Toronto, and in 2003 four graduates and fifteen undergraduates from its 3D Animation program were recruited to work on the film. The core development team consisted of one computer graphics supervisor, four animators, one texture mapper, one renderer, two set modellers, and a few character modellers. In the summer of 2001, he conducted several interviews with Larkin, who gave Landreth carte blanche for the project. Landreth accumulated about 20 hours of audio footage, but did not think it was sufficient material on which to base a story, so in August he interviewed him again, this time asking about his alcoholism. Larkin, who had been drinking throughout the interview, responded angrily, and this would become the \"climactic moment in the film\". This led Landreth to change the production from a story primarily narrated by Larkin to an interview-style cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary in which Landreth's character had a larger role. Landreth acquired a comprehensive set of Larkin's works from the National Film Board of Canada and other reference material. He also conducted interviews with Felicity Fanjoy, who had been Larkin's girlfriend in the past, and Derek Lamb, who directed films at the NFB and was a producer for Larkin in the 1970s. He used the interviews and reference material to create a script, which he completed by December. The animation used the technique of psychological realism, blending dialogue from interviews with subjective screen characters who are \"sometimes fragmented, distorted, or in some way unusual\". The representation of the characters was partly inspired by Body Worlds, a travelling exhibition of human bodies preserved by plastination to reveal internal anatomical structures. Landreth has stated that Larkin's character in the film is a subjective interpretation based on his own ideology and experiences, citing one of his favourite quotations \"we don't see things as they are, we see things as we are\". He animated Larkin as a beaten character \"battered by years of substance abuse and still bearing the scars of his artistic failure\". Landreth stated that the visual appearance of the characters \"reflect pain, insanity, fear, mercy, shame, and creativity\", and that the effect was to show the characters' \"souls or mental states or psyches\". Landreth incorporated Larkin's alcoholism as part of the narrative of the film, at first in the background as Larkin sips from a thermos, and later directly as Landreth asks Larkin about his alcoholism. The attention to Larkin's alcoholism also reflects Landreth's mother's troubles with alcohol. Pre-production and production took about 18 months. Use of the Seneca College computing infrastructure, which was loaned for free for the production, was valued by NFB producer Marcy Page at about .

Among the specially invited audience of the taping were Hank Azaria, who played Phoebe's scientist boyfriend David in several episodes over the years; David Arquette, who filmed his then-wife Cox and the others backstage with a video camera; and Wheeler. Missing was Brad Pitt, Aniston's then-husband; Pitt told the producers he wanted to be surprised when the finale aired on television. Although some guests were invited, around 75% of the studio audience were 'ordinary' members of the public so that their reactions would be congruous with the rest of the series. However, friends, family and colleagues of the cast and crew served as extras throughout the episode.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_515", "question": "Who was the producer of Threat?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_48682", "text": "The film was produced by Kings Mob, a team of neophyte filmmakers in their late teen and early 20s. Director Matt Pizzolo was the eldest member of the crew: 19 years old when he wrote the script and 21 when shooting commenced. Pizzolo met filmmaking partner Katie Nisa at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Both were enrolled in the school's Dramatic Writing Program. Pizzolo left the program and lived out of a backpack in Manhattan's Lower East Side while writing the first draft of Threat. Still at NYU, Nisa recruited film student Benjamin Brancato to join the project as cinematographer and NYU business school student Carlos Puga to play the lead role. Pizzolo recruited fellow Long Island native Ben Knight who was still a teenager at the time and put him to work as a production designer for the film. Nisa also cast Keith Middleton when she saw him walking on St. Mark's Place. Unknown to Nisa, Middleton was on his way to perform in the popular dance show Stomp. Kings Mob shot the film in a DIY style that sharply contrasted with other more polished independent films of the mid 90s . The DIY style focused less on aesthetic and more on authenticity. This style later picked up traction with various DiY-Video movements including the mumblecore scene of the 2000s. Unlike most movies of the DIY-Video era to follow, Threat was shot on 16mm film. Pizzolo interned at NYC film co-op Film/Video Arts, where he cleaned up after film classes in exchange for free access to cameras and lights while not in use. Nisa waitressed at East Village diner 7A to pay for production supplies that \"couldn't be borrowed or stolen.\" Initially, sound recording was to be handled by one of Nisa's film student friends. When he could not make it to the first day of production, he instead gave Nisa a 15-minute lesson on how to run the nagra. She went on to be the film's sole sound recordist for the first months of production. At the start of production, the crew consisted solely of Pizzolo, Nisa, Brancato, and Knight but over the course of production it grew to include over 200 young people from 5 different countries. Although shot without permits on a shoestring budget by a team of non-professional first-time filmmakers, some critics have compared Threat to such iconic films as The Warriors, Do the Right Thing, American History X, Slacker, Clerks, Romper Stomper, Kids, Doom Generation, and Suburbia. Critical response ranged from \"easily one of the most important films of the decade\" to \"there is no explanation, no logic, and no reckoning.\" Produced largely in the New York metalcore and hardcore punk scene, Threat features guest appearances by members of Most Precious Blood from the Trustkill Records label. Trustkill also contributed music to the film's score from Most Precious Blood, Bleeding Through, Eighteen Visions, and Terror. Most of the film's score, however, was composed by Alec Empire and his band Atari Teenage Riot. The score was constructed by jungle-music producer queque. In keeping with the punk and DiY ideologies of the movie and their production company, Pizzolo and Nisa eschewed distribution offers from Hollywood studios. Initially, the film was released as an underground VHS tape and toured across the US and Europe, playing at non-traditional venues such as record stores, hip hop clubs, skateparks, and music festivals. One of the more notable non-traditional screenings took place during the Sundance Film Festival at a Doc Martens shoe store across the street from Sundance's flagship Egyptian Theater. It was here that The Daily Telegraph documented the sold-out screenings during Sundance as a cover story in its Saturday Magazine, leading the filmmakers to be invited on a European tour with the film. When they returned home, Threat screenings were added as an attraction on the Van's Warped Tour. Years of touring culminated with an appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where music-video distributor HIQI Media signed on to distribute the film to theaters. Soon after, Pizzolo formed the punk cinema label Halo 8 and released Threat on DVD through a distribution deal with Sony Pictures and RED Music, who distributed the film's soundtracks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Agriculture represents 5.4% of GDP . Cear\u00e1 exports: leather footwear   20.3%, crustaceans 17.6%, woven of cotton 16.9%, cashew 14.7%, leather 13.1%, fruits, juices and honey 5.4% .  It is one of only three Brazilian states which together produce the world's entire supply of carnauba wax. Share of the Brazilian economy: 2,04% . According to the data from IPECE and IBGE, the GDP growth of the State of Cear\u00e1 in 2014 was of 4.36%, while Brazil's overall GDP grew only 0.1% in the same year. Traditionally an agriculture-based state, Cear\u00e1 began an industrialisation program under the military regime , and the industrial sector continues to expand annually. In 1999, industry accounted for 39.3% of the state's GDP. Tourism also plays a large role in Cear\u00e1's economy, with the state's many waterfalls, beaches and rainforests. On average, Fortaleza alone receives half a million tourists annually. In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of cashew nuts, coconut, papaya, melon and beans. The production of cashew in Brazil is carried out almost exclusively in the Northeast. The area occupied by cashew trees in Brazil in 2017 was estimated at 505,500 ha; of this total, 99.5% is located in the Northeast. The main producers in this region are Cear\u00e1 , Rio Grande do Norte and Piau\u00ed. However, Brazil, which in 2011 was the fifth largest world producer of cashew nuts, in 2016, fell to 14th position, with 1.5% of the total volume of nuts produced in the world. Vietnam, Nigeria, India and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were the world's largest cashew nut producers in 2016, with 70.6% of global production. In recent years, there has been increased competition with some African countries, where government programs have driven the expansion of culture and processing capacity. It is estimated that at 295 thousand tons per year the installed capacity for processing cashew nuts in the Northeast, however, the Region only managed to produce around a quarter of that quantity. Among the main world producers, Brazil has the lowest productivity. Several factors are pointed out as the cause of the low productivity and the fall in the Brazilian production of cashew nuts. One reason is that most orchards are in a phase of natural decline in production. In addition, the giant cashew trees, which are the majority in the Region, are exploited in an almost extractive manner, with low use of technology. In 2017, the Northeast Region was the largest producer of coconut in the country, with 74.0% of national production. Bahia produced 351 million fruits, Sergipe, 234 million, and Cear\u00e1 187 million. However, the sector has been suffering strong competition and losing market to Indonesia, the Philippines and India, the world's largest producers, who even export coconut water to Brazil. In addition to climatic problems, the low productivity of coconut palms in the Northeast Region is the result of factors related to the variety of coconut harvested and the technological level used in coastal regions. In these areas, the semi-extractive cultivation system still prevails, with low fertility and without the adoption of cultural management practices. The three states that have the largest production, Bahia, Sergipe and Cear\u00e1, present a yield three times lower than that of Pernambuco, which is in 5th place in the national production. This is because most of the coconut trees in these three states are located in coastal areas and cultivated in semi-extractivist systems. In 2018, the South Region was the main producer of beans with 26.4% of the total, followed by the Midwest , Southeast Region , Northeast and North . The largest producers in the Northeast were Cear\u00e1 and Bahia. In cassava production, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. Maranh\u00e3o was the 7th largest producer in the country, with 681 thousand tons. Cear\u00e1 was 9th, with 622 thousand tons. In total, the northeast produced 3,5 million tons. Rio Grande do Norte is the largest producer of melon in the country. In 2017 it produced 354 thousand tons. The Northeast region accounted for 95.8% of the country's production in 2007. In addition to Rio Grande do Norte, which in 2005 produced 45.4% of the country's total, the other 3 largest in the country were Cear\u00e1, Bahia and Pernambuco. In the production of papaya, in 2018 Bahia was the 2nd largest producer state in Brazil, almost equaling with Esp\u00edrito Santo. Cear\u00e1 was in 3rd place and Rio Grande do Norte in 4th place. In the production of banana, in 2018 Cear\u00e1 was the 8th largest national producer, with 408 thousand tons. The state stands out nationally in raising goats and sheep. In 2016, Cear\u00e1 had the fourth largest herd of goats in the country, with 1.13 million heads. The state occupied the same position in the herd of sheep, with 2.31 million animals. Cear\u00e1's cattle herd is small compared to other states in Brazil. In 2019, it had 2.4 million heads. Milk production was 705 million liters this year. In 2017, the Northeast was the largest shrimp producer in the country. National production was 41 thousand tons. Rio Grande do Norte and Cear\u00e1 were the largest producers. Aracati, in Ceara, was the municipality with the highest participation. About industry, Cear\u00e1 had in 2017 an industrial GDP of R$ 22.2 billion, equivalent to 1.9% of the national industry. It employs 296,734 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Construction , Industrial Public Utility Services, such as Electricity and Water , Food , Leather and footwear and Clothing . These 5 sectors concentrate 75.7% of the state's industry. The main sectors of the Cear\u00e1 industry are clothing, food, metallurgy, textiles, chemicals and footwear. Most of the industries are installed in the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza, where the Industrial District of Maracana\u00fa is located. In S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Amarante, a steel mill is installed, Companhia Sider\u00fargica do Pec\u00e9m, which in 2018 produced 2.9 million tons of crude steel, of the 35.4 million produced in the country. Some of the large companies in Cear\u00e1 with national reach are: A\u00e7o Cearense , Companhia de Alimentos do Nordeste , Grendene , Caf\u00e9 Santa Clara , Grande Moinho Cearense , Edson Queiroz Group , Naval Industry of Cear\u00e1, J. Mac\u00eado, M. Dias Branco and Ypi\u00f3ca. The state is generally poor. According to 2013 data, 396,370 people live in slums in Fortaleza. Fortaleza has the 2nd largest population in a slum among cities in the Northeast. 31.6% of residents have income per capita up to half the minimum wage.

Timbaland was on tour with Justin Timberlake to promote Timberlake's 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds, which Timbaland had also produced. After completing a show in Chicago, they joined Rihanna in the studio, where Timberlake experimented with beats and melodies. Weeks later, the three got together in New York City, where Timberlake had already conceptualized a song for Rihanna. Timbaland, who wanted to compose a song called \"Rehab\" for Rihanna, was producing a beat, when Timberlake came in and improvised the song over it. Hannon Lane co-wrote and co-produced the song, and Demacio Castellon recorded and mixed it in 2007 at Roc The Mic Studios in New York City. Rihanna's stint with Timbaland also resulted in \"Sell Me Candy\" and \"Lemme Get That\", produced for Good Girl Gone Bad. Timberlake told Entertainment Weekly that he believed \"Rehab\" to be \"the bridge for [Rihanna] to be accepted as an adult in the music industry\". Rihanna told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that she enjoyed working with Timberlake, and learned much from the sessions. She said, \"Working with Justin in the studio is just great. He's a fun guy and likes to make all the sessions enjoyable. He's also such a genius when it comes to lyrics.\" \"Rehab\" was the eighth and final single to be released from Rihanna's third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad . According to American music magazine Rap-Up, both \"Breakin' Dishes\" and \"Rehab\" were potential single releases, but \"Rehab\" was chosen. Def Jam Recordings released the song for airplay on contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 6,\u00a02008. On November 3,\u00a02008, it was released to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio stations. The single was released in the UK by Mercury Records on December 8, 2008, as a CD single containing both the album version and an instrumental version of \"Rehab\". On the same date, it was released as a digital download in Ireland. A live performance of the song, recorded in Manchester during Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour , was released for download on the UK and Ireland iTunes Stores. The performance was featured on Rihanna's DVD Good Girl Gone Bad Live. On December 12,\u00a02008, the song and its instrumental version were released on iTunes and 7digital in ten countries, including Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland. In January 2009, it was released as a CD single in Germany, with the same material as in the UK release.

He was contracted to work with various artists and remix their songs, which would be available for Verizon customers to download at no extra cost. \"Rehab\" was the first song remixed for the project, and this version was released in Canada and the US on May 19, 2009, via iTunes.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_522", "question": "Who was the producer of Look Around You?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_74621", "text": "To \"sign off\" the series, the producers considered that they could \"blow everything up\" but ruled that out because they wanted to do something that \"celebrated what The Bill has always been about which is ordinary people wearing a uniform and taking responsibility for society\". The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that \"life goes on\" and end the series with \"their heads held high\". In the finale, Callum Stone has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding. The idea for the series finale came after research showed that rape is used to punish girl gang members. Series Producer Tim Key says \"That is what The Bill has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and we wanted it to be like that right up until the final shot.\" The final location shoot for the finale was carried out at a derelict estate in London which is due to be demolished.  The Bill was always filmed on location in London whenever possible, \"to keep the show authentic\".  Executive Producer Johnathan Young says \"We feel that London is a part of the show, it's a character within the show and we've really encouraged directors to look for graphic locations that give you a real sense of being part of a big metropolis\".  Examples of these would include police chases by boat along the River Thames and helicopters aiding searches. The police uniforms used in The Bill are authentic so when not in use they are locked away.  The uniforms were originally bought from the police who agreed to buy the uniforms back when the series ended. The final scene was a long take, filmed using a hand-held camera and featured 70 people in total.  Of the final scene, Keys said that the producers knew they had to do \"something special\" but also wanted to show that \"life goes on\".  To film the final scene, the cameraman had to keep the camera steady when following the characters going through the police station and then outside into the rear yard of the station where he stepped into a crane which then lifts to reveal the front of Sun Hill station. The shows producers were also included in the final scene, and played the part of journalists at the press conference hosted by Jack Meadows which Keys described as being \"eerie\" because \"you were sat there on the front row listening to Simon making a very moving speech that sums up the show and his time in it\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Yusuf assumes that he will easily find work as a sailor, but there are no jobs, and he has no sense of direction or energy. Meanwhile, Mahmut, despite his wealth, is aimless too: his job, which consists of photographing tiles, is dull and inartistic, he can barely express emotions towards his ex-wife or his lover, and while he pretends to enjoy intellectual filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky, he switches channels to watch porn as soon as Yusuf leaves the room. Mahmut attempts to bond with Yusuf and recapture his love of art by taking him on a drive to photograph the beautiful Turkish countryside, but the attempt is a failure on both counts.

Instead of first creating a storyboard on which the animation would be based, he conceived the theme after interviews with Larkin. After the screenplay was developed, the production followed a more typical process of creating a storyboard, character modelling, scene design, animation, and post-production. In February 2001, Landreth contacted producer Steven Hoban at Copper Heart Entertainment. Hoban liked the concept for the film, and wanted to include it as a 3D rendering in the IMAX film CyberWorld he was producing. A manager rejected the idea, as the subject material was deemed to be inappropriate for CyberWorld's young target audience. A production team was assembled with Copper Heart Entertainment, and it received a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts. The National Film Board of Canada agreed to be a co-producer. Landreth also secured studio space at the Animation Arts Centre of Seneca College in Toronto, and in 2003 four graduates and fifteen undergraduates from its 3D Animation program were recruited to work on the film. The core development team consisted of one computer graphics supervisor, four animators, one texture mapper, one renderer, two set modellers, and a few character modellers. In the summer of 2001, he conducted several interviews with Larkin, who gave Landreth carte blanche for the project. Landreth accumulated about 20 hours of audio footage, but did not think it was sufficient material on which to base a story, so in August he interviewed him again, this time asking about his alcoholism. Larkin, who had been drinking throughout the interview, responded angrily, and this would become the \"climactic moment in the film\". This led Landreth to change the production from a story primarily narrated by Larkin to an interview-style cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary in which Landreth's character had a larger role. Landreth acquired a comprehensive set of Larkin's works from the National Film Board of Canada and other reference material. He also conducted interviews with Felicity Fanjoy, who had been Larkin's girlfriend in the past, and Derek Lamb, who directed films at the NFB and was a producer for Larkin in the 1970s. He used the interviews and reference material to create a script, which he completed by December. The animation used the technique of psychological realism, blending dialogue from interviews with subjective screen characters who are \"sometimes fragmented, distorted, or in some way unusual\". The representation of the characters was partly inspired by Body Worlds, a travelling exhibition of human bodies preserved by plastination to reveal internal anatomical structures. Landreth has stated that Larkin's character in the film is a subjective interpretation based on his own ideology and experiences, citing one of his favourite quotations \"we don't see things as they are, we see things as we are\". He animated Larkin as a beaten character \"battered by years of substance abuse and still bearing the scars of his artistic failure\". Landreth stated that the visual appearance of the characters \"reflect pain, insanity, fear, mercy, shame, and creativity\", and that the effect was to show the characters' \"souls or mental states or psyches\". Landreth incorporated Larkin's alcoholism as part of the narrative of the film, at first in the background as Larkin sips from a thermos, and later directly as Landreth asks Larkin about his alcoholism. The attention to Larkin's alcoholism also reflects Landreth's mother's troubles with alcohol. Pre-production and production took about 18 months. Use of the Seneca College computing infrastructure, which was loaned for free for the production, was valued by NFB producer Marcy Page at about .

Welles still wanted to direct but Towers said he could not get a completion guarantee if that was the case so John Hough was brought in to do the job. Welles starred as Long John Silver and it was shot in Spain with a Spanish crew. Kim Burnfield, who played Jim Hawkins, came from England. Welles said \"A lot of people wanted me to do Treasure Island in Greece. But the colonels have locked up a lot of my friends so naturally I never considered going there. Besides, Spain is my home and this is the place I would rather work.\" National General agreed to provide some finance and distribute in the US.

Euripides' play Helen, written in the late 5th century BC, is the earliest source to report the most familiar account of Helen's birth: that, although her putative father was Tyndareus, she was actually Zeus' daughter. In the form of a swan, the king of gods was chased by an eagle, and sought refuge with Leda. The swan gained her affection, and the two mated. Leda then produced an egg, from which Helen emerged. The First Vatican Mythographer introduces the notion that two eggs came from the union: one containing Castor and Pollux; one with Helen and Clytemnestra. Nevertheless, the same author earlier states that Helen, Castor and Pollux were produced from a single egg. Fabius Planciades Fulgentius also states that Helen, Castor and Pollux are born from the same egg.  Pseudo-Apollodorus states that Leda had intercourse with both Zeus and Tyndareus the night she conceived Helen. On the other hand, in the Cypria, part of the Epic Cycle, Helen was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Nemesis. The date of the Cypria is uncertain, but it is generally thought to preserve traditions that date back to at least the 7th century\u00a0BC. In the Cypria, Nemesis did not wish to mate with Zeus. She therefore changed shape into various animals as she attempted to flee Zeus, finally becoming a goose. Zeus also transformed himself into a goose and raped Nemesis, who produced an egg from which Helen was born. Presumably, in the Cypria, this egg was somehow transferred to Leda. Later sources state either that it was brought to Leda by a shepherd who discovered it in a grove in Attica, or that it was dropped into her lap by Hermes. Asclepiades of Tragilos and Pseudo-Eratosthenes related a similar story, except that Zeus and Nemesis became swans instead of geese. Timothy Gantz has suggested that the tradition that Zeus came to Leda in the form of a swan derives from the version in which Zeus and Nemesis transformed into birds. Pausanias states that in the middle of the 2nd century\u00a0AD, the remains of an egg-shell, tied up in ribbons, were still suspended from the roof of a temple on the Spartan acropolis. People believed that this was \"the famous egg that legend says Leda brought forth\". Pausanias traveled to Sparta to visit the sanctuary, dedicated to Hilaeira and Phoebe, in order to see the relic for himself. Pausanias also says that there was a local tradition that Helen's brothers, \"the Dioscuri\" , were born on the island of Pefnos, adding that the Spartan poet Alcman also said this, while the poet Lycophron's use of the adjective \"Pephnaian\" in association with Helen, suggests that Lycophron may have known a tradition which held that Helen was also born on the island.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_547", "question": "Who was the producer of Awakening?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_1289", "text": "The Nikaya-texts narrate that the ascetic Gautama practised under two teachers of yogic meditation. According to MN 26 and its Chinese parallel at M\u0100 204, after having mastered the teaching of \u0100r\u0101\u1e0da K\u0101l\u0101ma , who taught a meditation attainment called \"the sphere of nothingness\", he was asked by \u0100r\u0101\u1e0da to become an equal leader of their spiritual community. However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practice because it \"does not lead to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to knowledge, to awakening, to Nibbana\", and moved on to become a student of Udraka R\u0101maputra . With him, he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness and was again asked to join his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied for the same reasons as before, and moved on. Majjhima Nikaya 4 also mentions that Gautama lived in \"remote jungle thickets\" during his years of spiritual striving and had to overcome the fear that he felt while living in the forests. After leaving his meditation teachers, Gotama then practiced ascetic techniques. An account of these practices can be seen in the Mah\u0101saccaka-sutta and its various parallels . The ascetic techniques described in the early texts include very minimal food intake, different forms of breath control, and forceful mind control. The texts report that he became so emaciated that his bones became visible through his skin. According to other early Buddhist texts, after realising that meditative dhyana was the right path to awakening, Gautama discovered \"the Middle Way\"\u2014a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification, or the Noble Eightfold Path. His break with asceticism is said to have led his five companions to abandon him, since they believed that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined. One popular story tells of how he accepted milk and rice pudding from a village girl named Sujata. Following his decision to stop extreme ascetic practices, M\u0100 204 and other parallel early texts report that Gautama sat down to meditate with the determination not to get up until full awakening had been reached. This event was said to have occurred under a pipal tree\u2014known as \"the Bodhi tree\"\u2014in Bodh Gaya, Bihar. Likewise, the Mah\u0101saccaka-sutta and most of its parallels agree that after taking asceticism to its extremes, the Buddha realized that this had not helped him reach awakening. At this point, he remembered a previous meditative experience he had as a child sitting under a tree while his father worked. This memory leads him to understand that dhyana is the path to awakening, and the texts then depict the Buddha achieving all four dhyanas, followed by the \"three higher knowledges\" culminating in awakening. Gautama thus became known as the Buddha or \"Awakened One\". The title indicates that unlike most people who are \"asleep\", a Buddha is understood as having \"woken up\" to the true nature of reality and sees the world 'as it is' . A Buddha has achieved liberation , also called Nirvana, which is seen as the extinguishing of the \"fires\" of desire, hatred, and ignorance, that keep the cycle of suffering and rebirth going. According to various early texts like the Mah\u0101saccaka-sutta, and the Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta, a Buddha has achieved three higher knowledges: Remembering one's former abodes , the \"Divine eye\" , which allows the knowing of others' karmic destinations and the \"extinction of mental intoxicants\" . According to some texts from the Pali canon, at the time of his awakening he realised complete insight into the Four Noble Truths, thereby attaining liberation from samsara, the endless cycle of rebirth. As reported by various texts from the Pali Canon, the Buddha sat for seven days under the bodhi tree \"feeling the bliss of deliverance.\" The Pali texts also report that he continued to meditate and contemplated various aspects of the Dharma while living by the River Naira\u00f1jan\u0101, such as Dependent Origination, the Five Spiritual Faculties and Suffering. The legendary biographies like the Mahavastu, Nidanakatha and the Lalitavistara depict an attempt by Mara, the ruler of the desire realm, to prevent the Buddha's nirvana. He does so by sending his daughters to seduce the Buddha, by asserting his superiority and by assaulting him with armies of monsters. However the Buddha is unfazed and calls on the earth as witness to his superiority by touching the ground before entering meditation. Other miracles and magical events are also depicted.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Leslie is the classic hero \u2013 always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful. Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain \u2013 usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at most everyone, possessing a maniacal evil laugh, filled with grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure. Leslie proposes an automobile race from New York City to Paris and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey.  They design and build a new car named \"The Leslie Special\". Fate builds his own race vehicle, \"The Hannibal Twin-8\", complete with hidden devices of sabotage. Other car owners enter the race, including one owned by New York City's most prominent newspaper. Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois, a vocal suffragist. A seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen has sabotaged four other cars , leaving just three cars in the race. The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy, Maggie DuBois driving a Stanley Steamer by herself, and Fate and Max. The steamer car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special. Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Boracho. A local outlaw named \"Texas Jack\" becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay and a saloon brawl ensues. Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest. Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and \"wanted to go back to New York\". The two remaining cars reach the Bering Strait and park side by side in a blinding snowstorm. Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors. Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car. They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended Russian port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him. Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead. After driving across Asia, both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the spitting image of Professor Fate. Plotters under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe and General Kuhster kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie. Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others. Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom. Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe's henchmen and confront Von Stuppe.  Following a climactic sword fight with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it. Leslie and Max return the real Prince to the capital in time to defeat Kuhster's plan for a military coup. Fate, still masquerading as Prince Hapnick, takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake.  A pie fight ensues involving the racers, the Prince's men and the conspirators. The five racers, covered in pie filling, depart Carpania with King Friedrich's best wishes. As the racers leave Pottsdorf , it becomes a straight road race to Paris. Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have a spirited argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships. Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the Eiffel Tower to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race. Fate drives past to claim the winner's mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win. Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York. The return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team. Fate lets them start first, then attempts to destroy their car with a small cannon. The shot misses the Leslie Special, instead knocking down the Eiffel Tower.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Euripides' play Helen, written in the late 5th century BC, is the earliest source to report the most familiar account of Helen's birth: that, although her putative father was Tyndareus, she was actually Zeus' daughter. In the form of a swan, the king of gods was chased by an eagle, and sought refuge with Leda. The swan gained her affection, and the two mated. Leda then produced an egg, from which Helen emerged. The First Vatican Mythographer introduces the notion that two eggs came from the union: one containing Castor and Pollux; one with Helen and Clytemnestra. Nevertheless, the same author earlier states that Helen, Castor and Pollux were produced from a single egg. Fabius Planciades Fulgentius also states that Helen, Castor and Pollux are born from the same egg.  Pseudo-Apollodorus states that Leda had intercourse with both Zeus and Tyndareus the night she conceived Helen. On the other hand, in the Cypria, part of the Epic Cycle, Helen was the daughter of Zeus and the goddess Nemesis. The date of the Cypria is uncertain, but it is generally thought to preserve traditions that date back to at least the 7th century\u00a0BC. In the Cypria, Nemesis did not wish to mate with Zeus. She therefore changed shape into various animals as she attempted to flee Zeus, finally becoming a goose. Zeus also transformed himself into a goose and raped Nemesis, who produced an egg from which Helen was born. Presumably, in the Cypria, this egg was somehow transferred to Leda.

After ending the regular season with 49 wins, L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury. West spectacularly took over Baylor's leading role, as he scored 49\u00a0 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win. In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52\u00a0 points, nearly half of L.A.'s\u00a0 total, in the 118\u2013115 win. The Bullets took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48\u00a0 points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42\u00a0 points in a close 117\u2013115 win. West averaged 46.3\u00a0 points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record. However, in the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4\u20131. In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones kept West to the only 26\u00a0 points, and in Game 2, West scored 45\u00a0 points, but Boston still won 129\u2013123. In Game 3, West scored 49\u00a0points, and L.A. finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win. Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6\u00a0points per game. In the 1965\u201366 NBA season, West averaged a career-best 31.3\u00a0points, along with 7.1\u00a0rebounds and 6.1\u00a0assists per game.  He made an NBA record 840 free throws, and earned yet another pair of All-Star Team and All-NBA First Team nominations. Winning 45 games, the Lakers beat the St. Louis Hawks in a close seven-game series, and yet again met the Boston Celtics in the 1966 NBA Finals. West was assisted by Baylor, who was a self-estimated \"75 percent\" of his pre-injury self, The two long-standing rivals split the first six games, with West's usual scoring dominance countered by Celtics forward John Havlicek, whose size and speed created serious mismatch problems for the Lakers. In Game 7, West and Baylor shot a combined three of 18 in the first half, and the Lakers fell far behind; L.A. willed themselves back to a close 95\u201393 with four seconds left, but the Celtics ran the clock out and the Lakers were denied yet again. The 1966\u201367 NBA season saw West playing only 66 regular-season games due to injury; his averages fell slightly to 28.0\u00a0points, 5.9\u00a0rebounds and 6.8\u00a0assists per game. The Lakers had a disappointing season, winning only 36 games and getting swept by the San Francisco Warriors in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs. Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired, and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over; under his reign, the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967\u201368 NBA season in their first season in The Forum. The 52 wins were accumulated despite West playing only 51 regular season games due to injury and scoring 26.3\u00a0 points, the lowest average since his rookie year: after being a First-Teamer for six times en bloc, he only made the All-NBA Second Team. In the 1968 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls and the Warriors to set up yet another Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals; it was considered a match of size versus speed, as the Lakers had nobody to guard Celtics coach/center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket, but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor, West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich. In Game 1, West only hit seven of 24 shots, and the Lakers lost 107\u2013101, but L.A. evened out the series at two games each. But West, who had scored 38\u00a0 points in a Game 4 win, had sprained his ankle and did not play at full strength the rest of the series. In Game 5, an injured West scored 35\u00a0points, but Boston won by three\u00a0points. In Game 6, Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40\u00a0 points, and after yet another Finals loss to Boston, West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won: \"We gave them the first game, and we gave them the fifth.

In comparison, its production budget was reported to be $150 million, and the total spent on marketing was estimated at $100\u2013125 million. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $5.2 million on its opening day. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15.3 million, below the studio's $20 million projection, and finished third at the box office. Several factors have been attributed to the financial failure of Pan. Forbes blogger Scott Mendelson attributed this to the absence of notable movie stars. Despite the presence of Jackman, \"like any number of would-be big stars who are best known for a certain franchise, his opening weekend strength dips when he's not playing his trademark character.\" Outside of the X-Men films, his biggest openings are Van Helsing and the $27 million debuts of Real Steel and Les Mis\u00e9rables. Variety described the departure of the film in tone and writings that made earlier Peter Pan stories and films a success, from Jackman's role as Blackbeard to the inclusion of contemporary pop songs from Nirvana and the Ramones which is peculiar for a children's film adaptation. \"Without the Disney seal of approval, audiences are a bit wary of these fairy tale adaptations,\" said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. He added, \"It veered off the Peter Pan path quite extensively and it was just too far left of center for a generation that grew up with Hook and sees that as the definitive account.\" Warner Bros. declined to discuss Pans box office results. Pan also struggled internationally, grossing $20.4 million on its opening weekend from 54 markets from over 11,000 screens. 3D comprised 85% of the opening gross. The film was released in Australia on September 24, 2015, to take advantage of the prime September school holidays, where it grossed $1.5 million in its opening weekend.

The Hollywood Reporter estimated that the film cost $275 million to produce and market worldwide\u2014while The New York Times reported at least $250 million\u2014and noted that the financial losses by Warner Bros. could finish anywhere between $130 to $150 million. The site suggested that if the film overperformed in China\u2014the world's second largest movie market\u2014the losses could have been lower.

The city has been plagued by a series of brutal, ritualistic child murders. The first victim is a young boy found murdered in an abandoned movie theater. A policeman named Tom Lopez frantically phones in the discovery of the body, and claims the crimes are being committed by members of a Hispanic cult practicing a malevolent version of brujer\u00eda. Cal is appointed to examine Tom, who raves about the cult's powerful leader. A second victim is found eviscerated on a makeshift altar beneath a dock in Staten Island. Cal begins to inquire about brujer\u00eda to Carmen, his housekeeper and nanny, who practices a benevolent form of it, leaving protection charms in the apartment for Cal and Chris. The following day, Tom, paranoid and being followed by mysterious men, stabs himself to death in a diner. Later, Cal and his new girlfriend, Jessica, attend a party where a mysterious Caribbean man, Palo, attempts to steal a necklace from Jessica; shortly before, Jessica had left her compact in the bathroom, and unbeknownst to Jessica, Palo rubs the pad with his fingers. When Cal returns home, he finds Carmen performing a ritual on Chris, and angrily throws her out of the house, despite the fact that she assures him she is attempting to protect him. Chris accompanies his affluent Aunt Kate and Uncle Dennis on a trip to stay at their country home. Meanwhile, Cal and Jessica consult Oscar Sezine, a friend of Tom's, who believes the cult is planning a ritualized murder for the summer solstice in four days time. Oscar performs a purification ritual in an attempt to ensure the safety of Chris, whom he worries may be targeted as a sacrifice for the solstice. The next morning, Jessica finds a boil on her face and falls ill. Before departing to reunite with Kate, Dennis, and Chris in the country, Cal receives a frantic phone call from police lieutenant Sean McTaggert. Cal arrives at McTaggert's apartment, finding it in disarray, and McTaggert seated with a gun, rambling in a paranoid manner. He shows Cal a photo and secret file he uncovered documenting elite businessman Robert Calder's ritual murder of his own son. Cal leaves with the file at McTaggert's insistence. After he leaves, McTaggert commits suicide. Meanwhile, Jessica has a panic attack after the boil on her face bursts baby spiders break free from the wound. While Cal tends to Jessica in the hospital, Kate leaves him a voice message that she has changed her plans and is going to return Chris to him, but the message is cut short. Unaware Kate has called, Cal departs the hospital with his friend Marty, who drives him to Kate and Dennis's country house. Upon arriving, Dennis tells Cal that Kate has gone to a 24-hour grocery store. In the living room, Dennis recounts he and Kate's travels to the Sudan when Kate was a graduate student, and how they witnessed the power of a human sacrifice after allowing their gravely ill son to be sacrificed to end a drought. Palo and Calder then enter the room, along with a number of other cultists, urging Cal to join, and stating that Chris has been predestined to become a sacrifice. Cal flees the house through an upstairs window after finding Chris no longer in his room. In the boathouse, Cal finds Kate's dead body before he is knocked unconscious by Palo. Cal is driven to an abandoned factory, where Chris's ritual murder is to be carried out among the cult. Cal thwarts the sacrifice by stabbing Dennis to death, and Marty, who followed them to the warehouse, comes to Cal's aid, shooting various cultists  from an upper landing. Calder abducts Chris and the two ascend to the top of the warehouse in a freight elevator. Marty is incapacitated with a blowpipe dart by Palo, but not before he severely burns Palo's face, blinding him.

It continues into \"St. Alfonzo's Pancake Breakfast,\" which Zappa said was inspired by a television commercial for Imperial margarine. As was the case with many of Zappa's albums, Apostrophe was a melange of archival and recent recordings; side one of Apostrophe and Over-Nite Sensation were recorded simultaneously. The tracks on side two originate from various 1972 sessions with overdubs recorded in 1973 and 1974, except for \"Excentrifugal Forz\", where the drum track originally came from the Hot Rats sessions in 1969 and L\u00e4ther , although in the case of \"Excentrifugal Forz\" this is not actually noted in either the album liner notes or official correspondence), and \"Stinkfoot\", where the basic track, possibly originally known as \"The Bass & Drums Song\", dates from the Chunga's Revenge sessions in early 1970. \"Apostrophe \" is an instrumental featuring bassist Jack Bruce and session drummer Jim Gordon, who was on tour with Zappa's band at the time of the session in November 1972. Bruce is credited on the album cover with bass guitar and co-writing the title song.

Latin literature was, and still is, highly influential in the world, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid and Livy. The Romans were also famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama and epigrams. In early years of the 13th century, St. Francis of Assisi was considered the first Italian poet by literary critics, with his religious song Canticle of the Sun. Another Italian voice originated in Sicily. At the court of Emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Proven\u00e7al forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. One of these poets was the notary Giacomo da Lentini, inventor of the sonnet form, though the most famous early sonneteer was Petrarch. Guido Guinizelli is considered the founder of the Dolce Stil Novo, a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced Guido Cavalcanti and the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, who established the basis of the modern Italian language; his greatest work, the Divine Comedy, is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the Middle Ages; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult terza rima. Two major writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio, sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, Il Canzoniere. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's The Decameron, one of the most popular collections of short stories ever written. Italian Renaissance authors produced works including Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's The Prince, an essay on political science and modern philosophy in which the \"effectual truth\" is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal; Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando Innamorato; and Baldassare Castiglione's dialogue The Book of the Courtier which describes the ideal of the perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty. The lyric poet Torquato Tasso in Jerusalem Delivered wrote a Christian epic in ottava rima, with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity. Giovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile, which have written The Facetious Nights of Straparola and the Pentamerone respectively, printed some of the first known versions of fairy tales in Europe. In the early 17th century, some literary masterpieces were created, such as Giambattista Marino's long mythological poem, L'Adone. The Baroque period also produced the clear scientific prose of Galileo as well as Tommaso Campanella's The City of the Sun, a description of a perfect society ruled by a philosopher-priest. At the end of the 17th century, the Arcadians began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry, as in Metastasio's heroic melodramas. In the 18th century, playwright Carlo Goldoni created full written plays, many portraying the middle class of his day. The Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the Risorgimento, the patriotic movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, and Giacomo Leopardi. The works by Alessandro Manzoni, the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of the Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language; his novel The Betrothed was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence, and it has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language. In the late 19th century, a realistic literary movement called Verismo played a major role in Italian literature; Giovanni Verga and Luigi Capuana were its main exponents. In the same period, Emilio Salgari, writer of action-adventure swashbucklers and a pioneer of science fiction, published his Sandokan series. In 1883, Carlo Collodi also published the novel The Adventures of Pinocchio, the most celebrated children's classic by an Italian author and one the most translated non-religious books in the world. A movement called Futurism influenced Italian literature in the early 20th century. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti wrote Manifesto of Futurism, called for the use of language and metaphors that glorified the speed, dynamism, and violence of the machine age. Modern literary figures and Nobel laureates are Gabriele D'Annunzio from 1889 to 1910, nationalist poet Giosu\u00e8 Carducci in 1906, realist writer Grazia Deledda in 1926, modern theatre author Luigi Pirandello in 1936, short stories writer Italo Calvino in 1960, poets Salvatore Quasimodo in 1959 and Eugenio Montale in 1975, Umberto Eco in 1980, and satirist and theatre author Dario Fo in 1997.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eisner declined but recommended Harlan Ellison, who wrote a two-hour live-action script for the filmmaker. Friedkin and Ellison afterward had an unrelated argument, and the project was abandoned. During the 1980s, Brad Bird, Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz attempted to get an animated adaptation off the ground, though studio executives praised the screenplay, they thought the film would be unmarketable, and this version was scrapped. In the early 1990s, producer Michael Uslan and executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Steven Maier subsequently obtained the rights for a live-action film adaptation. The producer promised Eisner that he would not permit anyone who \"didn't get it\" to work on the project. Two ideas pitched to Uslan were to put the Spirit in a costume and to have the Spirit be a resurrected dead man who possessed supernatural powers. Screenwriter John Turman, a comic book fan, expressed interest in writing the script. In July 2004, financier OddLot Entertainment acquired the rights to the film. OddLot's producers Gigi Pritzker and Deborah Del Prete began a collaboration with Uslan, Melniker, and Maier working at Batfilm Productions, to adapt the story. Eisner, who was protective of the rights to his creations, said that he believed in the producers to faithfully adapt The Spirit. In April 2005, comic-book writer Jeph Loeb was hired to adapt The Spirit for the big screen, but the writer eventually left the project. Later in April, Uslan approached Frank Miller at Will Eisner's memorial service in New York City several weeks after Miller's Sin City was released in theaters, interested in initiating the adaptation technique with Miller's film for The Spirit.  Miller had initially hesitated, doubting his skill in adapting The Spirit, but ultimately embraced his first solo project as writer-director. Miller described his decision-making: In July 2006, the film trade press reported Miller would write and direct the film adaptation for The Spirit\u2009; Miller and the producers publicly announced this at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Miller said that he was putting together a film treatment that included large parts of The Spirit strip panels. As Miller described the project, \"I intend to be extremely faithful to the heart and soul of the material, but it won't be nostalgic. It will be much scarier than people expect\". Miller filmed The Spirit using the same digital background technology that was used for Sin City and 300. The film would also copy specific shots from the comic, similar to Sin City. In February 2007, Miller completed the first draft of the screenplay and began work on a second draft.  Principal photography was initially slated to begin in late spring 2007.  Miller also planned to begin filming Sin City 2 in spring 2009, and Uslan indicated that filming for The Spirit would begin before Miller started Sin City 2.

The two met in 1964 when they performed together in the Off-Broadway flop Hang Down Your Head and Die, and they began writing Hair together in late 1964.  The main characters were autobiographical, with Rado's Claude being a pensive romantic and Ragni's Berger an extrovert.  Their close relationship, including its volatility, was reflected in the musical.  Rado explained, \"We were great friends.  It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece.  We put the drama between us on stage.\" Rado described the inspiration for Hair as \"a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations.  We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked out of school for growing their hair long\".  He recalled, \"There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.\u00a0... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [and] let our hair grow.\" Many cast members were recruited right off the street.  Rado said, \"It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples.  You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it.  We thought, 'This is happening in the streets', and we wanted to bring it to the stage.\" Rado and Ragni came from different artistic backgrounds. In college, Rado wrote musical revues and aspired to be a Broadway composer in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition.  He went on to study acting with Lee Strasberg.  Ragni, on the other hand, was an active member of The Open Theater, one of several groups, mostly Off-off Broadway, that were developing experimental theatre techniques.  He introduced Rado to the modern theatre styles and methods being developed at The Open Theater.  In 1966, while the two were developing Hair, Ragni performed in The Open Theater's production of Megan Terry's play, Viet Rock, a story about young men being deployed to the Vietnam War. In addition to the war theme, Viet Rock employed the improvisational exercises being used in the experimental theatre scene and later used in the development of Hair. Rado and Ragni brought their drafts of the show to producer Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition \"African Waltz\" .  The composer's lifestyle was in marked contrast to his co-creators: \"I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island.\"  \"I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni.\"  But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show.  \"We work independently\", explained MacDermot in May 1968.  \"I prefer it that way.  They hand me the material.  I set it to music.\"  MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs \"I Got Life\", \"Ain't Got No\", \"Where Do I Go\" and the title song.  He first wrote \"Aquarius\" as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Artifact was initially on one of the alien ships flying over Earth on July 2, 1947, but the ship collided with a spy balloon and crashed, and most of its crew died. The Artifact itself was thrown clear of the ship and left half-buried in the ground. It was found and retrieved by Sue, a local woman who was the estranged girlfriend of ambitious Air Force Captain Owen Crawford. Sue, seeing the small scrap of metal had alien writing on it and hoping it would rekindle her relationship with Owen, takes it to him. Owen, who is being phased out of the investigation into the crashed alien spaceship , brutally murders Sue. Owen then shows the Artifact to his superior, Colonel Thomas Campbell, and blackmails him into promoting him to Major and making him head of the Roswell UFO Investigation Project. Over the next 50 years, the Artifact remains in the possession of the Crawford family, and acts as the guide to each member's efforts to understand the aliens' mission on Earth. The Artifact's true nature isn't revealed until 2002, when the head of the Project, Mary Crawford, discovers new writing is still being formed on the Artifact's surface. This reveals to the government that the Artifact is the recording device of the aliens' great genetic experiment: to create a hybrid being possessing the aliens' powers and more-evolved consciousness as well as humankind's emotional core, which will lead them to the next step in their evolution. It has been continuously recording the events of the aliens' experiments over the decades since its arrival on Earth.

In chronological order: Wilee is a disenchanted Columbia Law School graduate who has put off taking the bar exam because he could not bear to enter the humdrum life of the legal profession. He finds meaning and purpose in being employed as a thrill-seeking New York City bicycle messenger, despite arguments with his girlfriend and fellow bike messenger, Vanessa, who insists that he should make something of himself. Vanessa's roommate, Nima, has asked Vanessa to move out for a personal reason she does not disclose. Vanessa is in the process of packing her few belongings. Nima delivers $50,000 that she has saved for two years to Mr. Leung, a Chinese hawaladar, in exchange for a ticket that she must deliver to Sister Chen, so that Chen\u2019s gang can smuggle Nima's son and mother from China to the United States. Mr. Lin, a local loan shark, has learned of the ticket and that whoever returns it to Mr. Leung can collect Nima's money. He approaches Robert \"Bobby\" Monday, a gambling-addicted NYPD detective who owes him money, offering to clear Monday's debt if Monday gets him the ticket. Monday begins searching for Nima, who decides to hire Wilee to deliver the envelope with the ticket to Sister Chen by 7 pm after Nima is told by Leung that anyone who knew she was visiting him is a loose end which could endanger her if she tries to deliver the ticket herself. Wilee and Nima conduct their transaction at the college attended by Nima. After Wilee leaves, Nima is confronted by Monday, who sees the courier receipt Wilee gave her. He is able to steal the receipt from Nima. After Monday leaves, Vanessa finds Nima, and learns the contents of the envelope. Monday catches up with Wilee before he leaves the college campus, stating that he is a school official, that Nima had no authority to handle the contents of the envelope on the school's behalf, and that he would like the envelope back, with the receipt Wilee gave to Nima in his hands. Wilee refuses. He is able to escape, with Monday in pursuit. Wilee heads to the police station to report Monday, only to find out he's a police detective. Wilee hides in a bathroom, where he opens the envelope and finds the ticket. After he escapes the station, Wilee angrily tells his dispatcher, Raj, that he is returning the package so that someone else can drop it off. Returning to Nima's college, Wilee leaves the envelope, which is picked up by his rival, Manny. Before Manny picks it up, however, Monday calls the dispatch to redirect the delivery to a different address. As he is about to leave the school after returning the envelope, Wilee runs into Nima. He confronts her about the ticket, and she reveals the truth. Guilt-ridden, Wilee tries to catch up to Manny, who refuses to give Wilee his drop. They race each other and in the process, are chased by a bike cop who had earlier tried to arrest Wilee. As they approach Monday's location, the bike cop tackles Manny off his bike and arrests him. Vanessa, who learns of Monday's trickery and races over to warn Manny, appears, grabs Manny's bag and gives it to Wilee. As they are about to escape, Wilee is hit by a taxi, and fractures some ribs. He is put in an ambulance with Monday, while his damaged bike is taken to an impound lot, with the envelope hidden in the handlebars. Monday tortures Wilee by pressing on his injured ribs, and Wilee offers to give Monday the envelope in exchange for his bike. Wilee tells Monday that the envelope is in Manny's bag, and Monday leaves to search it, while Wilee meets with Vanessa in the impound lot. She gives him the envelope, which she had retrieved, and he escapes on a stolen bike. Monday, realizing Wilee has tricked him, pursues Wilee to Sister Chen's place. Meanwhile, Nima calls Mr. Leung for help. He deploys his enforcer, the Sudoku Man, to help her. As Wilee reaches Chinatown, he is confronted by Monday, who is threatening to kill him. However, Vanessa arrives with a flash mob of messengers, dispatched by Raj, who delay Monday by hitting him numerous times, giving Wilee time to deliver the ticket to Sister Chen just before the stroke of 7 pm. She calls the captain of her ship and tells him to allow Nima's family aboard. Outside, Monday is confronted by Chinese and Italian mobsters and doesn't notice Sudoku Man, who shoots Monday in the back of his head with a silenced pistol. Dying and feeling faint, Monday tries to get in his car but dies before he can do so. Nima's mother calls her and confirms that she and Nima's son have gotten on the ship. Nima meets with Wilee and Vanessa while they are finally reunited. Some time later, Wilee is back on his job stating while one day he might settle in a firm job but doesn't feel ready.

Although Levinson chose to abandon the documentary upon learning that Frontline already covered the same issue, Levinson instead decided to use the research to produce a horror film which he hoped would shed light on the issues facing Chesapeake. As such when promoting the film he noted that it's \"80 percent factual information.\" According to script writer Michael Wallach, the script originally started out as a short story about a young couple who comes across a dead town. After having pieced together what happened from footage scattered across town, they realize the town had not fully died yet. Barry was happy with the script, and sent Wallach the movie JFK: 3 Shots That Changed America and asked if the movie could be made into a documentary. Levinson chose to use the found footage format after thinking about the Pompeii disaster and noting that if such a disaster happened today there would be much more evidence of what happened with him telling Yahoo! \"For the very first time in history, you can get a picture of that town, if you collect all the footage from everyone's cell phones and their digital cameras and the Skypes, and the texting and everything else\" A byproduct of the format was that much of the footage was able to be shot by the actors themselves as opposed to a more traditional camera crew. According to Levinson roughly one third of the film was shot this way.

Following Adele's graduation from the BRIT School in April 2006, she began publishing songs and recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend, who posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to interest from the record label. This led to Adele signing a recording contract at age 17 with the label and providing vocals for Jack Pe\u00f1ate. During this session for Pe\u00f1ate's song she met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album. Named after the age of the singer during its release and production, Adele wrote most of the album's material solely, but did work with a select few writers and producers including Jim Abbiss, Eg White and Sacha Skarbek. Their collaborations created a blue-eyed soul album with folk rock, indie pop, and jazz influences and lyrics describing heartbreak, nostalgia and relationships. Upon release, 19 received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Adele's vocal prowess and songwriting talent at such a young age and noted her as having the \"potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" 19 also won numerous accolades including the Mercury Prize and the European Border Breakers Award. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, Adele won Best New Artist alongside Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Chasing Pavements\".

Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project.  Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it.  But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\" Part of the legacy of The Dark Side of the Moon is its influence on modern music and on the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs; moreover, the record gave rise to the \"Dark Side of the Rainbow\" theory, according to which the album matches up perfectly with the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz when they are played simultaneously. The album's release is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes made with Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, including a premise explored by Ben Schleifer in Speak to Me': The Legacy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon that the two albums share a theme that \"the creative individual loses the ability to function in the [modern] world\". In a 2018 book about classic rock, Steven Hyden recalls concluding, in his teens, that The Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV were the two greatest albums of the genre, vision quests \"encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire\". They had similarities, in that both album's cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favor of \"inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning \". But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward \"conquering the world\" and was known at the time for its outrageous sexual antics while on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward \"overcoming your own hang-ups\" and seemed so sedate and boring that, Hyden commented, the scene in Live at Pompeii where they take a lunch break at the studio might well have been the most interesting part of recording The Dark Side of the Moon. In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

The script turned in by renowned science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon had emphasized the importance of fantasy as a component of relaxation, and the network was concerned that the script might be too surreal. Roddenberry assured the network that the script would be rewritten and the fantasy would be de-emphasized before he went on vacation. However, this was not made clear to incoming operational producer Gene L. Coon, who did the rewrite and emphasized the fantasy aspect even more. Roddenberry returned the day before shooting was due to begin and realized that he had a problem. Sturgeon particularly objected to McCoy's bringing back two women to the ship, believing it undermined the emotional tension between McCoy and Tonia. The location shooting that makes up 90% of the episode took place at Africa USA, an animal training preserve where the television series Cowboy in Africa and Daktari often filmed. Star Trek lore says that Roddenberry set up a table, a chair, and a typewriter under a tree, frantically rewriting Coon's revised script, trying to stay ahead of the shooting schedule while maintaining some sort of continuity. This caused a few problems. Even with Roddenberry's rewriting, many of Coon's and Sturgeon's fantasy aspects remained, from an encounter with a samurai, to meeting a tiger , and a scene using an elephant was cut before filming.

It is considered one of the most antisemitic films of all time. The film was directed by Veit Harlan, who wrote the screenplay with Eberhard Wolfgang M\u00f6ller and Ludwig Metzger. The leading roles were played by Ferdinand Marian and Harlan's wife Kristina S\u00f6derbaum; Werner Krauss and Heinrich George played key supporting roles. The film has been characterized as \"one of the most notorious and successful pieces of antisemitic film propaganda produced in Nazi Germany.\" It was a great success in Germany, and was seen by 20 million people. Although its budget of 2 million Reichsmarks was considered high for films of that era, the box office receipts of 6.5 million Reichsmarks made it a financial success. Heinrich Himmler urged members of the SS and police to see it. After the war, some of the leading cast members were brought to trial as part of the denazification process. They generally defended their participation in the film on the grounds that they had only done so under duress. Despite significant evidence to support their arguments, Susan Tegel, author of Nazis and the Cinema, characterizes their postwar attempts to distance themselves from the film as \"crass and self-serving\"; she argues that their motives for accepting the roles seem to have been more driven by opportunistic ambition than by antisemitism. Harlan was the only major movie director of the Third Reich to stand trial for crimes against humanity. After three trials, he was given a light sentence because he convinced the courts that the antisemitic content of the film had been dictated by Goebbels and that Harlan had worked to moderate the antisemitism. Eventually, Harlan was reinstated as a citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany and made nine more films. He remained a controversial figure and the target of protests. Together with Die Rothschilds and Der ewige Jude, both released in 1940, the film remains one of the most frequently discussed examples of the use of film to further the Nazi antisemitic agenda.

Quintanilla, Jr. took P\u00e9rez off the bus and told him his relationship with Selena was over. Selena and P\u00e9rez continued their relationship despite Quintanilla, Jr's disapproval; Selena's mother Marcella approved of their relationship. Quintanilla, Jr. saw Selena and P\u00e9rez romantically together on the bus after he informed them of his disapproval; he pulled over and an argument between Quintanilla, Jr. and Selena ensued. He called P\u00e9rez a \"cancer in my family\" and threatened to disband the group if they continued their relationship. Selena and P\u00e9rez relented; Quintanilla, Jr. fired P\u00e9rez from the band and prevented Selena from leaving with him. After his dismissal, P\u00e9rez and Selena secretly continued their relationship. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena and P\u00e9rez decided to elope, believing Quintanilla, Jr. would never approve of their relationship. Selena thought Quintanilla, Jr. would have to accept them if they were married, and would not have to hide their feelings for each other. Within hours of their marriage, the media announced the couple's elopement. Selena's family tried to find her; Quintanilla, Jr. did not take the news well and alienated himself for some time. Selena and P\u00e9rez moved into an apartment in Corpus Christi. In interviews, Quintanilla, Jr. expressed how he feared P\u00e9rez could be a machista , who would force Selena to end her career and music goals, a move that prevented Quintanilla, Jr. to accept P\u00e9rez as being suitable for Selena at the time. Quintanilla, Jr. later approached P\u00e9rez, apologized, accepted the marriage, and took P\u00e9rez back into the band. A month after her elopement, Selena released her third studio album, Entre a Mi Mundo, in May 1992. The album was critically acclaimed as her \"breakthrough album\". The recording peaked at number one on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months; it was certified 10x platinum by the RIAA for sales of 600,000 album-equivalent units, while in Mexico, the album sold 385,000 units. Entre a Mi Mundo became the first Tejano album by a female artist to sell over 300,000 copies. Selena was booked for a high-profile border press tour in Monterrey, Mexico, with music media types in a meet-and-greet conference. At the time, Tejanos were looked down on as \"hayseed pochos\" among Mexican citizens. The singer's Spanish was far from fluent; EMI Latin executives were \"terrified\" about the singer's limited Spanish during the press conference for the album in Mexico. According to Patoski, Selena \"played her cards right\" during the conference and won over the Mexican media after newspapers hailed her as \"an artist of the people\". The newspapers found her to be a refreshing change from Mexican telenovela actors \"who were fair-skinned, blond-haired, and green-eyed.\" After her publicity press, Selena was booked to play at several concerts throughout Mexico, including a performance at Festival Acapulco in May 1993, which garnered her critical acclaim. Her performance in Nuevo Leon on September 17, 1993, was attended by 70,000 people, garnering her the title of the biggest Tejano act in Mexico. The album produced four singles; \"Como la Flor\", \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 Cre\u00edas?\", \"La Carcacha\", and \"Amame\". \"Como la Flor\" became Selena's signature recording; it was critically acclaimed by music critics as a career launcher for Selena. \"Como la Flor\" helped Selena to dominate the Latin music charts and become immensely popular in Mexico\u00a0\u2014 where Mexican-Americans were generally not liked among citizens\u00a0\u2014 which was well received by critics. The track was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards. The single peaked at number six on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart. In 1994, Entre a Mi Mundo ranked as the second best-selling regional Mexican album of all-time. Selena released Live! a year after Entre a Mi Mundo; it was recorded during a free concert at the Memorial Coliseum in Corpus Christi, on February 7, 1993. The album included previously released tracks that were sung live and three studio recordings; \"No Debes Jugar\", \"La Llamada\", and \"T\u00fa Robaste Mi Coraz\u00f3n\"\u00a0\u2014 a duet with Tejano musician Emilio Navaira. The tracks \"No Debes Jugar\" and \"La Llamada\" peaked within the top five on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart.

{"id": "164_596", "question": "Who was the producer of The Chorus?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_22298", "text": "During the parabasis proper , the Chorus reveals that the original play was badly received when it was produced.  References in the same parabasis to a play by Eupolis called Maricas produced in 421 BC and criticism of the populist politician Hyperbolus who was ostracized in 416 indicate that the second version of The Clouds was probably composed somewhere between 421\u201316 BC. The parabasis also includes an appeal to the audience to prosecute Cleon for corruption. Since Cleon died in 422 it can be assumed that this appeal was retained from the original production in 423 and thus the extant play must be a partial revision of the original play. The revised play is an incomplete form of Old Comedy. Old Comedy conventionally limits the number of actors to three or four, yet there are already three actors on stage when Superior and Inferior enter the action and there is no song at that point that would allow for a change of costume. The play is unusually serious for an Old Comedy and possibly this was the reason why the original play failed at the City Dionysia. As a result of this seriousness, there is no celebratory song in the exodus, and this also is an uncharacteristic omission.  A typical Aristophanic Chorus, even if it starts out as hostile to the protagonist, is the protagonist's cheer squad by the end of the play.  In The Clouds however, the Chorus appears sympathetic at first but emerges as a virtual antagonist by the end of the play. The play adapts the following elements of Old Comedy in a variety of novel ways. Parodos:  The arrival of the Chorus in this play is unusual in that the singing begins offstage some time before the Chorus appears.  It is possible that the concealed Chorus was not fully audible to the audience and this might have been a factor in the original play's failure. Moreover, the majestic opening song is more typical of tragedy than comedy. Parabasis: The parabasis proper is composed in eupolidean tetrameter rather than the conventional anapestic tetrameter.  Aristophanes does not use eupolideans in any other of his extant plays.  The first parabasis is otherwise conventional. However the second parabasis is in a shortened form, comprising an epirrhema in trochaic tetrameter but without the songs and the antepirrhema needed for a conventional, symmetrical scene. Agon:  The play has two agons.  The first is between Superior and Inferior .  Superior's arguments are in conventional anapestic tetrameter but Inferior presents his case in iambic tetrameters, a variation that Aristophanes reserves for arguments that are not to be taken seriously. A similar distinction between anapestic and iambic arguments is made in the agons in The Knights and The Frogs. The second agon in The Clouds is between Strepsiades and his son and it is in iambic tetrameter for both speakers. Episodes:  Informal dialogue between characters is conventionally in iambic trimeter.  However the scene introducing Superior and Inferior is conducted in short lines of anapestic rhythm .  Later, in the agon between Strepsiades and his son, a line of dialogue in iambic trimeter \u2013 adapted from Euripides' Alcestis \u2013 is inserted into a speech in iambic tetrameter, a transition that seems uncharacteristically clumsy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The vast majority live in the south-west corner; 79 percent of the population lives in the Perth area, leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated. The first Europeans to visit Western Australia belonged to the Dutch Dirk Hartog expedition, who visited the Western Australian coast in 1616. The first permanent European settlement of Western Australia occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December 1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial government. Lockyer established a convict-supported military garrison at King George III Sound, at present-day Albany, and on 21 January 1827. He formally took possession for the British Crown of the western part of the continent that was not already claimed by the British Crown. This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829, including the site of the present-day capital, Perth. York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia. Situated  east of Perth, it was settled on 16 September 1831. Western Australia achieved responsible government in 1890 and federated with the other British colonies in Australia in 1901.

Special effects expert Tom Savini, who had previously worked on Two Evil Eyes, was recruited to produce the films extensive gore and prosthetic effects. Savini also created the film's central murder weapon, dubbed the \"Noose-o-Matic\" by the crew. Savini devised a number of elaborate effects, but they were scrapped when Argento decided to minimize his trademark gore; according to Savini, \"Edge-of-the-seat suspense is what he was after\". Savini was also set to appear in a scrapped pre-credits sequence where his character was to be decapitated in an accident, an event that would trigger the killer's psychosis.

Castelli was a writer/producer who traveled in Paris art circles and rubbed elbows with Pablo Picasso and Jean Cocteau.  Butler described him as a \"crazy showman ... the guy with the business suit and beads\".  Castelli decided to do the show in the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English.  The translations followed the original script closely, and the Broadway stagings were used.  Each script contained local references, such as street names and the names or depictions of local politicians and celebrities.  Castelli produced companies in France, Germany, Mexico and other countries, sometimes also directing the productions. The first European production opened in Stockholm, Sweden, on September 20, 1968, with a cast including Ulf Brunnberg and Bill \u00d6hrstr\u00f6m, produced and directed by Pierre Fr\u00e4nckel and choreographed by Julie Arenal, and ran for 134 performances until March 1969. A German production, directed by Castelli, opened a month later in Munich; the tribe included Donna Summer, Liz Mitchell and Donna Wyant.  A successful Parisian production of Hair opened on June 1, 1969.  The original Australian production premiered in Sydney on June 6, 1969, produced by Harry M. Miller and directed by Jim Sharman, who also designed the production.  The tribe included Keith Glass and then Reg Livermore as Berger, John Waters as Claude and Sharon Redd as The Magician. Redd was one of six African-Americans brought to Australia to provide a racially integrated tribe. The production broke local box-office records and ran for two years, but because of some of the language in the show, the cast album was banned in Queensland and New Zealand.  The production transferred to Melbourne in 1971 and then had a national tour.  It marked the stage debut of Boston-born Australian vocalist Marcia Hines.  In Mexico the production was banned by the government after one night in Acapulco. An 18-year-old S\u00f4nia Braga appeared in the 1969 Brazilian production. Another notable production was in Belgrade, in the former Yugoslavia, in 1969. It was the first Hair to be produced in a communist country. The show, translated into Serbian, was directed by female producer-director Mira Trailovi\u0107 at the Atelje 212 theatre. It featured Dragan Nikoli\u0107, Branko Mili\u0107evi\u0107, Seka Sabli\u0107 and Du\u0161an Prelevi\u0107. Over four years, the production received 250 performances and was attended by president Tito. Local references in the script included barbs aimed at Mao Zedong as well as Albania, Yugoslavia's traditional rival. By 1970, Hair was a huge financial success, and nineteen productions had been staged outside of North America.  In addition to those named above, these included productions in Scandinavia, South America, Italy, Israel, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria.  According to Billboard, the various productions of the show were raking in almost $1\u00a0million every ten days, and royalties were being collected for 300 different recordings of the show's songs, making it \"the most successful score in history as well as the most performed score ever written for the Broadway stage.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that West has been \"a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements\". Nieson elaborates, \"He is talented enough that he has made the calculation that you can dislike him and you will still listen to his music.\" Ed Ledsham from PopMatters said \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" Erik Nielson, a University of Richmond professor who teaches courses on hip-hop culture, opines that West is a \"mediocre rapper, but an extraordinary producer\". Nielson states, \"He will take a concept to an extreme, and flesh it out and explore it in some sort of depth,\" with a \"broad, eclectic range of sounds that he draws on that has opened up new possibilities for artists who came after him\". In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin described West as fronting a \"new art-pop era\" in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both extravagant wealth as well as creative exploration. Rolling Stone encapsulated West by calling him \"as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced\u2014a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture, and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up.\" AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact, \"As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century, West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold.\" West maintained a preppy fashion sense that helped expand hip-hop's definition of masculinity. Nielsen concedes that West \"definitely made it OK to be a little bit of a weirdo. He said when he came out that he wasn't a thug. He was the kid who went to school, his mom was a college professor. He definitely challenged some of the authenticity that had to be there at the moment.\" Rolling Stone credited West with transforming hip-hop's mainstream, \"establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap\", while Highsnobiety said his first three albums \u2013 \"a triumvirate of uber-successful records\" \u2013 \"cemented his role as a progressive rap progenitor\". West also has been credited with the commercial decline of the gangsta rap that once dominated mainstream hip-hop. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation marked a turning point in the music industry. With its emotive raps and confessional details, the album altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold to find wider mainstream acceptance. According to Ben Detrick of XXL magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to craft lyrical narratives about gunplay or drug-dealing. Rosie Swash of The Guardian deemed the sales competition a historical moment in hip-hop, because it \"highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.\" Billboard senior editor Alex Gale declared West \"absolutely one of the best, and you could make the argument for the best artist of the 21st century.\" Sharing similar sentiments, Complex called West the twenty-first century's \"most important artist of any art form, of any genre.\" The Atlantic writer David Samuels commented, \"Kanye's power resides in his wild creativity and expressiveness, his mastery of form, and his deep and uncompromising attachment to a self-made aesthetic that he expresses through means that are entirely of the moment: rap music, digital downloads, fashion, Twitter, blogs, live streaming video.\" Joe Muggs of The Guardian argued that \"there is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does [...] while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically.\" Drake, Nicki Minaj, Lil Uzi Vert and Casey Veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by West. He has been cited as a direct influence by artists and musical groups outside of hip-hop, including English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily Allen, R&B singer-songwriter Daniel Caesar, New Zealand pop artist Lorde and American electropop singer Halsey. Rock bands including Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, MGMT, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Fall Out Boy have cited West as an influence to their music. Experimental and electronic artists such as James Blake, Daniel Lopatin, and Tim Hecker have also cited West's work as an inspiration. Outside of his music career, West's success in the fashion industry has led to him being recognized as one of the most influential popular culture figures of his generation.

The Arnold arrangement was used for every Eighth Doctor audio play until 2008's Dead London. They proceeded to use this theme arrangement again from 2012's Dark Eyes onward. In 2005, the television series was revived. Murray Gold's theme arrangement featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added: an orchestral sound of low horns, strings and percussion and part of the Dalek ray-gun and TARDIS materialisation sound effects. Rapidly rising and falling strings is an element that was not present in any prior version of the theme. The sting once again served as the lead-in to the theme, but Gold omitted the \"middle eight\" from both the opening and closing credits. Gold has said that his interpretation was driven by the title visual sequence he was given to work around. Gold created a variation on his arrangement for the closing credits of \"The Christmas Invasion\", which was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. Unlike his arrangement for the 2005 series, this version restored the \"middle eight\"; it was also used for the closing credits of the 2006 and 2007 series. A soundtrack of Gold's incidental music for the new series was released by Silva Screen Records on 4 December 2006. Included on the album are two versions of the theme: the 44-second opening version, as arranged by Gold, and a longer arrangement that includes the middle eight. Often erroneously cited as being the same as the end credits version, this second version is in fact a new arrangement and recording. Gold also created another new arrangement of the theme which was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales during a special televised concert, Doctor Who: A Celebration which was broadcast in November 2006 as part of the annual Children in Need appeal.

The song premiered in April 2013 after several snippets of it appeared online and it was used in the trailer for the film. Amy Winehouse's father Mitchell Winehouse reported that Beyonc\u00e9 had not informed him about covering the song, and requested that the income coming from it should be donated to his Amy Winehouse Foundation. When the song was released, Winehouse criticized Andr\u00e9 3000's singing, saying that it should have been covered only by Beyonc\u00e9. However, Mark Ronson, the original producer of the song, revealed that he was flattered and honored by the cover version. Beyonc\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 3000's cover is slower than the original with several lyrical modifications. It features a darker production with heavier instrumentation complete with a guitar and synthesizers, chopped and screwed elements and electronic beats. Upon its release, the song received mixed reviews from music critics who noted that the original version was already perfect to be further reworked; several critics praised its reworked arrangement while others criticized the singers' vocal performance, calling it the most controversial song on the soundtrack.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Brad Grey, who received a writing credit on The Burning, became the chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, a position he held from 2005 until his death in 2017. Grey produced eight of the ten top-grossing films to come from the studio. Actress Holly Hunter won an Academy Award in 1993 for her performance in The Piano, and was also nominated for her performances in Broadcast News , The Firm , and Thirteen , as well as winning two Emmy Awards and receiving seven nominations.

Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement. Exploiting his embellished frontier legend , Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\". In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign. At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy. On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\". As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South. Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln. As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000\u2013200,000 copies. Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War. Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. His victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Minh Le, the mod's co-creator, had started his last semester at university, and wanted to do something in game development to help give him better job prospects. Throughout university, Le had worked on mods with the Quake engine, and on looking for this latest project, wanted to try something new and opted for GoldSrc. At the onset, Valve had not yet released the software development kit for GoldSrc but affirmed it would be available in a few months, allowing Le to work on the character models in the interim. Once the GoldSrc SDK was available, Le estimated it took him about a month and a half to complete the programming and integrate his models for \"Beta One\" of Counter-Strike. To assist, Le had help from Jess Cliffe who managed the game's website and community, and had contacts within level map making community to help build some of the levels for the game. The theme of countering terrorists was inspired by Le's own interest in guns and the military, and from games like Rainbow Six and Spec Ops. Le and Cliffe continued to release Betas on a frequent basis for feedback. The initial few Betas, released starting in June 1999, had limited audiences but by the fifth one, interest in the project dramatically grew. The interest in the game drew numerous players to the website, which helped Le and Cliffe to make revenue from ads hosted on the site. Around 2000 at the time of Beta 5's release, the two were approached by Valve, offering to buy the Counter-Strike intellectual property and offering both jobs to continue its development. Both accepted the offer, and by September 2000, Valve released the first non-beta version of the game. While Cliffe stayed with Valve, Le did some additional work towards a Counter-Strike 2.0 based on Valve's upcoming Source engine, but left to start his own studio after Valve opted to shelve the sequel. Counter-Strike itself is a mod, and it has developed its own community of script writers and mod creators. Some mods add bots, while others remove features of the game, and others create different modes of play. Some mods, often called \"admin plugins\", give server administrators more flexible and efficient control over their servers. There are some mods which affect gameplay heavily, such as Gun Game, where players start with a basic pistol and must score kills to receive better weapons, and Zombie Mod, where one team consists of zombies and must \"spread the infection\" by killing the other team . There are also Superhero mods which mix the first-person gameplay of Counter-Strike with an experience system, allowing a player to become more powerful as they continue to play. The game is highly customizable on the player's end, allowing the user to install or even create their own custom skins, HUDs, spray graphics, sprites, and sound effects, given the proper tools.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Winehouse predominantly based the album on her tumultuous relationship with then-ex-boyfriend and future husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who temporarily left her to pursue his previous ex-girlfriend. Their short-lived separation spurred her to create an album that explores themes of guilt, grief, infidelity, heartbreak and trauma in a relationship. Influenced by the pop and soul music of 1960s girl groups, Winehouse collaborated with producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson, along with Sharon Jones' band The Dap-Kings, to assist her on capturing the sounds from that time period while blending them with contemporary R&B and neo-soul music. Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded the album's songs with Remi at Instrumental Zoo Studios in Miami and then with Ronson and the Dap-Kings at Chung King Studios and Daptone Records in New York. Tom Elmhirst mixed the album at Metropolis Studios in London. Back to Black was acclaimed by music critics, who praised Winehouse's songwriting and emotive singing style as well as Remi and Ronson's production. The album spawned five singles: \"Rehab\", \"You Know I'm No Good\", \"Back to Black\", \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" and \"Love Is a Losing Game\". It has also been cited as being a key influence to the widespread popularity of British soul throughout the late 2000s, paving the musical landscape for artists such as Adele, Duffy, and Estelle. At the 2008 Grammy Awards, Back to Black won Best Pop Vocal Album and was also nominated for Album of the Year. At the same ceremony, Winehouse won four additional awards, tying her with five other artists as the second-most awarded female in a single ceremony. The album was also nominated at the 2007 Brit Awards for MasterCard British Album and was shortlisted for the 2007 Mercury Prize. Back to Black sold 3.58 million copies in the UK alone, becoming the UK's second best-selling album of the 21st century so far. The album has sold over 16 million copies worldwide. A deluxe edition of Back to Black was released in November 2007, containing a bonus disc of B-sides and live tracks. Winehouse's debut DVD I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London, released that same month, includes a live set recorded at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London and a 50-minute documentary detailing the singer's career over the previous four years.

This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased . In the story, the Doctor encounters both the Master and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series. Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need.

Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced. Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood , set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who.

He is banned from computers and touch-tone telephones until he is 18 years old. On his 18th birthday, he hacks into a local television station and changes the broadcast to an episode of The Outer Limits. Another hacker counters Dade's attack. Dade identifies himself as \"Crash Override\". At school, Dade becomes part of a group of hackers: Ramon \"The Phantom Phreak\" Sanchez, Emmanuel \"Cereal Killer\" Goldstein, Paul \"Lord Nikon\" Cook , Joey Pardella and Kate \"Acid Burn\" Libby \u2013 the hacker who kicked him out of the TV network earlier. Joey, out to prove his skills, breaks into \"The Gibson\", an Ellingson Mineral Corporation supercomputer. While downloading a garbage file as proof of his feat, his mother disconnects his computer leaving him with a fragmented file. However, his intrusion has been noticed and brought to the attention of computer security officer Eugene \"The Plague\" Belford, a former hacker. Plague realizes the garbage file being downloaded is a worm he himself inserted to defraud Ellingson. Claiming the file is the code to the \"Da Vinci\" computer virus that will capsize the company's oil tanker fleet, and pretending the hackers are to blame, he enlists the US Secret Service to recover the file. In fact, The Plague had inserted the \"Da Vinci\" virus as a red herring to cover for his worm. Joey is arrested and his computer searched, but he had hidden the disk containing the file. Dade and Kate make a bet, with Dade choosing a date with Kate should he win, and Kate having Dade perform menial computing tasks if she prevails. The hacking duel is to harass Secret Service Agent Richard Gill who was involved in Joey's arrest. After various hacks including canceling Gill's credit cards, creating a personal ad in his name, fabricating a criminal record, and changing his payroll status to \"deceased\", the duel remains a tie. Released on parole, Joey reveals the disk to Phreak who is arrested the next day and informs Kate the disk is hidden in a bathroom at school. Kate and Cereal Killer ask for Dade's help which he refuses as he has a record. He copies the disk so they have un-tampered evidence. Determining that Dade did not hack into Ellingson, The Plague sends him a powerful laptop with a request that he join him. He later threatens to have Dade's mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record. At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate's copy of the disk. Kate, Lord Nikon, Cereal Killer, and Dade learn that the code is a worm designed to salami-slice $25 million from Ellingson transactions, and that the Da Vinci virus is set to capsize the oil fleet the next day to provide cover and distract from the worm. Dade confesses that he gave Plague the disk and reveals his hacking history as \"Zero Cool\". Dade and Kate seek out Razor and Blade, producers of \"Hack the Planet\", a hacker-themed TV show. Lord Nikon and Cereal Killer learn that warrants for their arrest are to be executed at 9AM the next day. The next morning, Nikon and Cereal roller-blade from Washington Square Park, meeting up with Dade and Kate, while evading the Secret Service by hacking the traffic lights. Meeting up with Joey at Grand Central Terminal, they use payphones and acoustic couplers to hack the Gibson. At first, their attempts are easily rebuffed by Plague, who calls Dade to taunt him. Razor and Blade have contacted hackers around the world, who lend their support and distract Plague long enough for Joey to download the file. After crashing the Gibson, Dade and company are arrested. Dade surreptitiously informs Cereal Killer that he's tossed the disk in a trashcan.

{"id": "164_639", "question": "Who was the producer of Ivan?", "ctxs": [{"id": "292_17487", "text": "Ivan's notorious outbursts and autocratic whims helped characterise the position of tsar as one accountable to no earthly authority but only to God. Tsarist absolutism faced few serious challenges until the 19th century. The earliest and most influential account of his reign prior to 1917 was by the historian N.M.Karamzin, who described Ivan as a 'tormentor' of his people, particularly from 1560, though even after that date Karamzin believed there was a mix of 'good' and 'evil' in his character. In 1922, the historian Robert Wipper - who later returned to his native Latvia to avoid living under communist rule - wrote a biography that reassessed Ivan as a monarch \"who loved the ordinary people\" and praised his agrarian reforms. In the 1920s, Mikhail Pokrovsky, who dominated the study of history in the Soviet Union attributed  that the success of the Oprichnina to their being on the side of the small state owners and townsfolk in a decades class long struggle against the large landowners, and downgrade Ivan's role to that of the instrument of the emerging Russian bourgeoisie. But in February 1941, the poet Boris Pasternak observantly remarked in a letter to his cousin that \"the new cult, openly proselytized, is Ivan the Terrible, the Oprichnina, the brutality.\" Joseph Stalin, who had read Wipper's biography had decided that Soviet historians should praise the role of strong leaders, such as Ivan, Alexander Nevsky and Peter the Great, who had strengthened and expanded Russia. In post-Soviet Russia, a campaign has been run to seek the granting of sainthood to Ivan IV. but the Russian Orthodox Church opposed the idea. A consequence was that the writer Alexei Tolstoy began work on a stage version of Ivan's life, and Sergei Eisenstein began what was to be a three part film tribute to Ivan. Both projects were personally supervised by Stalin, at a time when the Soviet Union was engaged in a war with Nazi Germany. He read the scripts of Tolstoy's play and the first of Eisenstein's film in tandem after the Battle of Kursk in 1943, praised Eisenstein's version but rejected Tolstoy's. It took Tolstoy until 1944 to write a version that satisfied the dictator. Eisenstein's success with Ivan the Terrible Part 1 was not repeated with the follow-up, The Boyar's Revolt, which angered Stalin because it portrayed a man suffering pangs of conscience. Stalin told Eisenstein: \"Ivan the Terrible was very cruel. You can show that he was cruel, but you have to show why it was essential to be cruel. One of Ivan the Terrible's mistakes was that he didn't finish off the five major families.\" The film was suppressed until 1958. The first statue of Ivan the Terrible was officially open in Oryol, Russia in 2016.  Formally, the statue was unveiled in honor of the 450th anniversary of the founding of Oryol, a Russian city of about 310,000 that was established as a fortress to defend Moscow's southern borders. Informally, there was a big political subtext. The opposition thinks that Ivan the Terrible's rehabilitation echoes of Stalin's era. The erection of the statue was vastly covered in international media like The Guardian, The Washington Post, Politico, and others. The Russian Orthodox Church officially supported the erection of the monument. Ivan was a popular character in Russian and Bulgarian folklore. In classic Russian literature, Ivan appears in such famous works as Prince Serebrenni, The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov, The Tsar's Bride and others. The image of Ivan is played out in numerous operas and ballet Ivan the Terrible of Prokofiev. The Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein made two films based on Ivan's life and reign, Ivan the Terrible. The first part is about Ivan's early years. The second covers the period of his maturity. A third was planned but never completed. In Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, Ivan the Terrible is the one the trio of henchmen that assist Kahmunrah to conquer the world, alongside Napoleon and Al Capone. Tsar is a 2009 Russian drama film directed by Pavel Lungin. Ivan the Terrible is a major character in the Soviet-era fiction comedy Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future, based on a play by Mikhail Bulgakov. It was one of the most popular films in the Soviet Union in 1973 and sold more than 60 million tickets. Ivan appears as a major character in the novel The Ringed Castle , the fifth of the six novels in Dorothy Dunnett's historical fiction series, the Lymond Chronicles. Ivan was portrayed on BBC Radio 4 by David Threlfall in the radio play Ivan the Terrible: Absolute Power, written by Mike Walker and which was the first play in the first series of Tsar. The play was broadcast on 11 September 2016. A monstrous Rider version of Ivan the Terrible was depicted as a major character in the mobile game Fate Grand Order on the second chapter 'Cosmos in the Lostbelt's first story arc 'Permafrost Empire: Anastasia'. He appears as a slumbering titan and king of the human-monster hybrid locals called Yaga, forced into eternal sleep because of the sheer power of his ability to destroy his people and kept it under his rule for nearly 450 years. He later appears as a summonable character with the body of the monstrous version from the Lost Belt.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the 1958 George Chaloupka commissioned 64 paintings by local artists including Nym Bunduk, Charlie Mardigan and Charlie Brinken.

It is repeated three times with the drums and acoustic guitar before the vocal enters with the line: \"I can't get no satisfaction.\" The key is E major, but with the 3rd and 7th degree occasionally lowered, creating \u2013 in the first part of the verses \u2013 a distinctive mellow sound. The accompanying chords are borrowed from the E mixolydian scale, which is often used in blues and rock. The title line is an example of a negative concord. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then leaps half singing and half yelling into the chorus, where the guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's irritation and confusion with the increasing commercialism of the modern world, where the radio broadcasts \"useless information\" and a man on television tells him \"how white my shirts can be \u2013 but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me\", a reference to the then ubiquitous Marlboro Cowboy style advertisement. Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity, and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not getting any \"girl reaction\" was fairly controversial in its day, interpreted by some listeners as meaning a girl willing to have sex. Jagger commented that they \"didn't understand the dirtiest line\", as afterwards the girl asks him to return the following week as she is \"on a losing streak\", an apparent reference to menstruation. The song closes with a fairly subdued repetition of the song's title, followed suddenly by a full shout of the line, with the final words repeated into the fade-out. In its day the song was perceived as disturbing because of both its sexual connotations and the negative view of commercialism and other aspects of modern culture; critic Paul Gambaccini stated: \"The lyrics to this were truly threatening to an older audience. This song was perceived as an attack on the status quo.\" When the Rolling Stones performed the song on Shindig! in 1965, the line \"trying to make some girl\" was censored, although a performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on 13 February 1966 was uncensored.

Bob is also the head of Dimension Films, which continues to release genre films, though many of them heavily reedited by Weinstein, including the successful Scream slasher film franchise and five of the Halloween films. Harvey won an Academy Award for producing Shakespeare in Love and has garnered seven Tony Awards for producing a variety of winning plays and musicals, including The Producers, Billy Elliot the Musical, and August: Osage County. Brad Grey, who received a writing credit on The Burning, became the chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, a position he held from 2005 until his death in 2017. Grey produced eight of the ten top-grossing films to come from the studio. Actress Holly Hunter won an Academy Award in 1993 for her performance in The Piano, and was also nominated for her performances in Broadcast News , The Firm , and Thirteen , as well as winning two Emmy Awards and receiving seven nominations. Jason Alexander would star in the long-running, critically acclaimed sitcom Seinfeld as George Costanza. Fisher Stevens would star in The Flamingo Kid and Short Circuit , before turning to documentary directing, where he won an Academy Award for his film The Cove and an Independent Spirit Award for Crazy Love .

By 1923, the Republic claimed it could no longer afford the reparations payments required by the Versailles Treaty, and the government defaulted on some payments. In response, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr region, Germany's most productive industrial region at the time, taking control of most mining and manufacturing companies in January 1923. Strikes were called, and passive resistance was encouraged. These strikes lasted eight months, further damaging both the economy and society. The strike prevented some goods from being produced, but one industrialist, Hugo Stinnes, was able to create a vast empire out of bankrupt companies. Because the production costs in Germany were falling almost hourly, the prices for German products were unbeatable. Stinnes made sure that he was paid in dollars, which meant that by mid-1923, his industrial empire was worth more than the entire German economy. By the end of the year, over two hundred factories were working full-time to produce paper for the spiralling bank note production. Stinnes' empire collapsed when the government-sponsored inflation was stopped in November 1923. In 1919, one loaf of bread cost 1 mark; by 1923, the same loaf of bread cost 100\u00a0billion marks. Since striking workers were paid benefits by the state, much additional currency was printed, fuelling a period of hyperinflation. The 1920s German inflation started when Germany had no goods to trade. The government printed money to deal with the crisis; this meant payments within Germany were made with worthless paper money, and helped formerly great industrialists to pay back their own loans. This also led to pay raises for workers and for businessmen who wanted to profit from it. Circulation of money rocketed, and soon banknotes were being overprinted to a thousand times their nominal value and every town produced its own promissory notes; many banks and industrial firms did the same. The value of the Papiermark had declined from 4.2 marks per U.S. dollar in 1914 to one million per dollar by August 1923. This led to further criticism of the Republic. On 15 November 1923, a new currency, the Rentenmark, was introduced at the rate of one trillion Papiermark for one Rentenmark, an action known as redenomination. At that time, one U.S. dollar was equal to 4.2 Rentenmark. Reparation payments were resumed, and the Ruhr was returned to Germany under the Locarno Treaties, which defined the borders between Germany, France, and Belgium.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The country is the largest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, constituting 40% of the monetary union's total GDP. The country is the world's largest exporter of cocoa beans, and the fourth-largest exporter of goods, in general, in sub-Saharan Africa . In 2009, cocoa-bean farmers earned $2.53 billion for cocoa exports and were projected to produce 630,000 metric tons in 2013. Ivory Coast also has 100,000 rubber farmers who earned a total of $105 million in 2012. Close ties to France since independence in 1960, diversification of agricultural exports, and encouragement of foreign investment have been factors in the economic growth of Ivory Coast. In recent years, Ivory Coast has been subject to greater competition and falling prices in the global marketplace for its primary agricultural crops: coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower, those exporting into foreign markets, and the labour force, inasmuch as instances of indentured labour have been reported in the country's cocoa and coffee production in every edition of the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor since 2009. Ivory Coast's economy has grown faster than that of most other African countries since independence. One possible reason for this might be taxes on export agriculture.

Producers needed a script for a sequel  but James Wan and Leigh Whannell, director and writer of Saw, were working on Universal Pictures's Dead Silence. Music video director Darren Lynn Bousman had just completed a script for his first film The Desperate, and was trying to sell it to studios but was getting reactions that the script was very similar to Saw. A German studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce the film for $1 million. Just as they were looking for a cinematographer, the American cinematographer David A. Armstrong, who had worked on Saw, arrived on the scene and suggested showing the script to Saw producer Gregg Hoffman. Hoffman read the script and called Bousman wanting to produce The Desperate. Bousman was initially upset when he heard about his script's similarities to Saw, and feared at first that Lions Gate's call was due to complaints of plagiarism. After Hoffman showed the script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules, the two decided that The Desperate was the starting script they needed for Saw II and two months later, Bousman was flown to Toronto to direct. Whannell polished the script, with input from Wan, in order to bring it into the Saw universe, but kept the characters, traps and deaths from The Desperate script. Bousman said, \"But you could read the script for The Desperate and watch Saw II, and you would not be able to draw a comparison\". Bousman's first draft for The Desperate consisted in an X-rated violent film, but after Bousman's agent found difficult to have the script bought because most studios were turned off due to the level of violence, Bousman modified his script to be an R-rated film, which is when the executives of Lions Gate were turned on his potential. Overall, the framework of The Desperate had a similar bleak, disgusting atmosphere and a twist ending, which is why the Lions Gate executives found parallels in the script's style. Wan and Whannell also served as executive producers. All the previous film's crew members returned: editor Kevin Greutert, cinematographer Armstrong, and composer Charlie Clouser. This was to be Hoffman's last film. He died unexpectedly on December 4, 2005. Only those key cast and crew members who were involved in the film's ending were given the full script; the rest received only the first 88 pages. If a particular page was rewritten, the old page was shredded. Members were also required to sign confidentiality agreements requiring them not to release any plot details. Reportedly, \"four or five\" alternate endings were shot in order to keep the ending a surprise. Bousman gave the actors freedom to change dialogue in the script. He said that 95% of the time, the actors went by the script, with about 5% being adlibs, which he said \"made all of the difference in the world\". Donnie Wahlberg was allowed to modify some pieces of dialogue, especially those of Eric Matthews' interactions with his son Daniel and Jigsaw. For the former, Wahlberg added the line of what was the last thing Eric told Daniel basing it on what he says to his first son before hanging up the phone. For the latter, Wahlberg felt that the relationship between Eric and Jigsaw was \"too dicey\" and should emphasize Eric's need to sit with Jigsaw to rescue his son; Tobin Bell agreed with most of these changes, which Wahlberg added after finishing shooting every day, and the two improsived together on set. Hoffman said in an interview with Fangoria that they listened to fans' suggestions. For instance, instead of only showing the aftermath of a character violently dying in a flashback, they would allow it to unfold as it happened. This was in contrast to Saw, in which most of the violence was implied off-screen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The answer is that Mr. Langdon has once again capitulated to his omnipotent band of gag-men. It may be all very well for Harold Lloyd to rely on mechanical twists, but Langdon possesses a cherubic countenance, which offers him a chance in other directions...Mr. Langdon is still Charles Spencer Chaplin's sincerest flatterer. His short coat reminds one of Chaplin, and now and again his footwork is like that of the great screen comedian.\" Film historian David Kalat reports that Buster Keaton, a long-time fan of Langdon's known for his own morbid jokes about death and killings, criticized a scene in which Langdon's character tries to kill Priscilla as \"going too far\" in making light of murder. More recently, critic Maria Schneider reviewed Langdon's work and wrote, \"Long Pants , also directed by Capra, was a peculiar change of pace for Langdon, and possibly an attempt to poke fun at his baby-faced image by casting him as a would-be lady-killer; sporting little of the ingenuity of The Strong Man, it was a box-office failure that set off the comedian's quick decline into obscurity. An acquired taste, Harry Langdon's gentle absurdities and slow rhythms take some getting used to, but patient viewers will be rewarded.\" Film critic Hal Erikson wrote of the film, \"Few comedies of the 1920s were as bizarre and surreal as Harry Langdon's Long Pants... Written by future director Arthur Ripley, Long Pants is as kinky as any of Ripley's film noirs of the 1940s.

A 1966 letter from Gloag to Clayton suggests that 20th Century Fox was interested in producing a film adaptation and that Eleanor Perry had written a script, but it was acquired for Clayton by MGM and Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff. Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\". Richard Burton was the first choice to play Charlie, but it was thought that his fee would push the budget too high, so Bogarde was cast in the role. The juvenile cast was led by Pamela Franklin, who had worked with Clayton in The Innocents. Yootha Joyce had worked with Clayton in an acclaimed cameo role in Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . Our Mother's House is the second in a loose trilogy of films in which Clayton explored themes of the occult and of children in isolated situations who are threatened by evil. He most famously essayed these subjects in The Innocents, his acclaimed adaptation of Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\", and he returned to it in the 1980s with his screen adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes . In his 1975 memoir, Dirk Bogarde recounted his experience with the production in glowing terms: \"On my first morning in the gloomy house in Croydon I was in a bit of a funk. Eight pairs of eyes, ranging from five to fourteen, gazed at me solemnly. Not a smile, no welcoming grin even. In the little caravan in the scrubby front garden which I had been given to change in there was a jam jar stuffed with privet and some wilting Michaelmas daisies. Under it was a note. 'Let's hope you're as good as you're cracked up to be. You'd better be.

Fonda wished to make a film about the Vietnam War inspired by her friendship with Ron Kovic, a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran, whom she had met at an antiwar rally. At that time, Kovic had recently completed his autobiographical book Born on the Fourth of July, which later became an Oscar-winning motion picture of the same name directed by Oliver Stone, starring Tom Cruise as Kovic. In 1972, Fonda hired Nancy Dowd, a friend from her days in the feminist movement, to write a script about the consequences of the war as seen through the eyes of a military wife. Originally, Dowd's story, tentatively titled Buffalo Ghosts, focused on two women, volunteers at a veterans' hospital, who must come to grips with the emotional toll that the war takes on its casualties and their families. The project dragged on for six years until Gilbert and producer Jerome Hellman took it. The screenplay was reshaped significantly by the circle of talent who eventually brought it to the screen: Fonda, Ashby, Wexler, Jon Voight, producer Hellman and screenwriters Waldo Salt and Robert C. Jones. They were united by their opposition to the Vietnam War and by their concern for the veterans who were returning to America and facing difficulties adapting to life back home. Rudy Wurlitzer contributed uncredited work to the script. John Schlesinger, who had worked with producers Hellman and Voight on Midnight Cowboy, was originally named the director, but he left the project after feeling uncomfortable with the subject matter. He was replaced by Hal Ashby. Fonda was cast from the beginning as Sally Hyde, the housewife. A top box-office star was sought for the male lead to offset the grim nature of the story. Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Sylvester Stallone were all offered the part, but declined. Jon Voight had been considered for the role of the husband, but after becoming involved with the film, he campaigned to play the paraplegic veteran. Voight had participated in the anti-war movement and was a friend of Fonda, who was instrumental in helping him land the role, even though he had fallen from popularity since his Midnight Cowboy heyday. Bruce Dern, long stereotyped in sadistic roles, was chosen as the husband. The screenplay was written and rewritten until the project could wait no longer. Jane Fonda, who just finished Julia , was soon to star in Alan J. Pakula's Comes a Horseman . For director Ashby, this was his second film about the 1960s, in addition to his 1975 film Shampoo. Ashby had cast singer-songwriter Guthrie Thomas to portray the role of Bill Munson after reviewing Thomas' screen test. Thomas joined his close friend Ashby and the entire cast at a restaurant by Malibu Beach before the start of production. Thomas had been previously cast in a previous Ashby film, Bound for Glory, starring David Carradine. Upon completion of the cast meeting, Thomas privately spoke with Ashby and told him, \"Hal, I am a singer-songwriter as you know and not an actor.

While growing up, however, he observed more urbanization taking place in the town where he lived and as a result, the insect population declined. Tajiri noticed that kids now played in their homes instead of outside and he came up with the idea of a video game, containing creatures that resembled insects, called Pok\u00e9mon. He thought kids could relate with the Pok\u00e9mon by individually naming them, and then controlling them to represent fear or anger as a good way of relieving stress. However, Pok\u00e9mon never bleed nor die in battle, only faint\u00a0\u2013 this was a very touchy subject to Tajiri, as he did not want to further fill the gaming world with \"pointless violence\". When the Game Boy was released, Tajiri thought the system was perfect for his idea, especially because of the link cable, which he envisioned would allow players to trade Pok\u00e9mon with each other. This concept of trading information was new to the video game industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition. \"I imagined a chunk of information being transferred by connecting two Game Boys with special cables, and I went wow, that's really going to be something!\" said Tajiri. Upon hearing of the Pok\u00e9mon concept, Shigeru Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pok\u00e9mon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect. Tajiri was also influenced by Square's Game Boy game The Final Fantasy Legend, noting in an interview that the game gave him the idea that more than just action games could be developed for the handheld. The main characters were named after Tajiri himself as Satoshi, who is described as Tajiri in his youth, and his long-time friend, role model, mentor, and fellow Nintendo developer, Shigeru Miyamoto, as Shigeru. Ken Sugimori, an artist and longtime friend of Tajiri, headed the development of drawings and designs of the Pok\u00e9mon, working with a team of fewer than ten people who conceived the various designs for all 151 Pok\u00e9mon. Atsuko Nishida created the designs for Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and many others. Sugimori, in turn, finalized each design, drawing the Pok\u00e9mon from various angles in order to assist Game Freak's graphics department in properly rendering the creature. Music for the game was composed by Junichi Masuda, who utilized the four sound channels of the Game Boy to create both the melodies and the sound effects and Pok\u00e9mon \"cries\" heard upon encountering them. He noted the game's opening theme, titled \"Monster\", was produced with the image of battle scenes in mind, using white noise to sound like marching music and imitate a snare drum. Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title went through several transitions due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri always thought that Nintendo would reject his game, as the company did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games turned out to be a success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Tajiri said that the Pok\u00e9 Ball concept was inspired by Ultraseven's Capsule Monsters from the tokusatsu superhero television series Ultraseven .Nintendo spent $13 million marketing Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue in the United States.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_660", "question": "Who was the producer of X?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_53645", "text": "\"Soft Light\" was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by James A. Contner. Prior to writing this episode, Gilligan, who had long been a fan of the show, learned that his agent was a relative of series creator Chris Carter. Thanks to this connection, he was allowed to meet Carter. During this meet, Carter asked Gilligan if he had any episode ideas, to which Gilligan quickly noted that he had been observing his shadow and thought it would be \"creepy\" if it began moving independently. Carter asked Gilligan to develop a script based on the idea as a freelance project . This episode was thus one of the first episodes to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow to be able to move independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect, which ended up \"sav[ing] an enormous amount of money in animation costs\", according to Gilligan. After reading the first draft, Carter also felt that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be \"more than just paranoia\". He thus wrote X into the story; writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, \"It had been a long time since X had done anything and the character really needed to grow.\" Gilligan himself inserted a reference to the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first-season episodes \"Squeeze\" and \"Tooms\" in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder. The episode guest stars Tony Shalhoub as Dr. Banton. Shalhoub, who had a recurring role on the NBC series Wings, was not familiar with The X-Files when he was offered the part because at the time he did not watch much television. However, after reading the script for \"Soft Light\", he enjoyed the story due to its The Twilight Zone-esque nature. When Shalhoub informed people that he had secured a part in The X-Files, he claimed that \"the response was unbelievable\". Shalhoub was impressed with the on-location filming that the series did; he noted, \"Ninety-nine percent of our filming on Wings is done on a soundstage, while most of [The X-Files] is shot on location in and around Vancouver. It's an ideal city because it gives producers so many options.\" Both the Pacific Central Station and the Pacific Marine Training Institute in Vancouver stood in for the train station featured in the episode. Initially, the Pacific Marine Training Institute would only give the series permission to film after 5pm, but the show's producers eventually talked the dean of the station into letting production begin at 2 in the afternoon. Because he was a fan of the series, Gilligan traveled to Vancouver and video recorded the filming of \"Soft Light\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Seto attached himself to the project because the film was very popular and, therefore, had \"a certain level of marketing value\". The project was officially announced on 30 June 2003 and the release of vol. 1 was scheduled to coincide with the film's US premiere in August, but the film was pushed back. The Miramax film corporation bought the American film rights to Shaolin Soccer before its release in China, so they helped publish the comic book along with two Chinese film companies who originally produced the film. Volumes 1 and 2 were released in August and November 2003 and sold for US$13.95 each. Their suggested reading level was age 13 and above. Seto worked to make the novel as faithful to the film as possible but he admits that Stephen Chow's brand of Mo lei tau comedy does not translate well into illustrations. He stated in an interview that \"the Shaolin Soccer comic is 80% movie adaptation with 20% new content.\" This new content includes a backstory about Steel Leg's training in Shaolin before the death of his master, as well as completely rewriting entire sections of the movie. For example, in the film a group of bar thugs beat up Sing and Iron Head after listening to their lounge-style tribute to Shaolin kung fu. The following day, Sing seeks out the group and uses his Shaolin skills to beat the thugs using a soccer ball. Fung sees the brawl and comes up with the idea of fusing kung fu and soccer. However, in the comic book, Sing is meditating in the park when he gets hit in the head with a soccer ball. The cocky players mock him and destroy a stone statue of his deceased master. Sing proceeds to use the soccer ball as a weapon. Another example is the fact the characters are visually different from the film. All of their comic book personas look to be in their twenties to thirties, with highly toned athletic physiques ; even Iron Head, who was the eldest of the six brothers, appears younger than he should. Several online reviews have criticised the American adaptation for its apparent lack of story line coherence, mixture of realistic and cartoonish drawing styles, and bad Chinese-to-English translation, among other issues. In regards to the translation, one reviewer stated, \"It's almost as if the book was translated with a first-year English student referencing a Chinese-to-English dictionary, with strangely assembled sentences and strange bursts of dialogue peppering the pages.\" Another common complaint was that the comics seemed to be geared towards those people who had previously seen the movie.

He discovered Eric Liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon a reference book on the Olympics while housebound from the flu in a rented house in Los Angeles. Screenwriter Colin Welland, commissioned by Puttnam, did an enormous amount of research for his Academy Award-winning script. Among other things, he took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics, went to the National Film Archives for pictures and footage of the 1924 Olympics, and interviewed everyone involved who was still alive. Welland just missed Abrahams, who died on 14 January 1978, but he did attend Abrahams' February 1978 memorial service, which inspired the present-day framing device of the film. Aubrey Montague's son saw Welland's newspaper ad and sent him copies of the letters his father had sent home \u2013 which gave Welland something to use as a narrative bridge in the film. Except for changes in the greetings of the letters from \"Darling Mummy\" to \"Dear Mum\" and the change from Oxford to Cambridge, all of the readings from Montague's letters are from the originals. Welland's original script also featured, in addition to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have anything to do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay. Initial financing towards development costs was provided by Goldcrest Films, who then sold the project to Allied, but kept a percentage of the profits. Ian Charleson wrote Eric Liddell's speech to the post-race workingmen's crowd at the Scotland v. Ireland races. Charleson, who had studied the Bible intensively in preparation for the role, told director Hugh Hudson that he didn't feel the portentous and sanctimonious scripted speech was either authentic or inspiring. Hudson and Welland allowed him to write words he personally found inspirational instead. Puttnam chose Hugh Hudson, a multiple award-winning advertising and documentary filmmaker who had never helmed a feature film, to direct Chariots of Fire. Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies.

Years later, after finishing the film Pi, Aronofsky was searching for ideas for his next film and thought a film about Noah would be a good idea. Work on the script began in 2000, but Aronofsky put the project on hold when he learned Hallmark was already working on a similar film. Work on the draft resumed sometime later, and a first draft was completed in 2003. Aronofsky struggled with how to adapt the story as a feature-length film, as, in the Bible, it is only four chapters long. The biblical text does not include the names of the wives of Noah or his sons, but it does mention Noah getting drunk after the flood and getting into an altercation with one of his sons, which gave Aronofsky and his team ideas for events that might have taken place on the ark. In April 2007, Aronofsky discussed Noah with The Guardian, explaining that he saw Noah as \"a dark, complicated character\" who experiences \"real survivor's guilt\" after the flood. Aronofsky was working on early drafts of the script for Noah around the time his first attempt to make The Fountain fell through when actor Brad Pitt left the project. Ari Handel, who had previously collaborated with Aronofsky on The Fountain, The Wrestler, and Black Swan, helped Aronofsky develop the script. Before they found financial backing for Noah, they collaborated with Canadian artist Niko Henrichon to adapt the script as a graphic novel. The first volume of the graphic novel was released in the French language by Belgian publisher Le Lombard in October 2011 under the title No\u00e9: Pour la cruaut\u00e9 des hommes . After the creation of the graphic novel, Aronofsky struck a deal with Paramount and New Regency to produce a feature film of Noah with a budget of $130 million. Screenwriter John Logan was asked to re-draft the script alongside Aronofsky, but is not credited for his contributions in the completed film. In October 2012, Emma Watson commented on the setting of the film: \"I think what Darren's going for is a sense that it could be set in any time.

Manette's young daughter is able to be spirited out of the country to England by her guardian the British banker Jarvis Lorry, where she is brought up by Miss Pross. Ernest Defarge swears vengeance on d'Evremonde and will not rest until the entire family has been wiped out. Many years later Doctor Manette is released. His time in the Bastille has left him institutionalised and he initially finds it hard to adjust to life outside the prison. Jarvis Lorry and Manette's now-grown daughter Lucy come to Paris to escort him to England. On the journey back they encounter a young man named Charles Darnay, who is the son of Marquis d'Evremonde, fleeing France because his liberal views clash with those of his father. Darnay and Lucy soon fall in love, but their hopes of marriage are threatened when Darnay is arrested on his arrival in England for espionage and high treason as an alleged French spy. Darnay's accuser is the unscrupulous Barsad, who is himself in the pay of the French government. Darnay's defence case is worked on by an dissolute Englishman, Sidney Carton, whose young idealism has given way to a self-loathing cynicism. Carton bears a striking resemblance to Darnay and uses this in court to discredit Barsad's evidence in court, by raising doubts over Barsad's claims that he clearly saw and heard Darnay talking treason. Darnay is acquitted, and he plans to marry Lucy. Carton is befriended by Lucy, and developing an unrequited attachment for her, he tries to mend his ways and give up his heavy drinking. In France, the oppression of the poor finally drives them to breaking point and the French Revolution breaks out. Evremonde, who has been particularly exploitative of his tenants, is murdered in his bed by Ernest Defarge and Charles Darnay inherits his title as Marquis. Desperate to get their hands on the new aristocrat, Defarge and his colleagues trick Darnay into returning to France to assist an old faithful family servant who is now in trouble. Darnay is arrested and accused of being both an aristocrat and a British spy. Carton has traveled to Paris with Lucy, Lorry and others to try to help Darnay. He pleads Darnay's case and points out how liberal his views are and how he hated his father. He adds by pointing out that Darnay had been accused of treason in Britain and was hated there, to discredit the accusation of espionage. Darnay is released, but Defarge is determined to wipe out the last of the d'Evremondes. He has Darnay re-arrested after producing an ancient letter written by Doctor Manette condemning all Evremondes and this shifts the court against Darnay, who is sentenced to be executed by guillotine. Realising that Darnay is now facing almost certain death, Carton hatches an outlandish plan to switch places with him based on their facial similarities. He bribes his way into the prison, smuggles Darnay out and takes his place in the condemned cell. In sparing Darnay's life, and securing Lucy's happiness, Carton is able to restore his long vanished sense of self-worth. The following day, while Lucy and Darnay escape safely from Paris, he goes to his death calmly and at peace with himself and the world The film, like the play, adds a character named Mimi who is a young waif who is rescued by Carton and works in his house.

This original drawing, a frowning character with its mouth wide open, resembled characteristics of Phoney Bone, the grouchy cousin to Fone Bone. In 1970, when Smith was ten, he began making these drawings into comics. The comics had many major influences throughout their creation. For example, Smith tried to pattern Bone structurally around Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. He enjoyed how it was a story which \"startoff very simple, almost like children's stories... but as it goes on, it gets a little darker, and the themes become a little more sophisticated and more complex\". Smith was also taken by Carl Barks' character Scrooge McDuck. Smith said that he \"always wanted Uncle Scrooge to go on a longer adventure. I thought, 'Man, if you could just get a comic book of that quality, the length of say, War and Peace, or The Odyssey or something, that would be something I would love to read, and even as a kid I looked everywhere for that book, that Uncle Scrooge story that was 1,100 pages long\". Other influences in this regard include the original Star Wars trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and the classic fairy tales and mythologies that inspired those works. Moby Dick, Smith's favorite book, is cited for its multi-layered narrative and symbolism, numerous references to it are placed throughout Bone. Bone was also informed by other comics including Peanuts and Walt Kelly's comic strip Pogo. While Smith attended the Ohio State University, he created a comic strip called \"Thorn\" for the student newspaper, The Lantern, which included some of the characters who later featured in Bone. After college, Smith and his friends produced animation work on commission in their studio, Character Builders Inc., but Smith eventually came to decide that it was not the type of cartooning he wished to do. Drawn to the idea that he could produce his own animated-type story but in the comics medium, and convinced by Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Art Spiegelman's Maus that a serious comic book with a beginning, middle and end structure was both artistically and commercially viable, Smith decided to produce Bone. In 1991, Smith launched his company, Cartoon Books, to publish the series. Initially, Smith self-published the book, which meant that he did all the work required to both produce and distribute the series as a business himself, including answering letters, doing all the graphics and lettering , sending the artwork to the printer, handling orders and bookkeeping. This made it difficult to focus on writing and drawing the book, and as a result, he fell behind in his production. To remedy this, he asked his wife, Vijaya, to quit her lucrative job at a Silicon Valley startup company to run the business side of Bone as the President of Cartoon Books. As a result, Smith was able to refocus on drawing, and sales improved. In 1995, Smith began publishing Bone through Image Comics. Smith believed this would be a temporary arrangement, and to maintain the book's place in catalogs, the collected volumes remained under the Cartoon Books label. During the title's time at Image, the first 27 issues were reprinted by Image with new covers, which are distinguished by the Image logo in the upper left-hand corner of the cover. The Cartoon Books printings have black back covers, inset with a single panel reprinted from inside. First printings can be distinguished from later printings by changes in the color of the logo on the front cover. The comic and its story ended with its 55th issue, dated June 2004. The back cover has, in place of the usual comic panel, a black-and-white photo of Smith in his studio drawing the last page on May 10.

The state was created by the 1706 Treaty of Union and ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament at the Palace of Westminster, but distinct legal systems \u2013 English law and Scots law \u2013 remained in use. The formerly separate kingdoms had been in personal union since the 1603 \"Union of the Crowns\" when James VI of Scotland became King of England and King of Ireland. Since James's reign, who had been the first to refer to himself as \"king of Great Britain\", a political union between the two mainland British kingdoms had been repeatedly attempted and aborted by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. Queen Anne did not produce a clear Protestant heir and endangered the line of succession, with the laws of succession differing in the two kingdoms and threatening a return to the throne of Scotland of the Roman Catholic House of Stuart, exiled in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The resulting kingdom was in legislative and personal union with the Kingdom of Ireland from its inception, but the Parliament of Great Britain resisted early attempts to incorporate Ireland in the political union. The early years of the newly united kingdom were marked by Jacobite risings, particularly the Jacobite rising of 1715. The relative incapacity or ineptitude of the Hanoverian kings resulted in a growth in the powers of Parliament and a new role, that of \"prime minister\", emerged in the heyday of Robert Walpole. The \"South Sea Bubble\" economic crisis was brought on by the failure of the South Sea Company, an early joint-stock company. The campaigns of Jacobitism ended in defeat for the Stuarts' cause in 1746. The Hanoverian line of monarchs gave their names to the Georgian era and the term \"Georgian\" is typically used in the contexts of social and political history for Georgian architecture. The term \"Augustan literature\" is often used for Augustan drama, Augustan poetry and Augustan prose in the period 1700\u20131740s. The term \"Augustan\" refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of classical Latin from the ancient Roman Republic. Victory in the Seven Years' War led to the dominance of the British Empire, which was to become the foremost global power for over a century. Great Britain would dominate the Indian subcontinent through the trading and military expansion of the East India Company in colonial India. In wars against France, it gained control of both Upper and Lower Canada, and until suffering defeat in the American War of Independence, it also had dominion over the Thirteen Colonies. From 1787, Britain began the colonisation of New South Wales with the departure of the First Fleet in the process of penal transportation to Australia. Britain was a leading belligerent in the French Revolutionary Wars. Great Britain was merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801, with the Acts of Union 1800, enacted by Great Britain and Ireland, under George III, to merge with it the Kingdom of Ireland.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny , his deceptive fianc\u00e9e Lisa and his conflicted best friend Mark . A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events. The stage play from which the film is derived was so-called due to its events taking place entirely in a single room. A number of publications have labeled The Room as one of the worst films ever made. An assistant professor of film studies was the first to describe The Room as \"the Citizen Kane of bad movies.\" Originally shown only in a limited number of California theaters, The Room quickly became a cult film due to its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, and Wiseau's off-kilter performance. Although Wiseau has retrospectively described the film as a black comedy, audiences have generally viewed it as a poorly made drama, an opinion shared by some of the cast. The Disaster Artist, Sestero's memoir of the making of The Room, was co-written with Tom Bissell and published in 2013. A film of the same title based on the book, directed by and starring James Franco, was released on December 1, 2017; the book and film received widespread acclaim and numerous award nominations.

It's not as violent as the comic book,\" and  \"The script that I've read is obviously different from the comic, because I don't think the comic gives you enough for a two-hour movie.\" In November 2009, Helen Mirren was reported to be engaged to work alongside Freeman and Willis in the film. Also in November 2009, John C. Reilly and Mary-Louise Parker were in negotiations to join the cast. Reilly would play a retired CIA agent who is paranoid that everyone is out to kill him. Parker would play the romantic interest, a federal pension worker who becomes embroiled in the Willis character's struggle to stay alive. In the same month, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss, and Brian Cox entered negotiations to join the cast.

It was released on November 5, 2002, by Jive Records. The album was written and recorded in a six-week period as Timberlake's band NSYNC was on hiatus. Half of the tracks were originally written for Michael Jackson by the Neptunes and later modified. For his solo album, Timberlake began to adopt a more mature image as an R&B artist opposed to the previous pop music recorded by the group. The majority of the album was produced by the Neptunes and Timbaland, and features guest appearances by Janet Jackson, Clipse, and Bubba Sparxxx. Primarily an R&B album, Justified also contains influences of dance-pop, funk, and soul music. Justified received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented the mature progression of Timberlake's material, although some criticized its lyrical content. The album earned Timberlake four Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, and won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Justified debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and sold 439,000 copies in its first week. It was certified three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , having sold over 3.9 million copies in the US. As of 2012, the album has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Four singles were released from Justified. The lead single \"Like I Love You\" peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while the follow-up singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\" peaked within the top five on the chart. \"Like I Love You\", \"Cry Me a River\", and \"Rock Your Body\" peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and in the top ten in Australia , Ireland, Netherlands, and Belgium. To promote the album, Timberlake performed on several television shows and award ceremonies, including the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he made his solo debut appearance. Furthermore, Timberlake embarked on two concert tours: The Justified World Tour and the Justified and Stripped Tour; on the latter, he was accompanied by Christina Aguilera.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Based on a story by O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, it follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo,  who encounter the eponymous Alien, an aggressive and deadly extraterrestrial set loose on the ship. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto. It was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill through their company Brandywine Productions, and was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script; Shusett was executive producer. The Alien and its accompanying artifacts were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human settings. Alien premiered May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival, presented in 70mm at midnight. It received a wide release on June 22 and was released September 6 in the United Kingdom. It was met with mixed reviews on release but was a box-office success, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, three Saturn Awards , and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. In 2002, Alien was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2008, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as the seventh-best film in the science-fiction genre, and as the 33rd-greatest film of all time by Empire. The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting career, providing her with her first lead role. The story of her character's encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels Aliens , Alien 3 , and Alien Resurrection . A crossover with the Predator franchise produced the Alien vs. Predator films: Alien vs. Predator and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem .

The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players. Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, \"violet buildings\" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game. Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger. Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The country is the largest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, constituting 40% of the monetary union's total GDP. The country is the world's largest exporter of cocoa beans, and the fourth-largest exporter of goods, in general, in sub-Saharan Africa . In 2009, cocoa-bean farmers earned $2.53 billion for cocoa exports and were projected to produce 630,000 metric tons in 2013. Ivory Coast also has 100,000 rubber farmers who earned a total of $105 million in 2012. Close ties to France since independence in 1960, diversification of agricultural exports, and encouragement of foreign investment have been factors in the economic growth of Ivory Coast. In recent years, Ivory Coast has been subject to greater competition and falling prices in the global marketplace for its primary agricultural crops: coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower, those exporting into foreign markets, and the labour force, inasmuch as instances of indentured labour have been reported in the country's cocoa and coffee production in every edition of the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor since 2009. Ivory Coast's economy has grown faster than that of most other African countries since independence. One possible reason for this might be taxes on export agriculture. Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Kenya were exceptions as their rulers were themselves large cash-crop producers, and the newly independent countries desisted from imposing penal rates of taxation on export agriculture, with the result that their economies were doing well.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A tremendous success, Rinaldo created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music , a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance. Ottone, an opera by Handel presented for the Academy in January 1723, was the first time London audiences had seen the operatic superstars, castrato Senesino and soprano Francesca Cuzzoni, performing together in an opera, and had been an immense success, with demand for tickets far outstripping supply Flavio, following Ottone in the same year and with the same leading singers, did not create such a sensation as Ottone had, although it was successful enough with audiences to be revived by Handel in a subsequent season. One reason for this may have been Flavios comparative brevity, as announced in the playbills by the AcademyAt the King's Theatre...this present Tuesday...will be performed a New Opera call'd, FLAVIUS...By reason of the shortness of the Opera, to begin exactly at Eight a-Clock. Flavio also mixes high tragedy with amorous intrigue and comic interludes, which was perhaps not what London audiences, who had become accustomed to heroic dramas on a consistent note of serious drama in Italian opera, were expecting. The work is lightly scored mostly for strings and continuo instruments only, with woodwinds being used sparingly. Handel's music treats some of the complications of the plot with mock-heroic irony, but the more serious passages produce intense dramatic music from the composer. 18th century musicologist Charles Burney praised the aria \" Amor, nel mio penar\" written for Senesino as Guido, torn between love and duty, as \"extremely pathetic\" and the aria for Emilia, \"Amante stravagante\" became a popular success as a separate song with English words fitted to it as \"See, see, my charmer flyes me\". During rehearsals for Flavio, the tenor Alexander Gordon became frustrated with Handel's direction of the music from the harpsichord and threatened to jump on the instrument, to which Handel replied \"Oh! Let me know when you will do that and I will advertise it. For I am sure more people will come to see you jump than to hear you sing.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The character of Dave was meant to be a side of Hurley who felt he had no problem, and encourages Hurley to overeat, and is played by Evan Handler in a way director Jack Bender described as \"mischievous, impish-like\". Showrunner Carlton Cuse revealed his name comes from Hurley's father, David Reyes - who would later appear in the series played by Cheech Marin - because the writers \"wanted Hurley to imagine a friend and have that be wrapped up in his unresolved relationship with his dad\". The final scene with Libby was so secret that only Jack Bender and his assistant director had it in their scripts, and to prevent Libby from being the only woman in the mental institution, every woman on the set, including Bender's daughter Sophie, was dressed in robes and pajamas to appear as background characters. Director Bender decided to depict Dave in a way audiences would first believe him to be real, but without the character actually interacting with the physical world, similar to films such as The Sixth Sense and A Beautiful Mind. For the scene in which Dave walks through the jungle with Hurley, red and orange flowers were placed to add some \"magic\" to the scene, something Bender described as a \"'Hurley in Wonderland' feel\". The scene in which Hurley attacks Sawyer was intended to be a humorous moment, with Bender suggesting that the tent be knocked over, and Josh Holloway adding Sawyer trying to escape but being pulled back. The scene in which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are occurring in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing the location of the basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff.

After college, Bell and Abercrombie, who at the time was attending college at the University of Tennessee at Martin, reunited with Abbott and formed the band Reel Too Real, playing cover songs at local clubs in Tennessee and eventually becoming a national touring club circuit band. Bassist Jeff Abercrombie saw vocalist-guitarist Brett Scallions performing in a bar in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1992 and later recruited him to join in early 1993. Keyboardist Erik Avakian joined the group in 1995. During this time, Carl played guitar and provided backing vocals, Jeff played bass, Jody was on drums, Brett played guitar and sang lead vocals, and Erik played keyboards and shared singing duties on various songs. That same year, the band moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they performed at local Pennsylvania bars & nightclubs under the name Reel Too Real, playing cover songs. The band made a choice to perform under a different name when showcasing its own original material. That name, for the time being, would be Small the Joy, which produced one self-released EP, a self-titled cassette tape, in 1994. The band then once again decided to change its name, this time settling on the name Fuel, before self-releasing their second EP, Porcelain, in 1996 as well as repackaging their first EP, Small the Joy, with the \"Fuel\" name on it. There were several names on a shortlist, but in the end, Fuel was the name everyone agreed on. Erik played keyboards and sang backing vocals on both EPs before leaving the band in 1996. Porcelain sold well locally, spawning a small local radio hit with \"Shimmer\" even before being signed to a major label. The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of Sony's 550 imprint, which released their third EP, Hazleton, the following year, 1998. Mainstream success Upon signing to Epic, the band entered Longview Farm recording studios in Massachusetts, along with producer Steven Haigler and session drummer Jonathan Mover due to problems with Abbott. The band's full-length debut, Sunburn, came out in 1998. \"Shimmer\" was again included and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts, No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, No. 37 on the Adult Top 40 chart and at No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the other singles received some airplay. The songs \"Shimmer\" and \"Sunburn\" are also featured on the charitable album Live in the X Lounge. \"Sunburn\" was also featured in the movie Scream 3, and the band contributed the non-LP track \"Walk the Sky\" to the 1998 American Godzilla film. The band hit the road in support of the release. Once again due to problems with Abbott, Mover was enlisted, this time to play drums on tour while the band sought out a full-time drummer to join. Kevin Miller joined the band as the drummer, coming from the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania-based bar band The Armadillos. Liner notes for the cassette and CD issues of \"Sunburn\" list the band members as Carl Bell , Brett Scallions , Jeff Abercrombie , and Kevin Miller , although Jonathan Mover is credited with playing all the drums and percussion on the record. The band picture includes Miller, though he did not play on the record. The album Sunburn was the band's first Gold and Platinum selling record. In 2000, Fuel returned with their second album, Something Like Human, featuring the single \"Hemorrhage \" which was No. 1 for 12 weeks on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart. The single was also named Billboards No. 5 Rock Song of the Decade according to their Best of the 2000s Rock Songs chart. In 2013 \"Hemorrhage \" became the No. 6 Alternative Rock song of the past 25 years according to Billboards Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs. Something Like Human peaked at No.\u00a017 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA on September 25, 2001. The group's third album, Natural Selection, named after Darwinian theory, was released in September 2003 and debuted at No. 15 on the U.S. Billboard charts. The extended lag time between Something Like Human and Natural Selection was due to legal problems and lead singer Scallions having to recover from surgery to repair a deviated septum he suffered from an on-stage collision with Bell. The album spawned the hit \"Falls on Me\", which hit No. 9 and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and the Modern Rock Tracks charts, and reaching No. 13 and No. 17 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, peaking at No.\u00a052 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004 for best engineered album, and the band contributed the song \"Won't Back Down\" to the Daredevil soundtrack earlier in the year. They released their greatest hits album The Best of Fuel on December 13, 2005. Their song \"Quarter\" was featured in the games Need for Speed: Underground, NFL Street, and NASCAR Thunder 2004. Line-up changes and Angels & Devils After disagreements , drummer Kevin Miller was dismissed from the band in 2004. On February 7, 2006, Fuel announced through their website singer Brett Scallions had left the band. Fuel had already laid the instrumental tracks for their fourth album and soon began auditioning singers so the band could move forward. Abercrombie and Bell took notice of American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry, after he performed \"Hemorrhage \" on the show. The single achieved the iTunes Top 10 download list, remaining a number of days and sparking interest in other Fuel songs, which began to appear in the iTunes Top 100 download chart. On March 3, 2006, American Idol judge, Randy Jackson, stated in an interview Daughtry had been offered the opportunity to become Fuel's new lead singer. Fuel confirmed their interest on their official website as well as interviews appearing on CNN Entertainment Tonight. On May 11, 2006, Abercrombie and Bell appeared on the TV show Extra to officially offer Daughtry the job. However, though flattered, Daughtry turned down this offer. By this time also, Tommy Stewart, formerly of Godsmack, was named on Fuel's Myspace page as Fuel's drummer. On June 8, 2006, Bell announced the band had found a new lead singer but was awaiting confirmation from the record label to announce it. Still, they officially entered the studio in mid-August with producer Scott Humphrey to start recording their fourth album. Due to other commitments Stewart was not available to play drums on the album, so Tommy Lee and Josh Freese performed drums in his place. The band posted photos from the studio fairly often on the band's website and MySpace. On March 9, 2007, Carl Bell officially announced Fuel's next album, complete with new band members, was fully mixed and going to mastering, and on April 19, 2007, he posted on Fuel's official website their new lead singer was Toryn Green. On May 15, 2007, Bell announced the title of the new album\u2014Angels & Devils. On June 19, 2007, Fuel's first single from their new album, \"Wasted Time\", was released into rock radio and internet download, peaking at No. 24 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. The album was released on August 7, 2007. A second single, \"Gone\", was released on October 23. Angels & Devils debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 42, selling roughly 15,000 copies in its first week. On October 20, 2008, Sony's catalog division Legacy Recordings released the album Playlist: The Very Best of Fuel on their Playlist series. The return of Brett Scallions and Puppet Strings On April 8, 2010, the reformation of Fuel was confirmed in an official press release. The band consisted of Scallions with an entirely new lineup. \"There is only one original of anything,\" says Scallions, \"and that includes Fuel. The original lineup with Carl, Jeff, Jody, and myself will always be something special to all of us, and our first Fuelies but it has been thirteen years since the original lineup was intact, and since then many great musicians have come and gone. The lineup I put together for Fuel is not meant to replace or diminish what any of the original members created. Just the opposite, it is to give our fans a live destination and to keep the Fuel name alive for a new generation to discover. Maybe someday we'll all get on the same page and play together again, but life happens, and the next thing you know you just can't jump on a bus and take off for a month, let alone a year.\" It was later announced on June 25, 2010, former Shinedown guitarist Jasin Todd had joined the band to replace Yogi Lonich on lead guitar. Lonich returned to the band in January 2011. Todd left the band on good terms. In March 2011, Brett Scallions started a new band called World Fire Brigade. The group was a writing team of Brett Scallions, Eddie Wohl, and Smile Empty Soul's Sean Danielsen. Scallions and Danielsen shared vocal duties, Danielsen played guitar parts, Scallions played bass, and Ken Schalk performed all drum tracks. Guest guitar solos were contributed by Rob Caggiano of Volbeat, Andy Andersson who played with Scallions in Fuel during the Puppet Strings era, and Mike McCready of Pearl Jam. The re-formed Fuel performed at The Bamboozle in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on May 1, 2011. The band played Bethlehem Musikfest alongside Buckcherry, however, Yogi Lonich was not on stage. A friend of Scallions, Martin Estrada, filled in for the show. Brett Scallions announced on his official Facebook page that Yogi Lonich and Scallions were parting ways amicably and it was best for Fuel to search for a replacement. Scallions also hinted there to be new music in the works and also introduced the band's new lead guitarist, Andy Andersson. The band continued its tour and played new material during their shows. Fuel entered the studio on March 8, 2012, to record their fifth full-length studio album, Puppet Strings. Eddie Wohl, co-producer of the World Fire Brigade album alongside Scallions and Danielsen, co-produced the new Fuel album with Scallions. In late September, the band re-entered the studio to complete the guitar and bass tracks for the record. As of February 2013, the band was still in the studio finishing vocal & guitar tracks. Originally planned for a 2012 release, the album had been pushed back to a possible mid-2013 release. This marked six years since the band released their previous album Angels & Devils. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the Billboard Rock charts, marking the band's first number one since Something Like Human. On April 30, 2013, drummer Ken Schalk announced his departure from the band to spend more time with his family. On that same day, Scallions announced new drummer Bryan \"Keelgood\" Keeling. The band, however, kept Schalk's drum tracks, as referenced by Keeling in his first interview since joining the band. On April 30, 2013, Brett Scallions announced a new Fuel single was targeted for a mid-summer release via download once the \"details have been worked out and handshakes have been made\". On June 26, 2013, Scallions announced that Bryan Keeling was going out on tour with Eric Sardinas in Europe and that Shannon Boone had joined the band. Scallions also commented on the new album; \"The record has been recorded and is so close to being released for all of you I can taste it. There will be big announcements very soon regarding release dates, singles, videos, and much much more. Take care and we will see you all soon at a venue near you!\" Scallions confirmed the new album was mixed by Ben Grosse who also collaborated with Fuel on Something Like Human. According to Scallions, the new album was currently in the mastering stage of production. It was announced through Guitar World on December 5, 2013, the album indeed titled, Puppet Strings, would be released on March 4, 2014. Puppet Strings debuted at #1 on the rock charts, the band's first number one since Something Like Human. The song, \"Yeah!\", was released for free download on the website as well, although it was believed to be the first single, Scallions stated it is not the first single but rather a \"teaser\". The first single, \"Soul to Preach To\" was released in late January 2014. In May 2015, as Fuel geared up to join Everclear on their Summerland Tour, ex-Filter bass player Phil Buckman temporarily replaced Brad Stewart, with Stewart himself filling in for the band Saliva. Although Brad stated he was scheduled to re-join Fuel on June 9, the temporary switch proved to be permanent with Stewart continuing his new role in Saliva, as did Buckman with Fuel. Scallions made many posts on Facebook and Instagram of him working in the studio on new material. It was later announced it was to be released as solo material. The band toured the US in August and September 2017 and toured Australia and New Zealand in December 2017. Fuel toured throughout 2018, playing Sunburn in its entirety to commemorate its 20th anniversary. On October 21, 2020, Scallions officially announced his departure from Fuel in a Facebook post : Bell's return and new record Anomaly Sometime in 2020, founding member and primary songwriter Carl Bell decided to return to the band, forming a new version of group. According to Bell, this was more or less a rebirth of Fuel and a new era for the band. Bell reunited with former drummer Kevin Miller to reform the group. Together they recruited a new singer, John Corsale, who at the time was the frontman for Miller's band Smashed. They began rehearsing in summer of 2020, and later began working on what would become Fuel's 6th full-length album. During that time, the band also released Something Like Human on vinyl for the first time. Fuel's newest album, Anomaly, was released on October 22, 2021.  Basically due to travel restrictions from Covid and the inability for the band to get together, Bell wrote all the songs on Anomaly, performed all the instruments on the album, recorded, arranged, produced and mixed the album.  The first single, \"Hard\", was released on July 9. The album's second single, \"Don't Say I\", was released on August 20, 2021. The album's 11 songs were written and performed by Bell with vocals by Corsale. Miller, along with new members Mark Klotz and Tommy Nat do not perform on the album but are featured in the videos and live performances. The cover art and track listing was revealed on August 28. Since the album's release, the band has been performing various shows live in the US, and has more shows and some major festival dates scheduled for 2022.  Scheduled 2022 festivals include dates with KISS, Five Finger Death Punch, Papa Roach, Seether, Bush, Puddle of Mud, Mammoth WVH, Bad Wolves and many others.  The band is also scheduled to release new material in addition to the Anomaly release.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter in his directorial debut, and executive produced by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton. The film centers on two monsters James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc., which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when a little human girl sneaks into the factory, she must be returned home before it's too late. Docter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon and Ralph Eggleston. Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Daniel Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to simulate fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose for its fourth. Upon its release on November 2, 2001, Monsters, Inc. received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, grossing over $577\u00a0million worldwide to become the third highest-grossing film of 2001. The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"If I Didn't Have You\" and was nominated for the first Best Animated Feature, but lost to DreamWorks' Shrek, and was also nominated for Best Original Score and Best Sound Editing.

It was written by series co-creator Brad Falchuk, who deemed the episode potentially the best of the series so far. \"Home\" sees the return of guest star Kristin Chenoweth, who first appeared in episode five, \"The Rhodes Not Taken\", as former glee club member April Rhodes. Prior to her first appearance, Chenoweth was already acquainted with Glee creator Ryan Murphy, having appeared in his 2006 film Running with Scissors. Murphy commented that he loves writing for Chenoweth, and both he and Chenoweth expressed their desire for April to return to Glee in the future, with Chenoweth stating: \"This part is like nothing I've had the chance to do on TV.\" It was confirmed in October 2009 that Chenoweth would reprise the role of April later in the first season, and on March 14, 2010 that her return would occur in \"Home\". While Glee also features Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers declined to give the two scenes together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond \"Home\", Falchuk commented that the producers want to \"have her around as much as possible\", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: \"[When] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back. The one advantage we have, I think, is that we have so many incredibly talented people in our \u2026 cast that \u2026 we don't need [guest actors] as much. But there are certain very special people that, of course, you'd always be interested in.\" The episode features a cover version of \"A House Is Not a Home\", performed by Colfer and Monteith, as well as a mash-up of \"A House Is Not a Home\" and \"One Less Bell to Answer\", performed by Chenoweth and Morrison. Morrison and Chenoweth also duet on The Pointer Sisters' version of \"Fire\". In keeping with the \"home\" theme of the episode, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's ballad \"Home Sweet Home\" can be heard in the roller rink scene, but was not covered by the cast. Chenoweth performs \"Home\" from The Wiz, and Riley sings \"Beautiful\" by Christina Aguilera. The songs performed were all released as singles, available for digital download.

It was written by Clarkson along with its producers David Hodges and Ben Moody, both from Evanescence. It was released on August 16, 2005, by RCA Records, as the third single from Breakaway. Clarkson originally wrote \"Because of You\" when she was 16 years old to cope with the emotional distress caused by her parents' divorce. She wanted the song to be included on her debut studio album, Thankful , but her record label rejected the song. She then polished the song with Hodges and Moody before successfully convincing her label to include it on Breakaway.

For years, Carey's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads, devoid of any guest appearances or hip hop-influenced melodies. In January 1995, as she recorded Daydream, Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences. She enlisted the production skills and rap styles of Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was featured on the remix of her song \"Fantasy.\" While Mottola was hesitant at first, Carey's persistence paid off when the song became an international chart topper, with critics calling the collaboration one of the pioneering songs of pop and R&B musical collaborations. During the recording and production of Carey's Butterfly in 1997, she and Mottola separated, giving Carey an extended amount of control over the unfinished album. Following their separation, Carey began working with younger hip hop and R&B producers and songwriters, aside from her usual work with balladeers Walter Afanasieff and Kenneth Edmonds. While the album incorporated several different genres and components that were not present in Carey's previous releases, Butterfly also included a balance of her classic ballads and newer R&B-infused jams. While Sony accepted Carey's new collaborations with writers and producers such as P. Diddy and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, they continued to focus their promotion on the ballads. After \"Honey,\" the debut single from Butterfly, was released in August 1997, Sony halted the release of the succeeding R&B-influenced jams, and released the ballad \"My All\" as the second worldwide single.

The album features several guest vocalists, including rappers Drake, Nicki Minaj and Eminem, who is featured on the sequel to \"Love the Way You Lie\", titled \"Love the Way You Lie \". A dance-pop and R&B album, Loud differs from Rihanna's previous record, Rated R , which incorporates a prominently foreboding and angry tone and dark themes. Loud features up-tempo songs, and marks the return to dancehall; a genre prominent on her first two albums Music of the Sun and A Girl like Me .

Loud received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its upbeat material and Rihanna's vocal performances, while others stated that although the songs were solid, they were unfocused to each other. The album was a commercial success; it debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart, with sales of 207,000 copies, the highest first-week sales of her career at the time.

This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased . In the story, the Doctor encounters both the Master and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series. Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by \"Time Crash\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor Peter Davison. A set of two mini-episodes, titled \"Space\" and \"Time\" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event.

In Suspect, she played a public defender who is both helped and romanced by one of the jurors in the homicide case she is handling. Alongside Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, she starred as one of three divorcees involved with a mysterious and wealthy visitor from hell who comes to a small New England town in the comedy horror The Witches of Eastwick. In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow in love with her fianc\u00e9's younger brother. The two last films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively.The New York Times Janet Maslin wrote Moonstruck \"offers further proof that Cher has evolved into the kind of larger-than-life movie star who's worth watching whatever she does.\" For that film, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had become one of the most bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1\u00a0million per film. That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15\u00a0million in its first year sales. In 1987, Cher signed with Geffen Records and revived her musical career with what music critics Johnny Danza and Dean Ferguson describe as \"her most impressive string of hits to date\", establishing her as a \"serious rock and roller\u00a0... a crown that she'd worked long and hard to capture\". Michael Bolton, Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child, and Richie Sambora produced her first Geffen album, Cher. Despite facing strong retail and radio airplay resistance upon its release, the album proved to be a commercial success, certified platinum by the RIAA. Cher features the rock ballad \"I Found Someone\", Cher's first US top-ten single in more than eight years. By the end of the 1980s, Cher was also receiving attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men. She had romantic relationships with actors Val Kilmer, Eric Stoltz, and Tom Cruise, hockey player Ron Duguay, film producer Josh Donen, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, and Rob Camilletti, a bagel baker 18-years her junior whom she dated from 1986 to 1989. Cher's 19th studio album Heart of Stone was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The music video for its second single, \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", caused controversy due to Cher's performance on the battleship , straddling a cannon, and wearing a leather thong that revealed her tattooed buttocks. The song topped the Australian charts for seven weeks, reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became one of Cher's most successful singles. Other songs from Heart of Stone to reach the US top ten were \"After All\", a duet with Peter Cetera, and \"Just Like Jesse James\". At the 1989 People's Choice Awards, Cher won the Favorite All-Around Female Star Award. She embarked on the Heart of Stone Tour in 1989. Most critics liked the tour's nostalgic nature and admired Cher's showmanship. Its parent television special Cher at the Mirage was filmed during a concert in Las Vegas. In her first film in three years, Mermaids , Cher paid tribute to her own mother in this story about a woman who moves her two daughters from town to town at the end of a love affair. She clashed with the film's first two directors, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and Frank Oz, who were replaced by Richard Benjamin. Believing Cher would be the star attraction, the producers allowed her creative control for the film. Mermaids was a box office success and received generally positive reviews. One of the two songs Cher recorded for the film's soundtrack, a cover version of Betty Everett's \"The Shoop Shoop Song \", topped the UK Singles Chart for five weeks. Cher's final studio album for Geffen Records, Love Hurts , stayed at number one in the UK for six weeks and produced the UK top-ten single \"Love and Understanding\". The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label \"hit years\" had been especially significant to her, \"because I was getting to do songs that I really loved\u00a0... songs that really represented me, and they were popular!\" She released the exercise book Forever Fit in 1991, followed by the 1992 fitness videos CherFitness: A New Attitude and CherFitness: Body Confidence.

The Byrds' single reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was also the lead single from the band's 1968 country rock album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. Although it is not as famous as their cover version of Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", the Byrds' recording of \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" is sometimes considered by critics to be the band's best Dylan cover.  Billboard described it as having \"infectious rhythm material and good lyric line, well performed\". The song was selected as a suitable cover by the Byrds after their record label, Columbia Records , sent them some demos from Dylan's Woodstock sessions.  Included among these demos were the songs \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" and \"Nothing Was Delivered\", both of which were recorded by the Byrds in March 1968, during the Nashville recording sessions for Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The Byrds' version of \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" features musical contributions from session musician Lloyd Green on pedal steel guitar. Author Johnny Rogan has commented that despite the change in musical style that the country-influenced Sweetheart of the Rodeo album represented for the band, the inclusion of two Dylan covers forged a link with their previous folk rock incarnation, when Dylan's material had been a mainstay of their repertoire. The Byrds' recording of \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" caused a minor controversy between the band and its author. Dylan's original demo of the song contained the lyric, \"Pick up your money, pack up your tent\", which was mistakenly altered in the Byrds' version, by guitarist and singer Roger McGuinn, to \"Pack up your money, pick up your tent\". Dylan expressed mock-annoyance at this lyric change in his 1971 recording of the song, singing \"Pack up your money, put up your tent, McGuinn/You ain't goin' nowhere.\" McGuinn replied in 1989 on a new recording of the song included on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two album, adding the word \"Dylan\" after the same \"Pack up your money, pick up your tent\" lyric. Following its appearance on Sweetheart of the Rodeo, \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" would go on to become a staple of the Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973.  The Byrds re-recorded \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" in 1971 with Earl Scruggs, as part of the Earl Scruggs, His Family and Friends television special, and this version was included on the program's accompanying soundtrack album. The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of the Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989.  McGuinn continues to perform the song in his solo concerts and consequently it appears on his 2007 album, Live from Spain. In addition to its appearance on the Sweetheart of the Rodeo album, the Byrds' original recording of \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" also appears on several of the band's compilations, including The Best of The Byrds: Greatest Hits, Volume II, History of The Byrds, The Byrds Play Dylan, The Original Singles: 1967\u20131969, Volume 2, The Byrds, and There Is a Season.

He changed his style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioned his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest of his fingers outstretched for balance. The Who's studio recordings seldom did justice to Entwistle's playing, in part because he was better heard in concert, where he and Pete Townshend frequently exchanged roles, with Entwistle providing rapid melodic lines and Townshend anchoring the song with rhythmic chord work. At the same time, Townshend noted that Entwistle provided the true rhythmic timekeeping in the band, while Keith Moon, with his flourishes around the kit, was more like a keyboard player. In 1989, Entwistle pointed out that, by modern standards, \"the Who haven't got a proper bass player.\" Entwistle also developed what he called a \"typewriter\" approach to playing the bass. It involved positioning his right hand over the strings so all four fingers could be used to tap percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a distinctive twangy sound. This gave him the ability to play three or four strings at once, or to use several fingers on a single string. It allowed him to create passages that were both percussive and melodic. This method should not be confused with tapping or slapping, and in fact predates these techniques. Modern players such as Ryan Martinie of heavy metal band Mudvayne have used similar techniques. Entwistle can be seen using this technique in Mike Gordon's 2002 film, Rising Low. Notable in his left-hand technique was his use of slides, positioning his left hand for octaves, and his use of the pentatonic when playing with the Who. Entwistle was notorious for the extremely high volume at which he played bass, going so far as to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on lip reading to understand speech in his later years. Randy Bachman of Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling the rush of air from his giant amp stacks.

Scenes were filmed in SoHo, Manhattan, between 2008 and 2009 with Peter Deming as the director of photography. The soundtrack was composed by Clint Mansell, who received a World Soundtrack Award for Soundtrack Composer of the Year for his work. Miramax Films initially bought Last Night for a March 19, 2010 release, but it was delayed by the company's sale to Filmyard Holdings. The film was shown at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2010 Rome Film Festival. It premiered theatrically in France on February 16, 2011, and had a limited release in the United States on May 6, 2011. It was released through video on demand. Critics were divided over the film's plot and its commentary on infidelity; Deming's cinematography and performances from Knightley, Canet, and Mendes received praise while Worthington and the scenes between Michael and Laura were the subject of criticism. Last Night grossed $7.7 million primarily from foreign markets.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Worse than the teasing in the playground, though, is the unpredictable criticism from her father, Gerry Cookson. She is frequently berated for breaking any of his house rules, as well as for her lack of looks and confidence, even though she is a wealthy girl who lives in a large, beautifully decorated house and attends a private school. Her only source of kindness at home is her mother, Dilys \"Dilly\" Cookson. Beauty adores rabbits, although Gerry forbids her from having pets. Her favorite television show is \"Rabbit Hutch\", a show for young children about a man, Sam, and his pet rabbit, Lily. Beauty has no friends at all at school. The only student that is nice to her is Rhona, Skye's best friend. However, Rhona desperately wants to be friends with Beauty, which she reveals one day when Skye is at a dentist appointment. Finally, Beauty is invited to a birthday party Rhona is holding. For the birthday party, Gerry forces her to get corkscrew curls, and popular bullies Skye, Arabella and Emily develop a new nickname for her: Ugly Corkscrew. Beauty tells her mother about the teasing and Dilly decides to learn how to bake cookies, even though she is an awful cook, in the hope that Beauty will be given a new nickname, Cookie . Gradually, both Beauty and Dilly get the hang of making cookies and become wondrous at it. Gerry refuses to acknowledge any of this completely doubting Dilly's ability to cook anything at all. Beauty's birthday is approaching and she is dreading it, however Gerry appears to turn over a new leaf and act like an ideal father. Gerry arranges a birthday feast and organizes tickets for all of the girls in her class to see a stage show called 'Birthday Bonanza', with a chauffeur driven limousine to escort them there. Her mother buys a beautiful Victorian-style dress for her, and Beauty invites all the girls, including Skye, and Dilly decides to give out cookies at the end of the party, which Gerry spitefully crushes into crumbs. Rhona gives Beauty a pet rabbit, which she names 'Birthday'. The party soon becomes miserable when, at the show, Beauty feels too shy to go onstage , and Gerry shouts at her in the limousine after all the girls leave. When Dilly and Beauty learn that Birthday has been killed by a fox after Gerry deliberately let him out of his hutch, Dilly decides to separate from him, and she and Beauty pack their things and leave the house. The two drive to Gerry's first wife, Avril, who treats the two kindly but at first looks down upon Dilly's decision to leave Gerry, saying that she has \"deliberately made herself homeless\". She lets them stay for the night until they decide to go on holiday. The holiday resort to which they go is called Rabbit Cove, which Beauty chooses due to her love of rabbits. They find their way to an idyllic seaside resort run by a kind older man named Mike, a painter who takes Dilly on as a breakfast chef in his B&B. Dilly decides to let Gerry know where they are, despite Beauty's objections, but after he shouts at her and calls her a \"useless aging dumb blonde\" she terminates the call. Gerry tracks them down, and yells at them in front of the customers at the caf\u00e9, even going as far as to accuse Dilly of having an affair with Mike and then to punch him in the nose, before driving off. Even though Dilly is living with Mike and he hints that he wants to start dating, Dilly refuses for the time being, as she wants to be independent. He understands. Just before summer, Beauty is sent to a new school which she is adamant about at first until she agrees. At the school she makes friends and is nicknamed the Cookie Girl, but she still keeps in touch with Rhona by writing letters. Beauty is asked to go on 'Watchbox', a talent show that Skye really wanted to be on, due to the rise in popularity of her mother's cookies. As a treat, the producers of Watchbox invite Sam, who tells Beauty that his rabbit, Lily, is pregnant. Sam decides to give Beauty her own baby rabbit.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It featured thicker sounds, layered saxophones, and vocal textures. It spawned the hit singles \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" , their fourth UK No. 1 , \"Invisible Sun\", and \"Spirits in the Material World\". As the band was unable to agree on a cover picture, the album cover had three red pictographs, digital likenesses of the three band members in the style of segmented LED displays, set against a black background. In the 1980s, Sting and Summers became tax exiles and moved to Ireland while Copeland, an American, remained in England. The group opened and closed the 1981 concert film, Urgh! A Music War. The film, which captured the music scene in the wake of punk, was masterminded by Stewart Copeland's brothers Ian and Miles. The film had a limited release but developed a mythic reputation over the years. At the 1982 Brit Awards in London, the Police received the award for Best British Group. After the Ghost in the Machine Tour concluded in 1982, the group took a sabbatical and each member pursued outside projects. By this time, Sting was becoming a major star, and he established a career beyond the Police by branching out into acting. Back in 1979, he had made a well-received debut as the \"Ace Face\" in the British drama film Quadrophenia, a film loosely based on The Who's rock opera, followed by a role as a mechanic in love with Eddie Cochran's music in Chris Petit's Radio On. In 1982, Sting furthered his acting career by co-starring in the Richard Loncraine film Brimstone and Treacle. He also had a minor solo hit in the United Kingdom with the movie's theme song, a cover of the 1929 hit \"Spread a Little Happiness\" . Over 1981 and 1982, Summers recorded his first album with Robert Fripp, I Advance Masked. In 1983, Stewart Copeland composed the musical score for Francis Ford Coppola's film Rumble Fish. The single \"Don't Box Me In \", a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter Stan Ridgway received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. Also in 1983, Sting filmed his first big-budget movie role-playing Feyd-Rautha in David Lynch's Dune. As Sting's fame rose, his relationship with Stewart Copeland deteriorated. Their increasingly strained partnership was further stretched by the pressures of worldwide publicity and fame, conflicting egos, and their financial success.

As the band tried to lean towards a more hard rock sound, they felt that Johns was overemphasizing their country-influenced rock sound. Johns however felt that the Eagles were not capable of what the band wanted and told the band: \"You are not a rock-and-roll band, The Who is a rock-and-roll band, and you're not that.\"  The band\u2014Glenn Frey in particular, but not Don Henley\u2014were also unhappy with the no-drug policy of Johns during the recording; furthermore they did not feel at home recording in London. The band was concerned about the lack of success of the previous album Desperado, and were more assertive in wanting more input into the album, which Johns was unwilling to allow. The Eagles spent six weeks recording in London, with both the band and the producer becoming frustrated with each other and frequent arguments between Johns and Frey. The band then took a break, decided to find a new producer and discarded all the recordings except for two usable tracks, \"Best of My Love\" and \"You Never Cry Like a Lover\". The band relocated back to California and hired Bill Szymczyk, who had produced The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get by Joe Walsh\u2014who was also managed by their manager Irving Azoff and who would go on to join the Eagles in late 1975\u2014that interested the band. The band recorded the rest of the album at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. They were allowed more input in how the album was made and enjoyed more freedom with Szymczyk in the making of the album. Szymczyk suggested they bring in a harder-edged guitarist to add slide guitar to the song \"Good Day in Hell\". Bernie Leadon suggested his old friend Don Felder, whom they had met and jammed with on a few occasions. The band was so impressed that they invited Felder to become the fifth Eagle. The only other track on this album on which he appeared was \"Already Gone\". They credited him as a late arrival on the album's liner notes. On the difference in sound between Johns' and Szymczyk's productions, Henley said: \"There\u2019s a lot less echo with Bill, for one thing. There\u2019s more of a raw and funky presence. Glyn had a stamp he put on his records which is a deep echo that is really smooth like ice cream\". He thought that the production on the two songs that Johns produced was good and necessary. Frey, however, found that L.A. country-rock records were \"all too smooth and glassy\", and wanted a \"tougher sound\". Their friend and collaborator J. D. Souther ascribed the change of producer to \"Eagles\u2019 desire to get more of a live, thin sound on the albums\". The first two singles released were more rock-oriented; Frey was reluctant to release the Johns-produced \"Best of My Love\" as a single, and held off its release for some months. However, when it was finally released, the label had truncated the song\u2013without the band's knowledge or approval\u2013so that it would be more radio-friendly. \"Best of My Love\" would become their biggest hit thus far, and their first No. 1 on the charts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film's female leads were played by Cathy Moriarty, who had made her film debut in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull , and Kathryn Walker, who had been the girlfriend of Belushi's National Lampoon colleague Douglas Kenney . The production of Neighbors was troubled. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd switched their roles in pre-production, acting against type . Belushi and Aykroyd also argued constantly with director John G. Avildsen , and lobbied to have him removed from the picture. Belushi wanted either Aykroyd, himself or John Landis to direct the film. Avildsen also argued with producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, and screenwriter Larry Gelbart objected to the changes made to his screenplay by Dan Aykroyd. John Belushi's drug problems also impaired the film's production, and Neighbors proved to be Belushi's final film before he died of a drug overdose. Tom Scott was originally assigned to compose the score for Neighbors but was replaced by Avildsen's frequent collaborator Bill Conti. John Belushi unsuccessfully tried to have the film finish with a song written and performed by the punk rock group Fear . Music producing partners Steve Cropper and Bruce Robb remember recording the band's music, but nobody knows exactly what happened with the final soundtrack which was ultimately replaced in the film by Conti's more traditional movie score. \"How can I describe what it was like recording in the early days of punk?\" said music producer and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb. \"We had decided to track the song selection in order, and were on track 4 before the band realized they were all using different set lists.

He had a pacemaker implanted in November 2000 and he underwent open-heart surgery in January 2001. After suffering a series of strokes and congestive heart failure, he died of cardiac arrest at the age of 83 on July 5, 2002, at Citrus Memorial Hospital, Inverness, Florida, near his home in Citrus Hills, Florida. Though his will stated his desire to be cremated and his ashes scattered in the Florida Keys, Williams's son John-Henry and younger daughter Claudia chose to have his remains frozen cryonically. Ted's elder daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, brought a suit to have her father's wishes recognized. John-Henry's lawyer then produced an informal \"family pact\" signed by Ted, Claudia, and John-Henry, in which they agreed \"to be put into biostasis after we die\" to \"be able to be together in the future, even if it is only a chance.\" Bobby-Jo and her attorney, Spike Fitzpatrick , contended that the family pact, which was scribbled on an ink-stained napkin, was forged by John-Henry and/or Claudia. Fitzpatrick and Ferrell believed that the signature was not obtained legally. Laboratory analysis proved that the signature was genuine. John-Henry said that his father was a believer in science and was willing to try cryonics if it held the possibility of reuniting the family. Though the family pact upset some friends, family and fans, a public plea for financial support of the lawsuit by Ferrell produced little result. Citing financial difficulties, Ferrell dropped her lawsuit on the condition that a $645,000 trust fund left by Williams would immediately pay the sum out equally to the three children. Inquiries to cryonics organizations increased after the publicity from the case. In Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero, author Leigh Montville claims that the family cryonics pact was a practice Ted Williams autograph on a plain piece of paper, around which the agreement had later been hand written. The pact document was signed \"Ted Williams\", the same as his autographs, whereas he would always sign his legal documents \"Theodore Williams\", according to Montville.

It stars the voices of Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, and E.G. Daily. An international co-production between the United States and Australia, the film was produced at Sydney-based visual effects and animation studio Animal Logic for Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures, and Kingdom Feature Productions, and was released in North America theaters on November 17, 2006 and in Australia theaters on December 26, 2006. It is the first animated film produced by Kennedy Miller and Animal Logic. Set in the cold land of Antarctica, the film follows on Mumble, an emperor penguin who, despite his lacking the ability to sing the heartsong to attract a soul mate, is able to tap dance brilliantly. After being exiled from Emperor Land by Noah the Elder, Mumble befriends the Amigos, who help him rediscover himself. Though primarily an animated film, the film does incorporate motion capture of live action humans in certain scenes. The film was simultaneously released in both conventional theatres and in IMAX 2D format. The studio had hinted that a future IMAX 3D release was a possibility. However, Warner Bros., the film's production company, was on too tight a budget to release Happy Feet in IMAX digital 3D. Happy Feet received generally positive reviews from critics, becoming the recipient of the inaugural BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, and the fourth non-Disney or Pixar film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was nominated for the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film, both losing to Cars.

Similarly, Cook's clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals.

The album was the band's second collaboration with producer Rick Rubin, whose production skills on their previous album Reign in Blood had helped their sound evolve. Given the frenetic pace of Reign in Blood, Slayer wisely made no attempt to top it on South of Heaven; rather, the band offset and complemented Reign in Blood by deliberately slowing the tempo down on South of Heaven, as well as by utilizing undistorted guitars and toned-down vocals. South of Heaven was the band's last album released by Def Jam, although the rights were transferred to Rubin's new label Def American Recordings after Rubin ended his partnership with Russell Simmons. The album was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by Geffen Records through Warner Bros., as Def Jam's then-distributor Columbia refused to release work by the band. South of Heaven became Slayer's second album to enter the Billboard 200, peaking at number 57. While some critics praised the change in the band's sound, others more accustomed to the style of their earlier efforts were disappointed.

Henri Langlois screened the studio version of Greed for von Stroheim in 1950. Von Stroheim said, \"It was for me an exhumation. It was like opening a coffin in which there was just dust, giving off a terrible stench, a couple of vertebra and a piece of shoulder bone.\" He went on to say that \"It was as if a man's beloved was run over by a truck, maimed beyond recognition. He goes to see her in the morgue. Of course, he still loves her but it's only the memory of her that he can love\u2014because he doesn't recognize her anymore.\" In the early 1950s Greeds reputation began to grow and it appeared on several lists of the greatest films ever made. In 1952 at the Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux Arts de Belgique, Greed was named the fifth greatest film ever made, with such directors as Luchino Visconti, Orson Welles, Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Billy Wilder voting for it. Later in 1952 Sight and Sound magazine published its first list of the \"ten greatest films ever made\". Greed was tied for 7th place on that list, with such critics as Andre Bazin, Lotte Eisner, Curtis Harrington, Penelope Houston and Gavin Lambert voting for it. In 1962 it was tied for 4th on the same list. Since 1972 it has failed to reach a spot on the top ten. The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que royale de Belgique released a list of \"the most important and misappreciated American films of all time\" in 1978. Greed was third on its list after Citizen Kane and Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. In a University of Southern California list of the \"50 Most Significant American Films\" made by the school's Performing Arts Council, Greed was listed as number 21. In 1991 Greed was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Among those who have praised Greed over the years are Sergei Eisenstein; Joseph von Sternberg, who said, \"We were all influenced by Greed\"; Jean Renoir, who called it \"the film of films\"; and Ernst Lubitsch, who called von Stroheim \"the only true 'novelist'\" in films. More recently Guillermo del Toro called it \"a perfect reflection of the anxiety permeating the passage into the 20th century and the absolute dehumanization that was to come\", and Norbert Pfaffenbichler said that \"the last shot of the movie is unforgettable.\" American writer, filmmaker, philosopher and political activist, Susan Sontag named Greed as one of her favorite films. Jonathan Rosenbaum has stated that Greed was a major influence on the style and content of many films. Stroheim's shots filming the sun predated Akira Kurosawa's better-known uses of the technique in Rashomon . Rosenbaum compared specific shot set-ups in Greed to shots in King Vidor's The Crowd, Jean Renoir's Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, Orson Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons, Howard Hawks' To Have and Have Not and Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura. In addition, he likened certain plot elements or characters in Greed to John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window , Claude Chabrol's Les Bonnes Femmes and Elaine May's Mikey and Nicky . Rosenbaum singled out Stroheim's influence on May, an American director, with Mikey and Nicky centering on the disintegration of a friendship over money and sex, and including grotesque elements and characters caught between innocence and corruption. Rosenbaum also asserts that Orson Welles's use of satirical caricatures in all of his films is in \"the spirit of von Stroheim\". The two films most commonly compared to Greed are Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being lost in the desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. The Magnificent Ambersons and Greed both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that Greed influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to the intentions of the original novels. In the first chapter of the 1966 serial film Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates, the uncut version of Greed is used as a plot device. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague. Attempts to reconstruct the uncut version of Greed without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que royale de Belgique named Greed as one of the twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for Greed, which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order to reconstruct the original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos to reconstruct the uncut version of Greed, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available. In 1999, Turner Entertainment decided to recreate, as closely as possible, the original version by combining the existing footage with over 650 still photographs of the lost scenes , in accordance with an original continuity outline written by von Stroheim. All materials were provided by the Margaret Herrick Library. This restoration runs almost four hours. It was produced by film preservationist Rick Schmidlin and edited by Glenn Morgan. Schmidlin restored many characters and sub-plots from the original version. A new musical score was composed by Robert Israel. The reconstruction cost $100,000 to produce. Schmidlin called the finished product \"a reconstruction of Von Stroheim's lost narrative.\" It premiered at the 1999 Telluride Film Festival and was later screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Pordenone Silent Film Festival before being aired on Turner Classic Movies on December 5, 1999. Film critic Todd McCarthy called the restored version of Greed a triumph. Roger Ebert called Greed a masterpiece and said that the restored Schmidlin cut illustrates the \"prudish sensibilities [that] went into MGM's chop job.\" Rosenbaum praised the project, but claimed it could only be considered a \"study version\". The reconstruction won a special citation from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. In 2020, the film's copyright lapsed, entering into the public domain.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_772", "question": "Who was the producer of The Law of the Land?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_21555", "text": "The earliest Anglo-Saxon law code to survive, which may date from 602 or 603, is that of \u00c6thelberht of Kent, whose reign ended in 616.  In the 670s or 680s, a code was issued in the names of Hlothhere and Eadric of Kent. The next kings to issue laws were Wihtred of Kent and Ine. The dates of Wihtred's and Ine's laws are somewhat uncertain, but there is reason to believe that Wihtred's laws were issued on 6 September 695, while Ine's laws were written in 694 or shortly before.  Ine had recently agreed peaceful terms with Wihtred over compensation for the death of Mul, and there are indications that the two rulers collaborated to some degree in producing their laws.  In addition to the coincidence of timing, there is one clause that appears in almost identical form in both codes. Another sign of collaboration is that Wihtred's laws use gesith, a West Saxon term for noble, in place of the Kentish term eorlcund.  It is possible that Ine and Wihtred issued the law codes as an act of prestige, to re-establish authority after periods of disruption in both kingdoms. Ine's laws survive only because Alfred the Great appended them to his own code of laws.  The oldest surviving manuscript, and only complete copy, is in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge MS 173, which contains both Alfred's and Ine's law codes and the oldest extant text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.  Two more partial texts survive.  One was originally a complete copy of Ine's laws, part of British Library MS Cotton Otho B xi, but that manuscript was largely destroyed in 1731 by a fire at Ashburnham House in which only Chapters 66 to 76.2 of Ine's laws escaped destruction.  A fragment of Ine's laws can also be found in British Museum MS Burney 277. It is possible that we do not have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete. The prologue to Ine's laws lists his advisors.  Three people are named: bishops Eorcenwald and H\u00e6dde, and Ine's father, King Cenred.  Ine was a Christian king, whose intent to encourage Christianity is clear from the laws. The oath of a communicant, for example, is declared to carry more weight than that of a non-Christian; and baptism and religious observance are also addressed. Significant attention is also paid to civil issues\u2014more than in the contemporary Kentish laws. One of the laws states that common land might be enclosed by several ceorls .  Any ceorl who fails to fence his share, however, and allows his cattle to stray into someone else's field is to be held liable for any damage caused. This does not mean that the land was held in common: each ceorl had his own strip of land that supported him. It is notable that a king's law is required to settle a relatively minor issue; the laws do not mention the role of local lords in obtaining compliance from the ceorls. It is clear from this and other laws that tenants held the land in tenure from a lord; the king's close involvement indicates that the relationship between lord and tenant was under the king's control. The laws that deal with straying cattle provide the earliest documentary evidence for an open-field farming system. They show that open-field agriculture was practiced in Wessex in Ine's time, and it is probable that this was also the prevalent agricultural method throughout the English midlands, and as far north and east as Lindsey and Deira. Not all of Wessex used this system, however: it was not used in Devon, for example.  The law which mentions a \"yard\" of land is the first documented mention of that unit. A yard was a unit of land equal to a quarter of a hide; a hide was variable from place to place but could be as much as . The yard in this sense later became the standard holding of the medieval villein, and was known as the virgate.  One historian has commented that \"the beginnings of a manorial economy are clearly visible in Ine's laws.\" The fine for neglecting fyrd, the obligation to do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required to serve in the army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but it is not surprising that all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery. Another law specified that anyone accused of murder required at least one high-ranking person among his \"oath-helpers\". An oath-helper would swear an oath on behalf of an accused man, to clear him from the suspicion of the crime. Ine's requirement implies that he did not trust an oath sworn only by peasants. It may represent a significant change from an earlier time when a man's kin were expected to support him with oaths. The laws made separate provision for Ine's English and British subjects, favouring the former over the latter; the weregilds paid for Britons were half of those paid for Saxons of the same social class, and their oaths also counted for less. The evidence they provide for the incomplete integration of the two populations is supported by research into placename history, the history of religious houses, and local archaeology, which indicates that the western part of Wessex was thinly settled by the Germanic newcomers at the time the laws were issued.

Timbaland was on tour with Justin Timberlake to promote Timberlake's 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds, which Timbaland had also produced. After completing a show in Chicago, they joined Rihanna in the studio, where Timberlake experimented with beats and melodies. Weeks later, the three got together in New York City, where Timberlake had already conceptualized a song for Rihanna. Timbaland, who wanted to compose a song called \"Rehab\" for Rihanna, was producing a beat, when Timberlake came in and improvised the song over it. Hannon Lane co-wrote and co-produced the song, and Demacio Castellon recorded and mixed it in 2007 at Roc The Mic Studios in New York City. Rihanna's stint with Timbaland also resulted in \"Sell Me Candy\" and \"Lemme Get That\", produced for Good Girl Gone Bad. Timberlake told Entertainment Weekly that he believed \"Rehab\" to be \"the bridge for [Rihanna] to be accepted as an adult in the music industry\". Rihanna told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that she enjoyed working with Timberlake, and learned much from the sessions. She said, \"Working with Justin in the studio is just great. He's a fun guy and likes to make all the sessions enjoyable. He's also such a genius when it comes to lyrics.\" \"Rehab\" was the eighth and final single to be released from Rihanna's third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad . According to American music magazine Rap-Up, both \"Breakin' Dishes\" and \"Rehab\" were potential single releases, but \"Rehab\" was chosen. Def Jam Recordings released the song for airplay on contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 6,\u00a02008. On November 3,\u00a02008, it was released to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio stations. The single was released in the UK by Mercury Records on December 8, 2008, as a CD single containing both the album version and an instrumental version of \"Rehab\". On the same date, it was released as a digital download in Ireland. A live performance of the song, recorded in Manchester during Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour , was released for download on the UK and Ireland iTunes Stores. The performance was featured on Rihanna's DVD Good Girl Gone Bad Live. On December 12,\u00a02008, the song and its instrumental version were released on iTunes and 7digital in ten countries, including Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland. In January 2009, it was released as a CD single in Germany, with the same material as in the UK release. In early 2009, Timbaland signed a contract with Verizon Communications, under which he would create music exclusively for BlackBerry Storm mobile phone owners. He was contracted to work with various artists and remix their songs, which would be available for Verizon customers to download at no extra cost. \"Rehab\" was the first song remixed for the project, and this version was released in Canada and the US on May 19, 2009, via iTunes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

There was, however, one element of the film consistently applauded by reviewers: Mae Clarke's performance. Mordaunt Hall, the critic for The New York Times,  did not find sufficient \"wit\" in the light comedy \"to make an audience feel any affection\" for Gilbert's character as \"an intolerable braggart\", adding that \"Mr. Gilbert is no better than the part he plays.\" Hall, on the other hand, reserved his praise for the screenplay's \"designing girl\" Mary, whom he described as \"excellently played by Mae Clarke\". Columnist and reviewer Jimmy Starr, writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, rated the film overall as only \"Fair\" and Gilbert as being \"terribly miscast\". Yet, Starr too judged Clarke's screen appearances as the best parts of the MGM production: \"I find myself liking the performance of Mae Clarke, who stages a grand comeback. She's really a brilliant performer.\" In its assessment of the film, The Washington Post strained in 1933 to avoid bashing Gilbert's performance completely, calling it \"not too terrible\". Nevertheless, the newspaper in its March 11 review expresses a decided dislike for the actor's interpretation of Gunner Smith. \"Gilbert\", The Post reports, \"executes his chore with an unbelievable degree of bland indifference, his man-of-the-world pose too overdrawn for reality.\" Reviews of the \"dramedy\" in leading trade journals and fan magazines in 1933 were largely poor as well. Harrison's Reports, a New York film-review service, found virtually nothing redeeming about the production, deploring its content, overall tone, and pacing. The weekly publication, which promoted itself as \"Free From the Influence of Advertising\", was at that time a popular source of film evaluations for theater operators. As part of its report, Harrison's cautioned operators that Fast Workers was \"Unsuitable for children, adolescents, and for Sundays\": Photoplay, the nation's leading movie fan magazine in 1933, simply stated in its terse review, \"Mae Clarke fine in a dull tale about a two-timing skyscraper riveter \". Another widely read fan magazine, Picture Play, summed up the film in even fewer words: \"a sour and sordid picture\". In their weekly reports to Motion Picture Herald in the spring and summer of 1933, theater owners in various locations in the United States personally complained about the film's plot and about the MGM production's poor drawing power at their box offices. Herman J. Brown, for example, owner of the Majestic Theatre in Nampa, Idaho, described Fast Workers as an \"Unsatisfactory picture with a weak ending\", noting it \"Won't please\" and \"Business not good\" during its screenings. Far from Idaho, Edith Fordyce, the proprietor of the Princess Theatre in Selma, Louisiana, advised her colleagues to present the film \"on bargain night if you have to show it.\" Theater owner A. E. Hancock in Columbia City, Indiana specifically blamed Gilbert for the film's poor reception in his town. \"The picture has some action and should have got  money\", insisted Hancock, \"for Armstrong and Mae Clarke are liked but Gilbert is too much of a liability to put any picture over here.\" Despite the film's numerous detractors in the print media, The Boston Globe, The Hartford Courant, and The Film Daily were among the relatively few newspapers and trade publications in 1933 that recommended the MGM release to their readers, although with some reservations. There were also defenders and apologists for Gilbert in the media, reviewers who insisted that weak scripts were largely responsible for any perceived deficiencies in the actor's performance in Fast Workers and in most of his earlier \"talkies\".

In another part of the chalet, high-ranking generals from the U.S. and Soviet militaries secretly agree to form a conspiracy to sabotage the talks.  When U.S. General Carlson refuses to go along with the plot, he is assassinated outside the chalet by a pair of German hikers who slipped through the chalet's perimeter. Gallagher is blamed for the disaster, and assigned as punishment to escort a \"package\", an Army sergeant named Walter Henke , from West Berlin back to the United States for court martial. After landing at Dulles International Airport, Gallagher is ambushed by an undercover team, who spirit Henke away.  Gallagher tracks down Henke's wife and is surprised when she identifies a photo of a much younger man as her husband, confirming that the \"Henke\" who entered the States is an imposter.  After he leaves, the same undercover team kills Mrs. Henke and phones in an anonymous tip, identifying Gallagher as the killer.  When he reports to his new duty assignment, he is detained on suspicion of murder. Meanwhile, the real Walter Henke is approached in Germany by Colonel Glen Whitacre , one of the conspirators, who tasks him with a top secret assignment to infiltrate a Neo-Nazi gang in his hometown of Chicago, who they believe are plotting to assassinate the President. With the help of his ex-wife, Lt. Colonel Eileen Gallagher , and her assistant, Lt. Ruth Butler , Gallagher identifies the man he brought back from Germany as Thomas Boyette, a long-service Army veteran with a history of covert operations.  Gallagher asks why anyone would impersonate a soldier about to be court-martialed, and the explanation given is that Boyette was able to enter the country without a passport, meaning there is no record of his entry and no way to track his movements. When the same undercover team kills Butler and attacks Eileen, Johnny rescues her and escapes the base with the help of a friend.  Knowing that they cannot trust anyone in the chain of command, the two investigate the conspiracy on their own, starting with trying to find the real Walter Henke in Chicago, where the next phase of the planned peace talks will take place. Johnny approaches his former Vietnam friend, Milan Delich , now a Lieutenant with the Chicago police, who allows the Gallaghers to hide at his house.  A setup at a diner with a murder attempt by the same undercover team wounds Delich. As Delich is taken away by ambulance, conspirators dressed as cops capture Johnny, who is then held in the basement of the safe house where Boyette is staying. After Boyette leaves for his assignment, Gallagher escapes and speeds toward downtown Chicago, using Boyette's surveillance photos from the basement as a guide to the planned assassination site.  Meanwhile, the real Walter Henke is lured into an office building overlooking the site and killed by Boyette, the intention being to frame Henke for the assassination and make it look like he was killed later. Following a hotel luncheon, the Soviet Press Secretary, one of the conspirators, convinces the General Secretary to make an unplanned stop just outside the hotel's garage for a photo op with \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian families. Before the Secret Service can reach the site, Boyette takes aim at the General Secretary with a sniper rifle, but Gallagher bursts into the room in the nick of time and shoots Boyette dead. Outside the room where he found Boyette, Gallagher confronts Whitacre and accuses him of trying to start a war for no reason.  Angrily, Whitacre says that nuclear weapons are the only thing preventing conventional war from breaking out between Russia and the United States, and he and his Soviet counterparts are just smart enough to realize that mutual disarmament would be disastrous for both countries. Gallagher promises to expose the conspiracy and storms away, ignoring Whitacre's threats.  On the street, Johnny reunites with Eileen and hugs her gratefully. In voice over, Ike Pappas reports that Gallagher is appearing before a session of Congress to report what he knows of the conspiracy, including identifying Whitacre as one of its leaders. After his confrontation with Gallagher, Whitacre enters a limousine with his Soviet counterpart, who asks him what their next step is.  Before he can answer, their driver pulls over the car and shoots both colonels dead, thus ensuring that any blame will fall on them and the remaining conspirators will not be exposed.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_780", "question": "Who was the producer of The Beginning?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_52767", "text": "In the 1970s, director William Friedkin obtained the film rights to The Spirit and contacted Will Eisner to write a script for him. Eisner declined but recommended Harlan Ellison, who wrote a two-hour live-action script for the filmmaker. Friedkin and Ellison afterward had an unrelated argument, and the project was abandoned. During the 1980s, Brad Bird, Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz attempted to get an animated adaptation off the ground, though studio executives praised the screenplay, they thought the film would be unmarketable, and this version was scrapped. In the early 1990s, producer Michael Uslan and executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Steven Maier subsequently obtained the rights for a live-action film adaptation. The producer promised Eisner that he would not permit anyone who \"didn't get it\" to work on the project. Two ideas pitched to Uslan were to put the Spirit in a costume and to have the Spirit be a resurrected dead man who possessed supernatural powers. Screenwriter John Turman, a comic book fan, expressed interest in writing the script. In July 2004, financier OddLot Entertainment acquired the rights to the film. OddLot's producers Gigi Pritzker and Deborah Del Prete began a collaboration with Uslan, Melniker, and Maier working at Batfilm Productions, to adapt the story. Eisner, who was protective of the rights to his creations, said that he believed in the producers to faithfully adapt The Spirit. In April 2005, comic-book writer Jeph Loeb was hired to adapt The Spirit for the big screen, but the writer eventually left the project. Later in April, Uslan approached Frank Miller at Will Eisner's memorial service in New York City several weeks after Miller's Sin City was released in theaters, interested in initiating the adaptation technique with Miller's film for The Spirit.  Miller had initially hesitated, doubting his skill in adapting The Spirit, but ultimately embraced his first solo project as writer-director. Miller described his decision-making: In July 2006, the film trade press reported Miller would write and direct the film adaptation for The Spirit\u2009; Miller and the producers publicly announced this at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Miller said that he was putting together a film treatment that included large parts of The Spirit strip panels. As Miller described the project, \"I intend to be extremely faithful to the heart and soul of the material, but it won't be nostalgic. It will be much scarier than people expect\". Miller filmed The Spirit using the same digital background technology that was used for Sin City and 300. The film would also copy specific shots from the comic, similar to Sin City. In February 2007, Miller completed the first draft of the screenplay and began work on a second draft.  Principal photography was initially slated to begin in late spring 2007.  Miller also planned to begin filming Sin City 2 in spring 2009, and Uslan indicated that filming for The Spirit would begin before Miller started Sin City 2. Following the casting of Gabriel Macht as the Spirit in August 2007, filming was re-slated for the following October.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She rents a small room in the home of a gay couple, has a lousy love life and drives a rust bucket of a car that she cannot afford to repair. The car breaks down, blocking the route of a diplomatic convoy that is traveling to the White House. Unsympathetic to Sunny's predicament, the Diplomatic Security Service treat the incident as a possible security threat and move into full security mode, guns drawn. Sunny is naive to the seriousness of her situation, concerned only that she will now be late for work. At the Safari Club where Sunny works, her night is getting worse. Her date cancels and she is forced to wear an emu suit because all of the other costumes are now taken by waitresses who arrived on time. She hates the costume because it invites unwanted sexual propositions. Even though she is \"so broke,\" she refuses an offer from a patron requesting special \"favors\" in return for cash, as well as a loan from a waitress friend, Ella. On her way home, Sunny is curious about the media attention surrounding a gala dinner, so she stops to watch the dignitaries leaving the event. A man of Middle Eastern descent rudely pushes past her. Sunny feels something hard in his coat pocket. She asks if he has a gun. To her horror, he does. A shot is fired, but Sunny prevents him taking aim at his target by biting his arm. In the ensuing commotion, both Sunny and the gunman are forced to the ground and another shot is fired. Sunny cries out, realizing she has been shot. Through news media reports, we learn that Sunny has been taken to the hospital and is being lauded as a heroine. She has prevented the assassination of a visiting Emir, who had been in Washington to further relations between the US and his \"small, but strategic Middle Eastern country\", El Othar. Doctors remove a bullet from Sunny's left buttock. While recovering, she finds herself thrust into public adoration, receiving mail from celebrities and countless marriage proposals. Michael Ransome, a Middle Eastern desk chief from the State Department, pays a visit to help Sunny get through her first press conference since the shooting. Sunny answers each question about her life with humor and charm, revealing herself to be hugely likeable, intelligent and patriotic. She also reveals that she has never voted, preferring to consider herself as just an American, rather than any political label. Back at the White House, politicians Crowe and Hilley are watching the conference. They joke that if Sunny is to be believed, she could run for office because of her appeal to so many large groups of voters, including working women, small town folk, senior citizens, gays, the \"law-and-order bunch,\" baseball fans, bar flys and animal lovers. They contact the President of the United States , and arrange for him to call Sunny at the hospital. The Emir whose life Sunny saved was being wooed by the US, which wants to establish a military base in his country because of its ideal geographic location in the Middle East. He decides that he will allow the US to build its base in his country \u2014 on the proviso that they allow him to claim Sunny as another wife. Without the President's knowledge, the State Department decides to trade Sunny for the base without her knowledge. The Vice President of the United States offers her a job within the Protocol Department of the Government. She has to look up what \"protocol\" means in a dictionary, but when she realizes he is offering her a well-paying job, she accepts. Sunny approaches her new job with nervous excitement, She attends formal dinners and meets dignitaries from foreign countries. At one dinner, she is introduced to Nawaf Al Kabeer, who thanks Sunny on behalf of the Emir, and presents a car to her, as a thank-you gift from the Emir. She returns it, having researched that as a government employee, she is unable to accept gifts. But this act infuriates both the Emir and the State Department. Sunny is unaware that in the Emir's country, the local population is aware that Sunny is to be a new Queen, and anger is growing. Sunny is told that the Emir wants to meet her personally, and that she is to \"show him a good time.\" She looks upon this invitation as a way to help her old boss Lou by arranging a party at his failing Safari Club, where she used to work. Lou has not closed the bar to his regular patrons and Sunny has invited friends of her own. The party gets out of control, the Police make arrests and all of this is filmed by the media. Ambassador St. John sees this as a perfect opportunity to finally make the trade. She tells Sunny to go with the Emir to \"represent her country\" and make amends. Sunny arrives in the Emir's country to find a mural of herself in wedding attire. She realizes it's a set-up, that she was traded so the US could build its base. The Emir confirms this. Unable to produce sons, he needs a new wife. Before an angry Sunny can respond, a violent coup d'\u00e9tat takes place in the Emir's country of Otah, and the two are forced to flee. Back in the US, the government denies knowledge of the trade and the public is now questioning whether Sunny knew all along of the plan. She must also face a Congressional inquiry to find out the truth. Ransome quits his job in disgust at what was done to Sunny. At the inquiry, Sunny cuts the proceedings short by accepting blame, having taken an important job without fully understanding the political affairs of her country. But she reminds everyone that leaders have a responsibility toward the people. She warns the political powers in the room that, from now on, she will watch all of them \"like a hawk.\" Two years later, Sunny has married Ransome and they have a baby. She is also running for Congress in her hometown of Diamond Junction in Oregon, and gets a call telling her that she has won.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In January 2007, actors Andre Braugher and Laurie Holden joined Jane for the cast of The Mist. Production began the following February at StageWorks of Louisiana, a sound stage and film production facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. Marcia Gay Harden and Toby Jones joined the cast later in the month. William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Brian Libby, each of whom appeared in Darabont's previous Stephen King adaptations The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, were cast in supporting roles. Sadler had previously played Jane's role, David Drayton, in a 1986 audiobook version of \"The Mist\". Darabont wanted to cast King in the supporting role that eventually went to Brian Libby, an offer that King turned down because he did not want to travel to film the part. Darabont sought to pursue \"a more fluid, ragged documentary kind of direction\" with The Mist, so he contacted the camera crew from the television series The Shield, after having directed one episode, to use their style in the film. Darabont attempted to film The Mist digitally but found that it \"wound up looking too beautiful\". The director chose to film with 400 ASA from Fujifilm, which gave footage a grainy effect. In the opening shot, David is drawing in his room. The drawing is based on King's Dark Tower series, and was painted by film poster designer Drew Struzan. Darabont also included reproductions of Struzan's posters and illustrations for The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Struzan went on to produce a poster for The Mist, but this image was not used in the film's marketing campaign. Darabont collaborated with the production designer to create a mix of eras to avoid appearing as a period piece, but also not looking so contemporary. Cell phones were used by characters in The Mist, but the military police in the film did not dress in modern attire. While an MP also drove an old Jeep instead of a Humvee, other cars seen in the film are modern models. The city police cars in the beginning of the film are a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice and a 1988 Ford LTD Crown Victoria, cars that were standard police vehicles in the late 1980s, but have not been used in force since the late 1990s. Over 100 extras from Shreveport, Louisiana, were included in The Mist. Unlike conventional application of extras in the background of a film, 60 extras were interwoven with the film's ensemble cast. Additional elements giving the film a local flavor include the prominence of local Louisiana brands such as Zapp's potato chips. Exterior shots of the house at the beginning were in Shreveport. Exterior shots of the supermarket were in Vivian, Louisiana. Also, if closely inspected, the shields on the side of the passing firetrucks early in the film identify them as part of the Caddo Parish fire department.

O'Connor knew from the beginning that he wanted to cast Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks because he needed someone with an athletic background and a fiery passion for sports. The casting of the team consisted of real hockey players to give the film a raw and accurate feel. O'Connor figured it would be easier to teach hockey players to act than to teach actors to play hockey. On-ice tryouts were held in New York, Boston, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Vancouver. Another tryout was held in Vancouver for the Soviet and European teams. There are a total of 133 different hockey plays in the film. To accomplish this, the directors turned to ReelSports Solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, The Rookie. The ReelSports team referred to coach Herb Brooks for information on practices, plays, equipment, and uniform styles. Each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors' safety. Players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment. All of the locations of the real life hockey games are replicated by hockey arenas in British Columbia. The team tryouts, set in Colorado Springs, were filmed at the Queen's Park Arena in New Westminster. The team practices were filmed at the M.S.A. Arena in Abbotsford. The exhibition game in which the USA team lost to the USSR team at Madison Square Garden was filmed at the Pacific Coliseum, former home of the Vancouver Canucks. The Exhibition against Norway, the subsequent bag skate, and all Olympic game scenes were filmed at the PNE Agrodome. Al Michaels re-recorded most of his television commentary for the film. However, the last 30 seconds of the USA-Soviet game, including \"Do you believe in miracles?\" used the original audio, as Michaels didn't feel he could re-create the call effectively.

The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early; to calm them, Sheriff Woody, Andy's favorite toy and their leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on the gift opening with a baby monitor. The other toys are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them. Andy then receives a last-minute surprise gift \u2013 a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is a real space ranger. Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features and becomes Andy's new favorite, making Woody jealous. Two days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy. To ensure Andy chooses him and not Buzz, Woody tries to use the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk, but accidentally knocks him out a window instead. The other toys believe Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact revenge. A vengeful Buzz stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind. After a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant. Buzz mistakenly believes a claw crane full of Little Green Men to be a true rocket, and Woody climbs in after him. Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor Sid spots and captures the two and takes them to his house, where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his much-abused \"mutant\" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed. As Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a TV commercial that reveals he is indeed a toy. In denial, he attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and falls into despair. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a rocket, but a thunderstorm forces him to delay the launch until the next morning. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to launch him, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten Sid into never harming toys again, freeing Buzz. Woody and Buzz pursue Andy's moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody. Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz. The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC, toss Woody back into the street. Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error. During the chase, RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz. As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy's car, landing safely beside Andy. At Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift opening again while the other toys wait. Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head, and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \"worse\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Tennessee Valley Authority owns over 90% of the state's generating capacity. Nuclear power is Tennessee's largest source of electricity generation, producing about 47.3% of its power in 2020. The same year, 20.2% of the power was produced from natural gas, 18.4% from coal, 13.4% from hydroelectricity, and 1.6% from other renewables. About 61.3% of the electricity generated in Tennessee produces no greenhouse gas emissions. Tennessee is home to the two newest civilian nuclear power reactors in the U.S., at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Rhea County. Tennessee was also an early leader in hydroelectric power, and today is the third-largest hydroelectric power-producing state east of the Rocky Mountains. Tennessee is a net consumer of electricity, receiving power from other TVA facilities in neighboring states. Tennessee has very little petroleum and natural gas reserves, but is home to one oil refinery, in Memphis. Bituminous coal is mined in small quantities in the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains. There are sizable reserves of lignite coal in West Tennessee that remain untapped. Coal production in Tennessee peaked in 1972, and today less than 0.1% of coal in the U.S. comes from Tennessee. Tennessee is the nation's leading producer of ball clay. Other major mineral products produced in Tennessee include sand, gravel, crushed stone, Portland cement, marble, sandstone, common clay, lime, and zinc. The Copper Basin, in Tennessee's southeastern corner in Polk County, was one of the nation's most productive copper mining districts between the 1840s and 1980s, and supplied about 90% of the copper the Confederacy used during the Civil War. Mining activities in the basin resulted in a major environmental disaster, which left the surrounding landscape barren for more than a century. Iron ore was another major mineral mined in Tennessee until the early 20th century. Tennessee was also a top producer of phosphate until the early 1990s.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_790", "question": "Who was the producer of Happy Together?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_31594", "text": "During 1980, drummer Levine departed again and Bluechel, who had been concentrating on singing only, stepped back behind the drums again. Jim Yester left again in June 1983 and the group added Keith Moret as Alexander went back to playing guitar. Moret stayed only briefly until Joe LaManno joined during July 1984. That same year, the group was invited to appear on the Happy Together Again tour, a multi-bill of 1960s acts produced by David Fishof , headlined by the Turtles, and also including Gary Puckett and Spanky McFarlane of Spanky & Our Gang. Gary's brother, Brian Puckett, played drums in the show for Gary and McFarlane and likewise joined The Association for their set as well. During the latter part of the tour, Mike Peed joined on keyboards in place of Ulsky but left himself in November 1984, turning it over to Donni Gougeon . But by the end of the year, there was a mass exodus as Kirkman , Bluechel, LaManno and Brian Puckett all departed. In February 1985, the band carried on as Alexander, Giguere, Ramos and Gougeon recruited new members: Paul Beach and Bruce Pictor . Gougeon was replaced in early 1987 by Chris Urmston but was himself succeeded by Paul Holland later the same year. In 1989, when Beach quit, Holland switched over to bass as Gougeon then rejoined for a ten-year stint from 1989 to 1999 before illness in his family called him away. He was replaced by Jordan Cole, son of the band's original bassist, Brian Cole; Jordan first played with the band on a Caribbean Christmas cruise in December 1998, when he was asked to fill in for Holland on bass. Besides the Happy Together tour, the group became mainstays on many other 1960s package tours, including the 1988 Super 60s Tour with Gary Puckett, the Grass Roots, and the Turtles; and Dick Clark's American Bandstand Tour in 1989, alongside The Spinners, The Guess Who and The Drifters, sponsored by VH1. Alexander turned in his notice in early 1989. Larry Ramos's brother Del, who had started audio mixing for the group in the 1970s, and then again in the early 1980s, and had begun adding his voice to the mix from the sound board from 1985 on, also assumed bass duties in 1999 after Holland left to tend to his light and sound company. Bob Werner , who had been the band's light man and road manager in 1974\u201375 and fill-in member as needed from 1989 on, was also a member of the group from 1999 to 2008. During the 1980s and 1990s, the group's recorded output was minimal. They recorded a few new tracks and some covers of popular 1960s songs for a few compilation albums on the Hitbound label made through RadioShack's Tandy Corporation in the mid-1980s, including their first cover of \"Walk Away Ren\u00e9e\" that was recorded in collaboration with their original producer, Curt Boettcher, for the Mike Love and Dean Torrence 1983 cassette tape Rock 'n' Roll City, two Christmas covers contributed to another Radio Shack album, Scrooge's Rock 'n' Roll Christmas , and an album of 1960s tunes called New Memories . They also re-recorded some of their older material and even more cover songs for another album, Vintage, for CBS in 1983 and put out yet another album full of covers, The Association 95: A Little Bit More, in 1995 from On Track Records , produced by John Allen Orofino and Stan Vincent. A Little Bit More'''s featured single was their second remake of The Left Banke's \"Walk Away Ren\u00e9e\". Over the years, the group were sometimes visited by former members: Bluechel and Alexander sat in on a few of their 2001 shows, while Paul Holland guested on their DVD, Pop Legends Live!, which came out in 2005. And in September 2003, they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, joined by Yester, Alexander, Kirkman and Bluechel at the induction ceremony at Cafaro Field in Niles, Ohio. Yester, Alexander, Kirkman and Bluechel again rejoined the others for the taping of a PBS 1960s rock music special 60s Experience on December 9, 2004 at Dover Downs Showroom in Dover, Delaware. In 2007 David Jackson came into the group for a brief stint when Del Ramos was ill, then Jim Yester returned to sub for Werner. After which, Werner and Yester alternated in the group until late 2008 when Werner left altogether. Also in 2007, they joined Barry Manilow on a remake combining their two biggest hits, \"Cherish\" and \"Windy\", that was released on his Greatest Hits of The '60s album. In 2008, drummer Pictor underwent back surgery. Blair Anderson sat in for Pictor until he was able to rejoin his bandmates that November. By 2010, the band included Giguere, Ramos, Jim Yester, Del Ramos, Pictor and Jordan Cole. The Association continued to tour, mostly on bills with similar styled acts of the late 1960s, like the Grass Roots, the Buckinghams, Tommy James and Gary Puckett. During the summer of 2011, The Association carried a heavy touring schedule throughout the U.S. as part of the Happy Together: 2011 tour, along with the Grass Roots, Mark Lindsay, the Buckinghams and the Turtles featuring Flo & Eddie. The Happy Together appearances featured only Giguere, Ramos and Yester, who were backed up by the Happy Together show band. In late 2011, Ramos was sidelined due to illness, so guitarist Godfrey Townsend subbed for him. In January 2012, Alexander came back to the band as Ramos's stand-in and stayed after Ramos returned in March. In 2013, Alexander, Giguere, Ramos and Yester became part of the Where the Action Is tour that included Mary Wilson of the Supremes, Paul Revere and the Raiders and Mitch Ryder.Shindig Magazine named the Now Sounds reissue of the album The Association the best reissue of 2013. In January 2014, it was announced that both Giguere and Ramos would be retiring from touring. Giguere was to move behind the scenes to the group's management, while Ramos's final performance with the group was a cancer benefit concert on February 24, 2014 at the Blue Fox Theater in Grangeville, Idaho. Upon returning from spending his 72nd birthday in his homeland of Hawaii, Ramos died from melanoma on April 30, 2014. After Ramos' death, former member Paul Holland was brought back into the group, this time as a guitarist/vocalist. In the summers of 2015, 2017 and 2018, The Association again joined the 'Happy Together' tour. The Association was inducted into the Pop Music Hall of Fame's 2016 class in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. In May 2016, Texas guitarist Paul Wilson filled in for Paul Holland at an Association performance in Monroe, Wisconsin. Wilson also subbed for Holland on two occasions in 2018: two shows during the \"Flower Power Cruise\" in late February , and then again in May for one show at the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Then in October 2018, Jim Yester was unable to perform two concerts. For the appearances in Red Rock, Oklahoma and Bangor, Maine, the lineup consisted of: Alexander, Del Ramos, Cole, Pictor, Holland and Wilson. Concerts resumed in 2019 with the regular lineup. In 2018, the first biography of the band \u2014 The Association Cherish \u2014 written by British author Malcolm C. Searles, was published via Dojotone Publications in the UK detailing the groups extensive 50-year career. The Association were recipients of the Rock Justice Awards on January 18, 2019, at Village Studios in Los Angeles. All five surviving founding members - Kirkman, Alexander, Yester, Giguere and Bluechel - showed up to receive their awards. Ramos and founding member Cole also received awards.

It became the band's third top-10 album, peaking at number five, and yielded the top-40 hit \"Even It Up\". The band embarked on a 77-city tour to promote the album. By the end of the year, the band scored its highest-charted single at the time, a version of the ballad \"Tell It Like It Is\", which peaked at number eight. In November 1980, the double album Greatest Hits/Live was released and reached number twelve on the US chart, eventually achieving double-platinum status. The two-disc set featured studio versions of most of Heart's singles to date, plus a few new studio tracks and six live tracks, among which were versions of \"Unchained Melody\", Led Zeppelin's \"Rock and Roll\" and the Beatles' \"I'm Down\". Heart was the first band of the day to appear at the sold-out concert headlined by Queen at Elland Road on May 29, 1982. Their next album, Private Audition , provided the minor hit \"This Man Is Mine\" and was the first not produced by Mike Flicker. Initially, the band turned to Jimmy Iovine, one of the leading producers of the time, who suggested that the material lacked potential hits, and eventually, the Wilson sisters produced the album themselves. The track \"Perfect Stranger\" foreshadowed the power ballads that would dominate the band's mid-1980s sound. At the end of recording, Derosier and Fossen were fired from the band. They were replaced by Denny Carmassi on drums and Mark Andes on bass for Passionworks , while at the record company's insistence, the band turned to established producer Keith Olsen.

{"id": "164_794", "question": "Who was the producer of The Assault?", "ctxs": [{"id": "218_44099", "text": "At around 12:30\u00a0a.m. on February 8, 2009, Brown and his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna, had an argument which escalated into physical violence, leaving Rihanna with visible facial injuries which required hospitalization. Brown turned himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire station at 6:30\u00a0p.m. and was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. The police report did not name the female in the incident as is policy, but media sources soon revealed that the victim was Rihanna. Following Brown's arrest, several commercial ads and some TV shows featuring him were suspended, his music was withdrawn from multiple radio stations, and he withdrew from public appearances, including one at the 2009 Grammy Awards, where he was replaced by Justin Timberlake and Al Green. Brown hired a crisis management team and released a statement saying, \"Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired.\" On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats. He was arraigned on April 6, 2009, and pleaded not guilty to one count of assault and one count of making criminal threats. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years of probation, and domestic violence counseling. On July 20, 2009, Brown released a two-minute video on his official YouTube page apologizing to fans and Rihanna for the assault, expressing the incident as his \"deepest regret\" and saying that he has repeatedly apologized to Rihanna and \"accepts full responsibility\". In the video, Brown said he wanted to speak out earlier about the case but was advised by his attorney not to until the legal ramifications were settled. The video was removed, but is still available online. On August 25, Brown received five years of probation. He was ordered to attend one year of domestic violence counseling and undergo six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which required him to remain 50 yards away from Rihanna, reduced to 10 yards at public events. Andy Kellman of AllMusic stated, \"A fairly substantial backlash resulted in Brown's songs being pulled from rotation on several radio stations. Ultimately, however, it had little bearing on the progress of his music and acting careers.\" On September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded Larry King Live interview, his first public interview about the matter. He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\" Brown's mother said Brown \"has never, ever been a violent person, ever\" and that she does not believe in the cycle of violence. Brown said that it is \"tough\" for him to look at the famous photograph released of Rihanna's battered face, which may be the one image to haunt and define him forever, and that he still loved her. \"I'm pretty sure we can always be friends,\" said Brown, \"and I don't know about our relationship, but I just know definitely that we ended as friends.\" He stated he did not feel that his career was over, and likened his relationship with Rihanna to Romeo and Juliet, blaming the media attention in the aftermath of the assault for driving them apart. In June 2010, Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was rejected on the grounds of him \"being guilty of a serious criminal offence\" due to his assault on Rihanna. Brown had been planning to do a tour of British cities as part of a European tour but Sony stated that due to \"issues surrounding his work visa\" the tour was to be postponed. In February 2011, at the request of Brown's lawyer, Judge Patricia Schnegg modified with Rihanna's agreement the restraining order to a \"level one order,\" allowing both singers to appear at awards shows together in the future. The following month, on March 22, 2011, during an interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America at the Times Square Studios, where he was asked about the Rihanna situation and restraining order, Brown started crying and became violent in his dressing room during a commercial break before his second performance ending that day's program, and punched a window overlooking Times Square, causing damage to it. He then took off his shirt, and after several angry confrontations with the segment producer, other show staff and building security, left the building shirtless. Following the incident, he apologized and said that he was very tired of people bringing up the incident. On July 11, 2012, Brown's community service was evaluated and he was ordered to meet a judge. The evaluation was ordered by Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg on July 10, 2012. He was scheduled to appear in court with regard to the evaluation on August 21, 2012. While conducting his community service in Virginia, however, Brown was tested positive for cannabis and appeared in court on September 25, 2012, at which time his hearing date was changed to November, to determine whether or not he had violated the terms of his court order. He reappeared in court on November 1, 2012, he attempted to address the court and was told by his lawyer, Mark Geragos, \"I don't dance; you don't talk.\" On March 20, 2015, Brown's probation ended, formally closing the felony case emanating from the Rihanna assault which happened over six years prior. In a 2017 self-documentary, Welcome to My Life, Brown goes into detail about the abusive relationship, saying he intended to marry Rihanna, but that he lost her trust after finding out that he lied about a sexual encounter with someone who worked with him, that happened prior to their relationship. He also talked about how they already had lighter episodes where they put their hands against each other during their relationship, and he gave a detailed description on how the known fight went down.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film is a sequel to Zombie's 2007 remake of 1978's Halloween and the tenth installment in the Halloween franchise. Picking up where the 2007 film ended and then jumping ahead two years, Halloween II follows Laurie Strode as she deals with the aftermath of the previous film's events, Dr. Loomis who is trying to capitalize on those events by publishing a new book that chronicles everything that happened, and Michael Myers as he continues his search for Laurie so that he can reunite with his sister. The film sees the return of lead cast members from the 2007 film Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, and Tyler Mane, who portray Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers, respectively. For Halloween II, Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Strode and Myers, and the idea that they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. He wanted to portray how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film. Halloween II was officially released on August 28, 2009 in North America, and was met with a negative reception from critics. On October 30, 2009 it was re-released in North America to coincide with the Halloween holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million. The film would go on to earn $33.4 million in North America, and $6 million in foreign countries giving the film a worldwide total of $39.4 million. Rob Zombie declined to return to film another sequel. A sequel, Halloween 3D, was cancelled in 2012. Halloween II is the final Halloween film to be distributed by Dimension Films.

Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine regarded Adore as \"the most intimate album the Pumpkins have ever made and also the prettiest, a parade of swooning melodies and gentle, unfolding nocturnes\". Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork described the album as \"the Pumpkins' best offering since Siamese Dream\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Adore as \"a hushed, elegiac album that sounds curiously out of time\". Adore was considered one of \"an inspiring range of 25 classic alternative American albums\" by The Guardian. The lyrics received particular praise from critics\u2014Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times, who in 1993 had criticized Corgan's lyrics as \"too often sound[ing] like sophomoric poetry\", said Corgan \"took a big leap forward as a lyricist\" starting with Adore. Schreiber, who criticized Mellon Collie as \"lyrical rock-bottom\", called Adores lyrics \"poetic\", particularly singling out \"To Sheila\". Greg Kot emphasized the \"oblique, private longings, and weighty, sometimes awkward conceits\" in the lyrics, while David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called them \"unsettled and unsettling\". The contributions of Wretzky and Iha also received praise, with Kot noting that \"Iha's quirky guitar accents and Wretzky's unflashy resolve [...] give Adore a warmth and camaraderie no other Pumpkins album can match.\" Despite this, public reception to Adore was lukewarm. Adore entered the Billboard album charts at number two with 174,000 units of the album sold, and was certified platinum by the RIAA five weeks later, but the album soon departed the charts, leaving Adore far short of the sales figures of its predecessors. Two additional promotional singles, \"Crestfallen\" and \"To Sheila\", were released to radio stations but failed to gain traction and were never released as commercial singles. As of May 2005, Adore has sold 1.1\u00a0million units in the US, and at least three times as many copies worldwide. Corgan blamed himself for the record's reception with the public, saying he \"made the mistake of telling people it was a techno record\" and that if he \"would have told everyone Adore was the Pumpkins' acoustic album we would have never had the problems that we had\". Corgan wrote on the band's website that the album's title was \"misunderstood\" and \"a joke that no one ever got\", explaining that Adore was meant as a play on \"A Door\", meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band's career.

It's about easy choices and hard decisions and how life still goes on, despite it all. It's a cocktail you definitely wanna try!\" Khalid Mohamed of Deccan Chronicle gave the movie 3.5/5 stars, concluding that \"Whatever the flaws and dips in energy-level, Cocktail is a feel-wonderful movie. Shake it, stir it and get nicely woozy.\" Meena Iyer of Times of India gave the movie 3.5/5 stars, commenting that \"What Cocktail should be truly applauded for is its permissiveness. As a film it breaks shackles and ushers in a new free spirit that Gen-Now will relate to.\" Aniruddha Guha of DNA India gave the movie 3.5/5 stars, stating that \"The best thing about Cocktail is that it is as different as a film can get within a very conventional format.

Cocktail has a handful of moments and a few genuine sparks, but finally crashes and burns so spectacularly that it's hard to focus on the positives. We must thank it, thus, for Diana Penty.\" Kunal Guha of Yahoo! gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, stating that \"One of the chief reasons why this cocktail fails to hit your sweet spot is because you don't empathize with any of the characters. There could be many reasons for this but to point one: none of them seem worthy of your attention and concern. Still keen to figure out who Saif ends up with? Why don\u2019t you deduce it yourself like any mature adult would? I would recommend the scientific method used to pick item girls in films lately: Eenie Meenie\u2026\" Mayank Shekhar of Daily Bhaskar gave the movie 1.5/5 stars, concluding that \"You feel worse for Saif aged 42. It's hard to tell how every woman he meets in the movie gets turned on by his random charms. The world is his playground. He still makes it seem vaguely convincing.

In later years, Channel 4 lauded A Foreign Affair as \"one of Wilder's great forgotten films ... worthy of rapid rediscovery\", while Andrea Mullaney of Eye For Film wrote in 2006 that the film was \"talky, intelligent, cynical\" and \"as relevant to the current American involvement in Iraq as if it had been made yesterday\".

She is frequently berated for breaking any of his house rules, as well as for her lack of looks and confidence, even though she is a wealthy girl who lives in a large, beautifully decorated house and attends a private school. Her only source of kindness at home is her mother, Dilys \"Dilly\" Cookson. Beauty adores rabbits, although Gerry forbids her from having pets. Her favorite television show is \"Rabbit Hutch\", a show for young children about a man, Sam, and his pet rabbit, Lily. Beauty has no friends at all at school. The only student that is nice to her is Rhona, Skye's best friend. However, Rhona desperately wants to be friends with Beauty, which she reveals one day when Skye is at a dentist appointment. Finally, Beauty is invited to a birthday party Rhona is holding. For the birthday party, Gerry forces her to get corkscrew curls, and popular bullies Skye, Arabella and Emily develop a new nickname for her: Ugly Corkscrew. Beauty tells her mother about the teasing and Dilly decides to learn how to bake cookies, even though she is an awful cook, in the hope that Beauty will be given a new nickname, Cookie . Gradually, both Beauty and Dilly get the hang of making cookies and become wondrous at it. Gerry refuses to acknowledge any of this completely doubting Dilly's ability to cook anything at all. Beauty's birthday is approaching and she is dreading it, however Gerry appears to turn over a new leaf and act like an ideal father. Gerry arranges a birthday feast and organizes tickets for all of the girls in her class to see a stage show called 'Birthday Bonanza', with a chauffeur driven limousine to escort them there. Her mother buys a beautiful Victorian-style dress for her, and Beauty invites all the girls, including Skye, and Dilly decides to give out cookies at the end of the party, which Gerry spitefully crushes into crumbs. Rhona gives Beauty a pet rabbit, which she names 'Birthday'. The party soon becomes miserable when, at the show, Beauty feels too shy to go onstage , and Gerry shouts at her in the limousine after all the girls leave. When Dilly and Beauty learn that Birthday has been killed by a fox after Gerry deliberately let him out of his hutch, Dilly decides to separate from him, and she and Beauty pack their things and leave the house. The two drive to Gerry's first wife, Avril, who treats the two kindly but at first looks down upon Dilly's decision to leave Gerry, saying that she has \"deliberately made herself homeless\". She lets them stay for the night until they decide to go on holiday. The holiday resort to which they go is called Rabbit Cove, which Beauty chooses due to her love of rabbits. They find their way to an idyllic seaside resort run by a kind older man named Mike, a painter who takes Dilly on as a breakfast chef in his B&B. Dilly decides to let Gerry know where they are, despite Beauty's objections, but after he shouts at her and calls her a \"useless aging dumb blonde\" she terminates the call. Gerry tracks them down, and yells at them in front of the customers at the caf\u00e9, even going as far as to accuse Dilly of having an affair with Mike and then to punch him in the nose, before driving off. Even though Dilly is living with Mike and he hints that he wants to start dating, Dilly refuses for the time being, as she wants to be independent. He understands. Just before summer, Beauty is sent to a new school which she is adamant about at first until she agrees. At the school she makes friends and is nicknamed the Cookie Girl, but she still keeps in touch with Rhona by writing letters. Beauty is asked to go on 'Watchbox', a talent show that Skye really wanted to be on, due to the rise in popularity of her mother's cookies.

{"id": "164_814", "question": "Who was the producer of 2?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_52767", "text": "In the 1970s, director William Friedkin obtained the film rights to The Spirit and contacted Will Eisner to write a script for him. Eisner declined but recommended Harlan Ellison, who wrote a two-hour live-action script for the filmmaker. Friedkin and Ellison afterward had an unrelated argument, and the project was abandoned. During the 1980s, Brad Bird, Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz attempted to get an animated adaptation off the ground, though studio executives praised the screenplay, they thought the film would be unmarketable, and this version was scrapped. In the early 1990s, producer Michael Uslan and executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Steven Maier subsequently obtained the rights for a live-action film adaptation. The producer promised Eisner that he would not permit anyone who \"didn't get it\" to work on the project. Two ideas pitched to Uslan were to put the Spirit in a costume and to have the Spirit be a resurrected dead man who possessed supernatural powers. Screenwriter John Turman, a comic book fan, expressed interest in writing the script. In July 2004, financier OddLot Entertainment acquired the rights to the film. OddLot's producers Gigi Pritzker and Deborah Del Prete began a collaboration with Uslan, Melniker, and Maier working at Batfilm Productions, to adapt the story. Eisner, who was protective of the rights to his creations, said that he believed in the producers to faithfully adapt The Spirit. In April 2005, comic-book writer Jeph Loeb was hired to adapt The Spirit for the big screen, but the writer eventually left the project. Later in April, Uslan approached Frank Miller at Will Eisner's memorial service in New York City several weeks after Miller's Sin City was released in theaters, interested in initiating the adaptation technique with Miller's film for The Spirit.  Miller had initially hesitated, doubting his skill in adapting The Spirit, but ultimately embraced his first solo project as writer-director. Miller described his decision-making: In July 2006, the film trade press reported Miller would write and direct the film adaptation for The Spirit\u2009; Miller and the producers publicly announced this at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Miller said that he was putting together a film treatment that included large parts of The Spirit strip panels. As Miller described the project, \"I intend to be extremely faithful to the heart and soul of the material, but it won't be nostalgic. It will be much scarier than people expect\". Miller filmed The Spirit using the same digital background technology that was used for Sin City and 300. The film would also copy specific shots from the comic, similar to Sin City. In February 2007, Miller completed the first draft of the screenplay and began work on a second draft.  Principal photography was initially slated to begin in late spring 2007.  Miller also planned to begin filming Sin City 2 in spring 2009, and Uslan indicated that filming for The Spirit would begin before Miller started Sin City 2. Following the casting of Gabriel Macht as the Spirit in August 2007, filming was re-slated for the following October.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who\u00a0\u2013 The Ultimate Adventure. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor. A pilot episode for a potential spinoff series, K-9 and Company, was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series. Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced. Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood , set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, Dreamland, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official Doctor Who website in 2009. Class, featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness.

I think he plays that frustration well. I also love his [Chad's] connection to Vivien in that he and Vivien are both with sex addicts.

Jeff Ma, who was the real-life inspiration for the character Ben Campbell and served as a consultant on the film, was attacked as being a \"race traitor\" on several blogs for not insisting that his character be Asian-American.

Leonard found Out of This World a welcome antidote to The Avengers, which had proved a difficult production; he recalled, \"It was a great pleasure to make, getting away from today and exploring the unrealities of tomorrow. An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000. Shubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis. The actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence. Three scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K. Dick's \"Impostor\" and Clifford D. Simak's \"Immigrant\" as well as an original story called \"Botany Bay\", were supplied by Terry Nation, who would, a short time after, create the Daleks for Doctor Who.

Winehouse predominantly based the album on her tumultuous relationship with then-ex-boyfriend and future husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who temporarily left her to pursue his previous ex-girlfriend. Their short-lived separation spurred her to create an album that explores themes of guilt, grief, infidelity, heartbreak and trauma in a relationship. Influenced by the pop and soul music of 1960s girl groups, Winehouse collaborated with producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson, along with Sharon Jones' band The Dap-Kings, to assist her on capturing the sounds from that time period while blending them with contemporary R&B and neo-soul music. Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded the album's songs with Remi at Instrumental Zoo Studios in Miami and then with Ronson and the Dap-Kings at Chung King Studios and Daptone Records in New York. Tom Elmhirst mixed the album at Metropolis Studios in London. Back to Black was acclaimed by music critics, who praised Winehouse's songwriting and emotive singing style as well as Remi and Ronson's production. The album spawned five singles: \"Rehab\", \"You Know I'm No Good\", \"Back to Black\", \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" and \"Love Is a Losing Game\". It has also been cited as being a key influence to the widespread popularity of British soul throughout the late 2000s, paving the musical landscape for artists such as Adele, Duffy, and Estelle. At the 2008 Grammy Awards, Back to Black won Best Pop Vocal Album and was also nominated for Album of the Year. At the same ceremony, Winehouse won four additional awards, tying her with five other artists as the second-most awarded female in a single ceremony. The album was also nominated at the 2007 Brit Awards for MasterCard British Album and was shortlisted for the 2007 Mercury Prize. Back to Black sold 3.58 million copies in the UK alone, becoming the UK's second best-selling album of the 21st century so far. The album has sold over 16 million copies worldwide. A deluxe edition of Back to Black was released in November 2007, containing a bonus disc of B-sides and live tracks. Winehouse's debut DVD I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London, released that same month, includes a live set recorded at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London and a 50-minute documentary detailing the singer's career over the previous four years.

The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players. Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, \"violet buildings\" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game. Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger. Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players. Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, \"violet buildings\" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game. Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger. Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased . In the story, the Doctor encounters both the Master and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series. Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by \"Time Crash\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor Peter Davison. A set of two mini-episodes, titled \"Space\" and \"Time\" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event. During Children in Need 2011, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need.

The cast included John Price Jones as Tom Marlowe, Mary Lawlor as Connie Lane, Gus Shy as Bobby Randall, Inez Courtney as Babe O'Day, and Zelma O'Neal as Flo. Donald Oenslager designed the production's sets. To emphasize the collegiate atmosphere, ushers wore jerseys, and George Olsen's band reached the orchestra pit by running down the aisles as they shouted college cheers. University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne received credit for \"Advice in Football Technique\". The musical was set in what was then the present day, the Roaring Twenties, and, according to musical theatre historian Gerald Bordman, it was clearly a reflection of that era: \"The decade's jazzy sounds, its assertive, explosive beat, its sophomoric high jinks were joyously mirrored...\" The plot hinged on a professor's unexpected generosity: Tom fails Professor Charles Kenyon's astronomy class, and, even though Connie tutors him, he still fails his makeup exam. Professor Kenyon gives him a passing grade, though, because he, unbeknownst to the students, is actually a football fan. In the 1970s, producer Harry Rigby started the Broadway nostalgia craze with his revivals of No, No, Nanette and Irene.  He decided that Good News would be his next project. Rigby planned to feature former movie musical stars in Good News, as he had in No, No, Nanette and Irene. John Payne was cast as the football coach, and Alice Faye was cast as the astronomy professor, who was renamed Professor Charlotte Kenyon. The book was rewritten to create a romance between their characters, reducing the impact of the college student characters who had made the 1927 version popular.Bordman, p. 741 Because Rigby had already produced No, No, Nanette, a revival set in the 1920s, he moved the setting of Good News to the Depression-era Thirties. During the development of the revival, the score was also altered; some songs from the original 1927 production were removed, while six songs from other Ray Henderson scores were interpolated. Abe Burrows was hired as director and adapter, and Donald Saddler was hired as choreographer; however, during the development of the revival, they were replaced by Michael Kidd as director/choreographer and Garry Marshall as adapter. A few weeks before the Broadway opening, John Payne, whose contract had run out, was replaced by Gene Nelson. After a try-out in Boston, a nationwide tour for almost a year, and 51 previews, a lavish production opened on Broadway on December 23, 1974 at the St. James Theatre where, having failed to charm the critics as its predecessor had, it ran for only 16 regular performances. Saddler was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography. In 1993, Mark Madama and Wayne Bryan revised the book and score for Music Theatre of Wichita. They retained some of the plot elements and score additions from the 1974 production, including the romance between the astronomy professor and football coach, but they returned the story to the 1920s, added back more of the 1927 score, and recentered the book so its main focus was the college students. They also altered the story so Tom, because of Connie's tutoring, passes the test on his own accord without any undeserved help from Professor Kenyon. The production starred Michael Gruber, Kim Huber, Ann Morrison and Scott Schafer. This version has now been licensed for over 400 professional and amateur productions in the United Stages, Canada, and England.  A studio cast recording of this adaptation was released in 1995, performed by many members of the 1993 cast, but with Wayne Bryan returning to the role of Bobby.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The title was originally Man of the Moment but this was changed when it was realised that had been used for a Norman Wisdom film. John Cleese was signed to star. \"No one will believe it but I didn't have an idea for casting,\" said Frayn. Cleese later said the script was \"the best I've ever seen. The same day it landed on my front door, I rang my agent and said, 'I have to do this.' \" \"Stimpson is a victim of circumstance,\" Cleese said. \"As the pressures increase, his behavior becomes more and more erratic.

{"id": "164_839", "question": "Who was the producer of Positive?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_18071", "text": "Entwistle's playing technique incorporated fingerstyle, plectrum, tapping, and the use of harmonics. He changed his style between songs and even during songs to alter the sound he produced. His fingering technique involved plucking strings very forcefully to produce a trebly, twangy sound. He changed his thumb position from pick-up to the E string and occasionally even positioned his thumb near the pick-up. His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest of his fingers outstretched for balance. The Who's studio recordings seldom did justice to Entwistle's playing, in part because he was better heard in concert, where he and Pete Townshend frequently exchanged roles, with Entwistle providing rapid melodic lines and Townshend anchoring the song with rhythmic chord work. At the same time, Townshend noted that Entwistle provided the true rhythmic timekeeping in the band, while Keith Moon, with his flourishes around the kit, was more like a keyboard player. In 1989, Entwistle pointed out that, by modern standards, \"the Who haven't got a proper bass player.\" Entwistle also developed what he called a \"typewriter\" approach to playing the bass. It involved positioning his right hand over the strings so all four fingers could be used to tap percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a distinctive twangy sound. This gave him the ability to play three or four strings at once, or to use several fingers on a single string. It allowed him to create passages that were both percussive and melodic. This method should not be confused with tapping or slapping, and in fact predates these techniques. Modern players such as Ryan Martinie of heavy metal band Mudvayne have used similar techniques. Entwistle can be seen using this technique in Mike Gordon's 2002 film, Rising Low. Notable in his left-hand technique was his use of slides, positioning his left hand for octaves, and his use of the pentatonic when playing with the Who. Entwistle was notorious for the extremely high volume at which he played bass, going so far as to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on lip reading to understand speech in his later years. Randy Bachman of Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling the rush of air from his giant amp stacks.

{"id": "164_841", "question": "Who was the producer of Ed Wood?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_30937", "text": "Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski conceived the idea for a biopic of Ed Wood when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood, The Man in the Angora Sweater, in his sophomore year at USC. However, Karaszewski figured, \"there would be no one on the planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren't the sort of movies that are made.\" Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films for their work on Problem Child and Problem Child 2, Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page film treatment for Ed Wood and pitched the idea to Heathers director Michael Lehmann, with whom they attended USC film school. The basis for their treatment came from Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy, a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues. Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on Heathers, Denise Di Novi. Di Novi had previously worked with Tim Burton on Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing. Burton began reading Nightmare of Ecstasy and some of Wood's letters. He was taken by how he \"wrote about his films as if he was making Citizen Kane, you know, whereas other people perceived them as, like, the worst movies ever\". Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with an aggrandizing bias born of his admiration for Wood's work, rather than the derisive attitude of Wood's detractors. The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton's relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, Vincent Price. He said in an interview, \"Meeting Vincent had an incredible impact on me, the same impact Ed must have felt meeting and working with his idol.\" Meanwhile, Burton had been asked to direct Mary Reilly for Columbia Pictures with Winona Ryder in the title role. However, Burton dropped out of Mary Reilly over Columbia's decision to fast track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts in the title role instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to become interested in directing Ed Wood himself, on the understanding that it could be done quickly. Lehmann said, \"Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to Airheads.\" Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. Ed Wood gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, \"On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous.\" Initially, Ed Wood was in development with Columbia, but when Burton decided he wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, studio head Mark Canton would not agree to it unless Columbia was given a first-look deal. Burton said black-and-white was \"right for the material and the movie, and this was a movie that had to be in black-and-white\". He insisted on total creative control, and so in April 1993, a month before the original start date, Canton put Ed Wood into turnaround. The decision sparked interest from Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox in optioning the film rights, but Burton accepted an offer from Walt Disney Studios, who had previously produced The Nightmare Before Christmas. Similar to Nightmare, Disney released Ed Wood under their Touchstone Pictures banner. With a budget of $18 million, Disney did not feel the film was that much of a risk, and granted Burton total creative autonomy. Burton also refused a salary, and was not paid for his work on Ed Wood. Principal photography began in August 1993, and lasted 72 days. Despite his previous six-film relationship with Danny Elfman, Burton chose Howard Shore to write the film score. Under the pressure of finishing the score for Batman Returns, Burton's relationship with Elfman became strained and Burton admitted he and Elfman experienced \"creative differences\" during The Nightmare Before Christmas. The movie was filmed at various locations in and around the Los Angeles area.", "hasanswer": false}]}

That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15\u00a0million in its first year sales. In 1987, Cher signed with Geffen Records and revived her musical career with what music critics Johnny Danza and Dean Ferguson describe as \"her most impressive string of hits to date\", establishing her as a \"serious rock and roller\u00a0... a crown that she'd worked long and hard to capture\". Michael Bolton, Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child, and Richie Sambora produced her first Geffen album, Cher. Despite facing strong retail and radio airplay resistance upon its release, the album proved to be a commercial success, certified platinum by the RIAA. Cher features the rock ballad \"I Found Someone\", Cher's first US top-ten single in more than eight years. By the end of the 1980s, Cher was also receiving attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men. She had romantic relationships with actors Val Kilmer, Eric Stoltz, and Tom Cruise, hockey player Ron Duguay, film producer Josh Donen, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, and Rob Camilletti, a bagel baker 18-years her junior whom she dated from 1986 to 1989. Cher's 19th studio album Heart of Stone was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The music video for its second single, \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", caused controversy due to Cher's performance on the battleship , straddling a cannon, and wearing a leather thong that revealed her tattooed buttocks. The song topped the Australian charts for seven weeks, reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became one of Cher's most successful singles. Other songs from Heart of Stone to reach the US top ten were \"After All\", a duet with Peter Cetera, and \"Just Like Jesse James\". At the 1989 People's Choice Awards, Cher won the Favorite All-Around Female Star Award. She embarked on the Heart of Stone Tour in 1989. Most critics liked the tour's nostalgic nature and admired Cher's showmanship. Its parent television special Cher at the Mirage was filmed during a concert in Las Vegas. In her first film in three years, Mermaids , Cher paid tribute to her own mother in this story about a woman who moves her two daughters from town to town at the end of a love affair. She clashed with the film's first two directors, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and Frank Oz, who were replaced by Richard Benjamin. Believing Cher would be the star attraction, the producers allowed her creative control for the film. Mermaids was a box office success and received generally positive reviews. One of the two songs Cher recorded for the film's soundtrack, a cover version of Betty Everett's \"The Shoop Shoop Song \", topped the UK Singles Chart for five weeks. Cher's final studio album for Geffen Records, Love Hurts , stayed at number one in the UK for six weeks and produced the UK top-ten single \"Love and Understanding\". The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label \"hit years\" had been especially significant to her, \"because I was getting to do songs that I really loved\u00a0... songs that really represented me, and they were popular!\" She released the exercise book Forever Fit in 1991, followed by the 1992 fitness videos CherFitness: A New Attitude and CherFitness: Body Confidence. She embarked on the Love Hurts Tour during 1992. That year, the UK-only compilation album Greatest Hits: 1965\u20131992 peaked at number one in the country for seven weeks. It features three new songs: \"Oh No Not My Baby\", \"Whenever You're Near\", and \"Many Rivers to Cross\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Wepner was TKO'd in the 15th\u00a0round of the match by Ali, with few expecting him to last as long as he did. Despite the match motivating Stallone to begin work on Rocky, he has denied Wepner provided any inspiration for the script. Other inspiration for the film may have included characteristics of real-life boxers Rocky Marciano and Joe Frazier, as well as Rocky Graziano's autobiography Somebody Up There Likes Me and the movie of the same name. Wepner sued Stallone who eventually settled for an undisclosed amount. At the time, Film Artists Management Enterprises , a joint venture between Hollywood talent agents Craig T. Rumar and Larry Kubik, represented Stallone. He submitted his script to Rumar and Kubik, who immediately saw the potential for it to be made into a motion picture. They shopped the script to various producers and studios in Hollywood but were repeatedly rejected because Stallone insisted that he be cast in the lead role. Eventually, they secured a meeting with Winkler-Chartoff productions. After repeated negotiations with Rumar and Kubik, Winkler-Chartoff agreed to a contract for Stallone to be the writer and also star in the lead role for Rocky. United Artists liked Stallone's script and viewed it as a vehicle for a well-established star like Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal, Burt Reynolds, or James Caan. Stallone's agents insisted that Stallone portray the title character, to the point of issuing an ultimatum. Stallone later said that he would never have forgiven himself had the film become a success with somebody else in the lead. He also knew that producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff's contract with the studio enabled them to \"greenlight\" a project if the budget was kept low enough. The producers also collateralized any possible losses with their big-budget entry, New York, New York .

Rather, Zanuck hired producer Paul Monash since he was the studio's profit maker, resulting in McQueen's departure from the project, which then fell apart. While McQueen was making Le Mans Foster acquired the rights to Jim Thompson's crime novel The Getaway. Foster sent McQueen a copy of the book urging him to do it. The actor was looking for a \"good/bad guy\" role and saw these qualities in the novel's protagonist, Doc McCoy. Foster looked for a director and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was reached. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? , starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation that he had to start right away. The director wanted to do both, but the studio refused. When McQueen heard this, he became upset and told Bogdanovich that he was going to get someone else to direct The Getaway. McQueen had recently worked with director Sam Peckinpah on Junior Bonner and enjoyed the experience, but the film proved to be unsuccessful. He said: \"Out of all my movies, Junior Bonner did not make one cent. In fact, it lost money.\" McQueen recommended that Foster approach Peckinpah. Like McQueen, Peckinpah was in need of a box office hit and accepted immediately. The filmmaker had read the novel when it was originally published and had talked to Thompson about making a film adaptation when he was starting out as a director. At the time, Peckinpah wanted to make Emperor of the North Pole , a story set during the Great Depression about a brakeman obsessed with keeping homeless people off his train. The film's producer made a deal with Paramount Pictures' production chief Robert Evans, allowing Peckinpah to do his personal project if he first directed The Getaway. The director was soon dismissed from Emperor and told that Paramount was not making The Getaway. A conflict arose with Paramount over the film's budget. Foster had thirty days to set up a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the exclusive rights.

This line-up was to stay constant until 1996, except from a short spell, when Weathers was unwell, and Rick Martinez temporarily took over. After rehearsals, their first gig was on All Fools Day at the Marquee Club in London, and in June 1983 they recorded Friday 13th at The Marquee, but this comprised old numbers, not new material.  Not having a recording contract to promote them, albums were issued on several labels, e.g. Friday 13th was also issued as Live at the Marquee and Talk about a Morning . Later that year, they played the Reading Festival which was recorded for Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show and released as Live at Reading '83 in 1993. In 1983, they also recorded an album of new material in Germany, but fell out with the producer, who was also the album's promoter, so the album was never issued.  The first studio album to be issued, The Twang Dynasty, was issued in 1992 and included the track \"Fast and Dangerous\", which was used on trailers for Paul Whitehouse's Fast Show, although the band were not paid for this. Their performance at 1994's Glastonbury Festival was issued as Live 1994 - Official Bootleg , and in 1995 they recorded Call Down the Moon issued on the Hypertension label, and produced by the band and Ron Sanchez \u2013 a US musician and DJ, who had long championed their cause. Weathers left in 1996, allegedly because Gentle Giant were about to reform, and was replaced by returning drummer Terry Williams, who in the interim, had served in bands such as Dire Straits. Williams recorded some tracks, later released on the Undrugged album, and then Leonard suffered a minor stroke, so the band played a few gigs as a three-piece.  When Leonard returned in 1997, Williams left, to be replaced by drummer Bob Richards, formerly of 'The Wild Family' and 'The Adrian Smith Band'. Former keyboardist Phil Ryan returned in 1998, taking the band back to the classic five-piece line-up, which recorded a live double album 1998 at the Star Club at The Star Club, Oberhausen, West Germany, in March that year. Ryan played a major role in producing Endangered Species , but then had to withdraw from the band for personal reasons. Ryan was replaced by Gareth Llewellyn Thorrington, who missed the recording of Down Town Live at the Down Town Blues Club, Hamburg, in May 2001, as his flight was cancelled due a bomb-scare, but appeared on part of the Undrugged album , which had been started in 1996, and was finally issued in 2002. Undrugged has some classic covers, including \"Sail on, Sailor\" by the Beach Boys and Ray Charles's \"Georgia on My Mind\", both lead vocals being by Micky Jones. In 2002, Micky Jones was diagnosed with a brain tumour and had to take time off for treatment. Jones's place was temporarily taken by his son George Jones, but when Micky had recovered enough to rejoin, in 2004, Leonard decided to leave, again, so George became a permanent member of the band.  In 2005, Micky Jones' health deteriorated due to the re-occurrence of his brain tumour and he was replaced by Martin Ace's son Josh Ace. In November 2006, the album Diamonds and Coal was released, after which Thorrington was sacked, and the band continued as a four-piece.

This line-up also recorded a studio album, but before it was mixed, the band split. Josh Ace, Martin Ace and Phil Ryan recruited James Beck and Rene Robrahn to the new line-up and wiped parts of the album to replace George Jones.  Bob Richards's parts were kept on as they were unable to record over them, due to the lack of a click track.  This album, Kingdom of Noise, was finally released in June 2009. George Jones and Bob Richards formed a new band 'Son of Man', together with Richie Galloni , Marco James and Ray Jones from Welsh band Sassafras and Glenn Quinn from Tigertailz. As of 2020 they are continuing to play Man's music at gigs around England and Wales, having released Son of Man, an album of new material in October 2016. Their second album State Of Dystopia was released in March 2020. After leaving Man, Micky Jones continued to perform for a while, but was then diagnosed with another tumour; he spent the next year and a half in and out of hospital; his health meant he remained at a care home in Swansea for the next three years until he died peacefully, at the age of 63, on 10 March 2010. Clive John, AKA Clint Space, another of the founding members, died after a long fight against emphysema on 24 August 2011 in Hanover Street, Swansea, aged 66. Former bassist Ken Whaley died from lung cancer on 8 May 2013, aged 66. Phil Ryan remained in the band until his death on 30 April 2016, aged 69. A new album, Reanimated Memories, was launched at a gig at The Half Moon, Putney on 22 February 2015, the band's first performance in the UK since October 2011. In 2015 Swansea Museum mounted an exhibition, The Evolution of Man 1965-2014, Acid Rock from Wales, displaying Man memorabilia from the last 50 years, from the collection of local fan, John Bannon. On 31 January 2017 Deke Leonard, one of the founding members of the group and an essential part of the group's history, died at the age of 72. On 13 September 2017, Will Youatt died peacefully in his sleep. Since 2011 Man have been based in Germany, where they still perform occasionally, including autumn tours in 2012 and 2013, and a short UK tour in 2019. For their 50th anniversary tour in 2018, Shane Dixon joined the band as the new drummer and Malcolm Morley returned to play keyboards. Their latest album Anachronism Tango was released in October 2019. Bassist John McKenzie died on 10 May 2020 at the age of 64.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Peart said that the lyrics are related to a tendency that people have for idealizing the lifestyle of others. People tend to imagine that those who are rich and famous are to be viewed as people who have fewer personal issues than ordinary people. However, he argues that every life has its own level of \"toughness.\" As an example of this idea, he recounts that people used to refer to him as someone who has the best job in the world. He claims that he is very proud of being a musician, which was a job that he dreamed of in his youth. However, he claims people tend not to realize that being away from family for several months while on tour is not as easy as others make it sound.  A key verse to express that concept says \"We each pay a fabulous price for our visions of paradise,\" referring to personal sacrifices he had to make to achieve his dream. A Sputnikmusic review gave a description of \"Mission\" as a \"rocky ballad.\" It plays in a D major key, though key changes into Bmajor occur in certain parts of the song. Most of the song is played at a moderate tempo in a time signature of common time. However, the musical interlude between the second chorus and final verse is played in  time. The song features prominent keyboard parts played by Geddy Lee. When working on the song in Britain, producer Peter Collins added brass and choir instrumentation. The brass was performed by the William Faery brass band, and was recorded in Oldham, England. Collins also suggested that new verses be added to the song. A marimba solo is played in the song, in unison with the snare drum and bass. The marimba was a KAT mini-marimba sampled in the AKAI S-900 sampler.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film is a sequel to Zombie's 2007 remake of 1978's Halloween and the tenth installment in the Halloween franchise. Picking up where the 2007 film ended and then jumping ahead two years, Halloween II follows Laurie Strode as she deals with the aftermath of the previous film's events, Dr. Loomis who is trying to capitalize on those events by publishing a new book that chronicles everything that happened, and Michael Myers as he continues his search for Laurie so that he can reunite with his sister. The film sees the return of lead cast members from the 2007 film Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, and Tyler Mane, who portray Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers, respectively. For Halloween II, Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Strode and Myers, and the idea that they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. He wanted to portray how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film. Halloween II was officially released on August 28, 2009 in North America, and was met with a negative reception from critics. On October 30, 2009 it was re-released in North America to coincide with the Halloween holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million.

Historically, the cinema of Peru began in Iquitos in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo because of the rubber boom and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima. Peru also produced the first animated 3-D film in Latin America, Piratas en el Callao. This film is set in the historical port city of Callao, which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the Peruvian company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: Dragones: Destino de Fuego. In February 2006, the film Madeinusa, produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by Claudia Llosa, was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by Magaly Solier and the traumas of post-civil war Peru.

Winehouse predominantly based the album on her tumultuous relationship with then-ex-boyfriend and future husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who temporarily left her to pursue his previous ex-girlfriend. Their short-lived separation spurred her to create an album that explores themes of guilt, grief, infidelity, heartbreak and trauma in a relationship. Influenced by the pop and soul music of 1960s girl groups, Winehouse collaborated with producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson, along with Sharon Jones' band The Dap-Kings, to assist her on capturing the sounds from that time period while blending them with contemporary R&B and neo-soul music. Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded the album's songs with Remi at Instrumental Zoo Studios in Miami and then with Ronson and the Dap-Kings at Chung King Studios and Daptone Records in New York. Tom Elmhirst mixed the album at Metropolis Studios in London. Back to Black was acclaimed by music critics, who praised Winehouse's songwriting and emotive singing style as well as Remi and Ronson's production. The album spawned five singles: \"Rehab\", \"You Know I'm No Good\", \"Back to Black\", \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" and \"Love Is a Losing Game\". It has also been cited as being a key influence to the widespread popularity of British soul throughout the late 2000s, paving the musical landscape for artists such as Adele, Duffy, and Estelle. At the 2008 Grammy Awards, Back to Black won Best Pop Vocal Album and was also nominated for Album of the Year. At the same ceremony, Winehouse won four additional awards, tying her with five other artists as the second-most awarded female in a single ceremony. The album was also nominated at the 2007 Brit Awards for MasterCard British Album and was shortlisted for the 2007 Mercury Prize. Back to Black sold 3.58 million copies in the UK alone, becoming the UK's second best-selling album of the 21st century so far. The album has sold over 16 million copies worldwide. A deluxe edition of Back to Black was released in November 2007, containing a bonus disc of B-sides and live tracks. Winehouse's debut DVD I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London, released that same month, includes a live set recorded at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London and a 50-minute documentary detailing the singer's career over the previous four years.

Following World War I, a group known as the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement was formed as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in war. Those who were opposed to this stand and refused to participate in the war were declared \"disfellowshipped\" by their local Church leaders at the time. When the Church leaders from the General Conference came and admonished the local European leaders after the war to try to heal the damage, and bring the members together, it met with resistance from those who had suffered under those leaders. Their attempts at reconciliation failed after the war and the group became organized as a separate church at a conference that was held on July 14\u201320, 1925. The movement officially incorporated in 1949. In 2005, in another attempt to examine and resolve what its German leaders had done, the mainstream church apologized for its failures during World War II, stating, we deeply regret' any participation in or support of Nazi activities during the war by the German and Austrian leadership of the church.\" In the Soviet Union the same issues produced the group known as the True and Free Seventh-day Adventists. This also formed as the result of a schism within the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Europe during World War I over the position its European church leaders took on having its members join the military or keep the Sabbath. The group remains active today in the former republics of the Soviet Union. Well known but distant offshoots are the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization and the Branch Davidians, themselves a schism within the larger Davidian movement. The Davidians formed in 1929, following Victor Houteff, after he came out with his book The Shepherd's Rod, which was rejected as heretical. A succession dispute after Houteff's death in 1955 led to the formation of two groups, the original Davidians and the Branches. Later, another ex-Adventist, David Koresh, led the Branch Davidians, until he died in the 1993 siege, at the group's headquarters near Waco, Texas. A number of Adventists who apostatized, such as former ministers Walter Rea and Dale Ratzlaff, have become critics of the church's teachings, and particularly Ellen G. White.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Nebuchadnezzar extensively expanded and rebuilt his capital city of Babylon and the most modern historical and archaeological interpretations of the city reflect it as it appeared after Nebuchadnezzar's construction projects. The projects were made possible through the prospering economy during Nebuchadnezzar's reign, sustained by his conquests. His building inscriptions record work done to numerous temples, notably the restoration of the Esagila, the main temple of Babylon's national deity Marduk, and the completion of the Etemenanki, a great ziggurat dedicated to Marduk. Extensive work was also conducted on civil and military structures. Among the most impressive efforts was the work done surrounding the city's northern ceremonial entrance, the Ishtar Gate. These projects included restoration work on the South Palace, inside the city walls, the construction of a completely new North Palace, on the other side of the walls facing the gate, as well as the restoration of Babylon's Processional Street, which led through the gate, and of the gate itself. The ruins of Nebuchadnezzar's North Palace are poorly preserved and as such its structure and appearance are not entirely understood. Nebuchadnezzar also constructed a third palace, the Summer Palace, built some distance north of the inner city walls in the northernmost corner of the outer walls. The restored Ishtar Gate was decorated with blue and yellow glazed bricks and depictions of bulls and dragons . Similar bricks were used for the walls surrounding the Processional Street, which also featured depictions of lions . Babylon's Processional Street, the only such street yet excavated in Mesopotamia, ran along the eastern walls of the South Palace and exited the inner city walls at the Ishtar Gate, running past the North Palace. To the south, this street went by the Etemenanki, turning to the west and going over a bridge constructed either under the reign of Nabopolassar or Nebuchadnezzar. Some of the bricks of the Processional Street bear the name of the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib on their underside, perhaps indicating that construction of the street had begun already during his reign, but the fact that the upper side of the bricks all bear the name of Nebuchadnezzar suggests that construction of the street was completed under Nebuchadnezzar's reign. Glazed bricks such as the ones used in the Procession Street were also used in the throne room of the South Palace, which was decorated with depictions of lions and tall, stylized palm trees. Nebuchadnezzar also directed building efforts on the city of Borsippa, with several of his inscriptions recording restoration work on that city's temple, the Ezida, dedicated to the god Nabu. Additionally, Nebuchadnezzar also restored the ziggurat of the Ezida, the E-urme-imin-anki, and also worked on the temple of Gula, Etila, as well as numerous other temples and shrines in the city. Nebuchadnezzar also repaired Borsippa's walls. Other great building projects by Nebuchadnezzar include the Nar-Shamash, a canal to bring water from the Euphrates close to the city of Sippar, and the Median Wall, a large defensive structure built to defend Babylonia against incursions from the north. The Median Wall was one of two walls built to protect Babylonia's northern border. Further evidence that Nebuchadnezzar believed the north to be the most likely point of attack for his enemies comes from that he fortified the walls of northern cities, such as Babylon, Borsippa and Kish, but left the walls of southern cities, such as Ur and Uruk, as they were. Nebuchadnezzar also began work on the Royal Canal, also known as Nebuchadnezzar's Canal, a great canal linking the Euphrates to the Tigris which in time completely transformed the agriculture of the region, but the structure was not completed until the reign of Nabonidus, who ruled as the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 556 to 539 BC.", "hasanswer": false}]}

From there they intend to drive to Vienna. A sick man in the back seat, who claims to be an Englishman called Flemyng, seems known to an aristocratic Englishwoman, Lady Ashmore, sitting in the front seat. The journey is difficult with diversions and roadblocks, some operated by Soviet troops and others by Hungarian insurgents. At a small lakeside town close to the Austrian border, the passengers are removed from the bus by Major Surov, the local Russian commander. After questioning them and impounding their passports, Surov orders they remain in the town's only hotel. He suspects the ailing Flemyng's passport is not genuine and develops a love interest in the attractive Lady Ashmore. It emerges that Flemyng is a Hungarian insurgent whom Lady Ashmore, his lover, is smuggling to safety. Surov deduces both facts but does not act, hoping that Lady Ashmore will offer herself to him in exchange for safe passage into Austria. Speaking good English, which Surov claims to have learned in Canada, he uses the trapped passengers as a sounding board for his views, arguing that Russians are human too and questioning the imposition of Marxism by military force. However, with Flemyng getting weaker from what is revealed as an untreated gunshot wound, Lady Ashmore bribes a fisherman to take the two of them to Austria, across the lake under cover of darkness. Surov deduces what is happening and captures them both. After getting Flemyng treatment by an army doctor, Surov sends Lady Ashmore back to the hotel. The other passengers are furious that Lady Ashmore jeopardised their release with her selfish behaviour. A pregnant American woman warns Lady Ashmore very frankly what she should do to save them all. Sniping by Hungarians has kept the Russian garrison on edge and a shot wounds Surov's beloved black horse. Unable to euthanise the horse himself, revealing a compassionate side to his nature, Surov orders a sergeant to kill the stricken animal. Lady Ashmore returns, dutifully, prompting Surov, in deep sorrow, to question if she returned willingly. When she truthfully says no, Surov releases Lady Ashmore. In the morning Surov orders the passengers to leave, minus the arrested Flemyng, driving to a quiet spot where they can walk into Austria. As the party crosses the border, Surov turns up with the weakened Flemyng, who he releases to Lady Ashmore. As Surov watches the two disappear, Hungarian bullets kill him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Fink is assigned to a wrestling film by his new boss Jack Lipnick , but he finds difficulty in writing for the unfamiliar subject. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor Charlie Meadows , the source of the noise, visits Fink to apologize. During their conversation, Fink proclaims his affection for \"the common man\", and Meadows describes his life as an insurance salesman. Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Fink consults producer Ben Geisler for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. Fink accidentally meets the novelist W. P. Mayhew in the bathroom. They briefly discuss movie-writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. Fink later learns from Mayhew's secretary, Audrey Taylor , that Mayhew suffers from alcoholism and that Taylor ghostwrote most of his scripts. With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the movie, Fink phones Taylor and begs her for assistance. Taylor visits him at the Earle and they have sex. Fink awakens the next morning to find that Taylor had been violently murdered. Horrified, he summons Meadows and asks for help. Meadows is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Fink to avoid contacting the police. After Fink has a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Meadows announces to Fink that he is going to New York for several days, and asks him to watch over a package he is leaving behind. Soon afterwards, Fink is visited by two police detectives, who inform him that Meadows's real name is Karl \"Madman\" Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer whose modus operandi is beheading his victims. Stunned, Fink places the box on his desk without opening it and he begins writing feverishly. Fink produces the entire script in one sitting and he goes out for a night of celebratory dancing. Fink returns to find the detectives in his room, who inform him of Mayhew's murder and accuse Fink of complicity with Mundt. As the hotel is suddenly engulfed in flames, Mundt appears and kills the detectives with a shotgun, after which he mentions that he had paid a visit to Fink's parents and uncle in New York. Fink leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer. In a final meeting with Lipnick, Fink's script is lambasted as \"a fruity movie about suffering\", and he is informed that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Fink will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes until he \"grows up a little\".

This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased . In the story, the Doctor encounters both the Master and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series. Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by \"Time Crash\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor Peter Davison. A set of two mini-episodes, titled \"Space\" and \"Time\" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event. During Children in Need 2011, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need.

{"id": "164_927", "question": "Who was the producer of Black and White?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_17827", "text": "Shaft played a crucial part in the development of African-American advancement in Hollywood. In the creation of Shaft, there was a significant African-American presence, with director Parks, editor Hugh A. Robertson, and musical composer Isaac Hayes playing crucial roles. On the other hand, white men controlled the other important aspects of Shaft'''s production. Scenarist and writer Tidyman, writer Black, producer Freeman, and executive producers Silliphant and Lewis were all white men who heavily influenced the making of Shaft. In an analysis of Shaft, Stanly Corkin stated, \"Further, the reception of the idea of blackness also becomes various, defined by any number of subject positions, and again, those cannot be fixed to any particular racially defined place of origin.\" In other words, the perception of race depends on the viewer and thus differs between individuals. Since different representations of race appeal to different people, the film's white creators fabricated its representation of blackness in order to appeal to African American and white audiences alike. MGM was struggling financially during the making of this film, so making a profitable film was a necessity. \"Under the devious guise of providing the Black American with a new and positive image of his/her life, these films confer upon the viewer, Black or White, little more than a pretended glamour and sophistication, the empty, repetitive wasteland of ancient Hollywood traditionalism.\" Parks' decision to cast Roundtree rather than a white actor, for whom the role was written, instantly altered the presentation of race in the film. Critics, however, believed the plot was not altered enough to accommodate the change in racial dynamics. \"Mark Reid, for example, argues that Shaft is a product of the studio imagination and merely a 'black-skinned replica' of the white action hero commonly found in the detective genre.\" One way that Shaft's blackness was showcased was through his attire. Shaft was \"stylistically racialized: [He] wears clothes and affects manners that are associated with being black\". Shaft was known for his elegant garb, as he was frequently draped in leather coats and turtlenecks throughout the film. Although his smooth, classy look evoked a greater interest from viewers, it in no way represented fashion typical of the black community in that era. Further, Shaft relies upon a group of militant black nationalists in helping him complete his mission to save Bumpy's daughter. The inclusion of a group so strongly identified with the Black Power movement was clearly an effort to appeal to black audience members. However, the film presented the black nationalists as a group that failed to further the black cause, raised no awareness of the black struggle, and displayed them simply as a hired team of assailants to assist Shaft on his mission. The filming of Shaft partly in the neighborhood of Harlem also allowed the black viewer to have a deeper connection to this film. The writers portrayed Shaft as a man who clearly had a good relationship with this neighborhood, yet rejected it once he became wealthy, moving to the predominantly white area of Greenwich Village. Traditional black thought in this era was that African Americans who had been prosperous financially should invest in and give back to the communities from which they came. Instead, \"the implication is that the wise black will want to sever ties with the people of Harlem and find a place among whites.\" This point further indicates the false portrayal of race in Shaft, as a true black action hero of his time period would have been more loyal to his neighborhood. The result of this inauthentic portrayal of blackness in early 1970s blaxploitation films like Shaft had an effect on black audiences viewing them. Instead of the collective nature of the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movement in the 1960s, these films helped to usher in a decade of self-indulgence, material gain, and drug consumption. \"Equally important, Riley points out that the narratives about, and images of, blacks in these new films are no more than thematic templates reworked with black casts and updated stereotypes that reconfirm white expectations of blacks and serve to repress and delay the awakening of any real political consciousness.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Dardano and Bava took their 25-page treatment for the film to producer Fabrizio De Angelis, who wanted to use footage from Lucio Fulci's films as the film within a film to cut costs. The two would also take the treatment to Luciano Martino who suggested the two to produce the film themselves.  Meanwhile, Dario Argento, who was fresh from the financial success of Phenomena and was beginning to be interested in producing films as he had done previously with Dawn of the Dead. Argento began looking for films to produce, first reading a science fiction script from Luigi Cozzi which he was not convinced with, and then meeting with Bava who agreed to produce Demons. Sacchetti was not content with Argento's suggestions for the script, later stating that Argento brought in Franco Ferrini who he felt only tried to please Argento. Ferrini stated his contributions to the script was to post-pone the appearance of the demons, which he said originally appeared much earlier in the film. Sacchetti then said Argento paid him and had him leave the project, only to invite him back towards the end to give the script a final polish. Sacchetti later remarked that the first half of the film's story was the same as the original script while the second half had more blood and gore and special effect scenes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He would go on to say \"Nine was the thing I really desperately wanted to write\u2014never thinking for a minute that it would ever be produced.

Berwin's rights to The Price of Salt expired in 2010, and Karlsen thereafter acquired the script. Berwin remained an executive producer on the film. Karlsen managed to convince Highsmith's estate to sign over the rights, closing the deal with Tessa Ross in late 2011. She then persuaded a disillusioned and reluctant Nagy to come back on board. The producers hired a UK director, who then dropped out because of scheduling conflicts. They later recruited Irish director John Crowley, who was announced in May 2012 along with the lead cast, Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska, and the involved producers, Karlsen and Stephen Woolley of Number 9 Films and Tessa Ross of Film4, who received executive producer credit. Carol was scheduled to commence filming in early 2013, until Crowley withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. Karlsen called Vachon to discuss losing another director, and Vachon told her that Haynes's new film was not going to happen because its star had also backed out. They then decided to approach Haynes. Vachon, Haynes's frequent collaborator, asked if he would be interested, and he received a copy of the screenplay. Two days later he committed to direct, and Vachon joined as a producer. Haynes was announced as director on May 22, 2013. Three days later, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights at the Cannes Film Festival from HanWay Films. Haynes had first heard about the film in 2012 from costume designer Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her company Dirty Films, had been involved with the project for \"a long time\". Haynes learned that they were looking for a director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett, as motivations to get involved. \"What was so interesting to me when I first read this script\", he said, \"is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind.\" Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level. Another complication emerged when Wasikowska had to drop out because of a scheduling conflict. Haynes then approached Rooney Mara, who had been offered the role of Therese after completing the 2011 film The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She said that although she loved the script and wanted to work with Blanchett, she turned it down because she was exhausted and unconfident. By the time Haynes came on board she was \"in a much different head space\" and signing on was then \"a no-brainer\". In August 2013, it was reported that Mara had replaced Wasikowska. Sarah Paulson was cast as Abby and Kyle Chandler as Harge in January 2014. The next month, Cory Michael Smith was cast as Tommy and Jake Lacy as Richard. In April 2014, John Magaro was cast as Dannie. Carrie Brownstein then joined the cast as Genevieve Cantrell. Carter Burwell was hired to compose the music, and Edward Lachman, who had previously collaborated with Haynes, served as director of photography. In rehearsal, Haynes, Blanchett and Mara realized that certain lines should be cut, which Haynes deemed the \"stylistic practice that we all took throughout the creative departments. I feel there was an understanding with them that words and dialogue were never carrying the weight of the story.\" Costume designer Sandy Powell said of working with Haynes, \"Todd is super visual, super prepared and he provides his own visuals at the beginning of the film. He starts with a look book of images that he's compiled over the months and months. He's almost OCD about it. In a good way.\" The film's look was influenced by the postwar color photography of Ruth Orkin, Esther Bubley, Helen Levitt, and Vivian Maier, as well as the abstract photography of Saul Leiter. Haynes used their work as a visual reference for depicting a \"dirty and sagging\" New York. In preparing for filming, the producers found that the cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive, and it was also going to be difficult to find locations there that resembled the early 1950s. Part of the financing plan hinged upon a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a rethink. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades, with Ohio also having one of the best film tax incentives in the U.S. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many locals as crew.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Most work proceeded with three producers in three different studios with Jackson. Bottrell co-wrote and produced \"Give In to Me\" and \"Black or White\", and received writing credits for \"Dangerous\" and production credits for \"Who Is It\". He had been forced out of the production of Bad by Jones, but Jackson brought him back for Dangerous, for which he was known as the \"rock guy\". Bottrell introduced Jackson to classically trained keyboardist Brad Buxer, who was originally hired as a technician for his expertise in electronic equipment. Buxer recalled, \"Musically speaking, we were on the same wavelength; we spoke the same language.\" The Jackson-Buxer partnership continued for 20 years. For most of the rhythm tracks, Jackson worked with Loren at Westlake Studios. Their work had begun at the end of Jackson's Bad tour, and together they recorded \"Work That Body\", \"She Got It\", \"Serious Effect\", \"Do Not Believe It\", \"Seven Digits\", and \"Man in Black\". Loren wanted to recapture the organic R&B feeling of Jackson's albums Off the Wall and Thriller. LL Cool J was invited to rap on \"Serious Effect\" and \"Truth about Youth\", because Jackson wanted to add hip-hop to the record. LL Cool J had been critical of Jackson but praised him after their collaboration. None of Loren's recordings made the album. Though Loren's material was strong, it was not up to Jackson's standards, and he was searching for a newer sound that would be as compelling as Rhythm Nation by his sister Janet Jackson. Jackson discovered new jack swing, a more aggressive and urban sound, after reaching out to new jack swing producers Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid and Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds. In June 1990, Jackson hired Teddy Riley, pioneer of the new jack swing genre. By then, Jackson had already recorded over 50 songs. Initially recording at Record One, Riley moved to nearby Larrabee Studios after a few weeks, because other producers were working at the Sherman Oaks Studio. Unlike Loren, Riley wanted Dangerous to sound different from Jackson's earlier work, and Jackson admired Riley for bringing in newer styles. Jackson challenged Riley to create new instrumentals without relying on stock synth and drum machine sound. Riley reworked some of Loren's work such as \"She Got It\" and \"Serious Effect\", and continued work on \"Jam\" and \"Dangerous\". \"Dangerous\" was originally recorded with Bottrell, but Jackson was not satisfied until improvements were made. Riley said he brought Jackson's music back to its \"barest forms\" of R&B and funk. By early 1991, Jackson had finished the track list, which included several tracks he recorded with Riley: \"Remember the Time\", \"Dangerous\", and \"In the Closet\". For \"In the Closet\", Jackson had planned a duet with Madonna. Her half of the duet was replaced with Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco. A meeting with guitarist Slash took more than a year to coordinate, and the two collaborated on \"Give In to Me\". Swedien recalled recording sessions lasting up to 18 hours. On one occasion, he ordered Jackson not to leave the studio until he sang the vocals for \"Keep the Faith\" all the way through: \"This was scary but he did it. He didn't leave the studio until dawn.\" Jackson spent $10 million to record Dangerous. Executives at Epic set a deadline for the album, wanting it released before November 28, 1991, Thanksgiving Day. For the last two months of recording, Jackson and Swedien rented hotel rooms located four minutes from Record One, so they could get back to work as soon as possible. Riley said, \"When the deadline came, [Jackson] wanted to do more and more songs. [...] And then when Michael saw the commercial for Dangerous, the David Lynch thing, we started working hard to get it finished.\" Dangerous was completed and mastered, by Bernie Grundman, on Halloween, 1991. Jackson recorded roughly 60 to 70 songs for Dangerous, some of which were released later, including the environmental anthem \"Earth Song\". \"Superfly Sister,\" \"Ghosts\" and \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" were released in the remix compilation Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix. Loren helped develop \"Superfly Sister\", while Riley worked on \"Ghosts\" and \"Blood on the Dance Floor\". \"For All Time,\" a romantic pop ballad that Jackson liked but did not feel it fit Dangerous, was released in the 25th anniversary edition of Thriller. \"Slave to the Rhythm\" was remastered and released for the 2014 compilation album Xscape.

They had each written episodes of the series separately with Friedman credited for \"Rajiin\". Black has several credits to his name on the show, including \"First Flight\" and \"Carbon Creek\". The episode saw the return of John Cothran Jr., who had previously played two Klingons in previously Star Trek series.

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times panned the film, writing, \"Not only is this screen translation of a novel by Richard Sale about a cheapskate Hollywood actor who tries to bludgeon his way to an Academy Award a piece of expensive claptrap, loaded with harrowing clich\u00e9s, but it also is shamelessly endorsed by the presence of some of the great and near great of Hollywood.\" Variety noted that the filmmakers \"make handsome use of the Hollywood background as setting for a narrative some may accept as typical of the Oscar race and others may not accept at all.\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote that like executive producer Joseph E.

The first game in the series, Paper Mario, was launched in 2000 on the Nintendo 64 to critical and commercial success. In the Paper Mario series, the player controls Mario in a mixture of 3D environments and 2D characters who look as if they are made of paper. Mario can jump and use his hammer to overcome physical obstacles placed in the game's overworld. Additionally, the player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations, who each have a specialized skill required for progression in the game. These characters assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles. Damage inflicted to the player reduces the amount of HP. Attacks in the game are similar to those in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his partners have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points in combat to level up. Progression through Paper Mario depends upon interaction with the game's non-player characters , who will often offer clues or detail the next event in the storyline. As in other RPGs, the player can find or purchase items from NPCs to help in and outside of combat. Badges can be obtained that yield bonuses ranging from added moves to gradual health restoration during combat; each consumes a set number of Badge Points , meaning Mario can only equip a limited number of badges at a time. There have been five Paper Mario games released for home consoles and one game on 3DS. As the series has progressed, each new game has introduced new elements in order to keep the gameplay fresh such as a new story, new partners, and new gameplay mechanics. In 2004, The Thousand-Year Door for the GameCube introduced the ability of Mario turning into and folding up into a paper airplane and/or a paper boat to interact with the overworld. In 2007, Super Paper Mario deviated into the 2D action RPG genre and introduced the ability to \"flip\" into a 3D perspective in which the level rotates to reveal a hidden z-axis, placing Mario in a 3D environment. In 2012, Sticker Star for the Nintendo 3DS introduced the use of stickers in both the environment and in turn-based battles. They can be found and peeled off from various areas in the overworld, and can be purchased or received from non-playable characters. In 2015, Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam also for the 3DS where all the Paper Mario world enters the real one.

Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter in his directorial debut, and executive produced by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton. The film centers on two monsters James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc., which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when a little human girl sneaks into the factory, she must be returned home before it's too late. Docter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon and Ralph Eggleston. Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Daniel Gerson.

While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device \"in a way we never have before and never will again\" and while promoting \"The Constant\", he said that it \"upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it.\" Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in \"Flashes Before Your Eyes\"\u2014although, Lindelof has said that \"The Constant\" is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show\u2014by Ms. Hawking , who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. The writers hoped that \"The Constant\" would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. Lindelof reminisced that \"just breaking that episode was such a massive headache\" and Cuse added that \"it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week\". Cuse and Lindelof admitted they took some inspiration from the final episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, \"All Good Things...\", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as \"someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist\". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction\u2014as Lindelof put it, \"He's our Doc Brown here, who basically is gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past\". Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, \"The Constant\" took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories. Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Lost's rules. Michio Kaku claimed that \"the show's producers did their homework\". According to Kaku, \"there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel\u2014just a lack of know-how\u00a0\u2026\u00a0[but] it would take a very advanced civilization to really do this\". Cuse stated that \"we [the writers] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility\". \"The Constant\" was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information\u2014Lindelof has declared that \"you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were in a constant state of crisis\". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew. Shooting occurred in the second half of October 2007. The scenes on the freighter in this and later episodes were filmed for several days on a freighter ten to fifteen minutes off the west coast of Oahu, Hawaii, where Lost is filmed. Instead of docking the ship and returning to the ocean each day, the actors and crew slept on the freighter in areas that were not being used for filming. The Oxford scenes were shot at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu. In 1996, Desmond has short hair and no facial hair and in 2004, Desmond sports long and untamed hair with a full beard. Cusick did not cut his hair; it was hidden underneath a short-haired wig by \"really talented hair and makeup folks\", according to Carlton Cuse. All freighter scenes were shot before Cusick shaved most of his beard for the 1996 scenes. A fake beard was glued onto Cusick for the episodes \"Ji Yeon\" and \"Meet Kevin Johnson\" while his beard grew back. The equations on Faraday's chalkboard were written by a physicist who was hired as a consultant by the producers. The way the transitions between the 1996 and 2004 scenes would take place was frequently discussed during production. The producers took the advice of editor Mark Goldman, who suggested sudden cuts with \"no fancy effect, and in some cases, no sound cut\", similar to the way \"All Good Things...\" was edited. The original ending would set up the following episode by having Charlotte drop a bag containing a gas mask at Faraday's feet. But the producers thought it did not work after the emotional scenes between Desmond and Penny, and decided to finish with Faraday reading his diary. Jeremy Davies, who plays Daniel Faraday, said \"I thought it was a remarkably well-written and brilliantly conceived story. I was quite knocked out by it on a lot of levels.\" He called it \"remarkable storytelling.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Picking up where the 2007 film ended and then jumping ahead two years, Halloween II follows Laurie Strode as she deals with the aftermath of the previous film's events, Dr. Loomis who is trying to capitalize on those events by publishing a new book that chronicles everything that happened, and Michael Myers as he continues his search for Laurie so that he can reunite with his sister. The film sees the return of lead cast members from the 2007 film Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, and Tyler Mane, who portray Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers, respectively. For Halloween II, Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Strode and Myers, and the idea that they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. He wanted to portray how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film. Halloween II was officially released on August 28, 2009 in North America, and was met with a negative reception from critics.

Variety praised the performances of the cast, remarking that as Ziegfeld, William Powell \"endows the impersonation with all the qualities of a great entrepreneur and sentimentalist without sacrificing the shades and moods called for\" and noting that Luise Rainer is \"tops of the femmes with her vivacious Anna Held\". Stanley Green cited The Great Ziegfeld as \"the first of a number of elaborate show-business screen biographies\". Otis Ferguson, writing for New Republic magazine, remarked that the \"musical numbers seem as irresistible as Ziegfeld himself\". The New York American said that the film is \"pretty nearly everything such an extravaganza should be\", with \"romance and reality, song and dance, gaiety and beauty, pathos and bathos\". Time qualified it as \"Pretentious, packed with hokum and as richly sentimental as an Irving Berlin lyric, it is, as such, top-notch entertainment.\" A reviewer for the Spokane Chronicle praised the film for its superb acting, writing that \"[even] the great producer [Ziegfeld] would have been unable to produce scenes of magnitude and splendor that are given as part of the picture telling his life.\" Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times was also highly praising of the film, noting that it had \"more stars than there are in the heavens\" and remarking that \"the picture achieves its best moments in the larger sequences devoted to the Girls \u2014 ballet, chorus and show. At least one of these spectacular numbers, filmed to the music of Irving Berlin's \"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody\", with overtones of \"Rhapsody in Blue\", never has been equaled on the musical comedy stage or screen.\" John Mosher of The New Yorker called it \"the most lavish display the screen has had to offer\" with chorus numbers that were \"gigantic and effective\", though he found the romance to be \"peculiarly average screen-story stuff.\" Both The New York Times and Film Daily rated the film in the \"Ten Best\" of the year. However, not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film; Graham Greene of the British Spectator called it a \"huge inflated gas-blown object\" and criticized its length, comparing it to the feat of a flagpole sitter. A number of critics, although praising the film in general, felt that Myrna Loy, who appears rather late on in the film, gave a lackluster performance as Billie Burke. Nugent said that \"Miss Loy is a stately Bille Burke, and somewhat lacking, we fear, in Miss Burke's effervescence and gaiety\", and Cecilia Agner thought she came across as \"stilted, like her rigidly waxed and set blonde wig\". Harrison Carroll] of the Los Angeles Herald-Express, however, sympathized with the difficulty of her role in portraying a prominent living actress, confessing that he was pleased that Loy did not attempt to imitate Burke's mannerisms. Emily W. Leider believes that any of her character flaws were due to a \"mushy\" script, rather than her performance as an actress.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the third track from their 1993 album Zooropa and was released in June 1993 as the album's first single. The song features a monotonous mantra of \"don't\" commands spoken by guitarist the Edge amidst a backdrop of various sound effects and samples. The noisy composition and lyrical concept for \"Numb\" were inspired by the theme of sensory overload, which had prominently been incorporated into the Zoo TV Tour. Lead singer Bono and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. provided backing vocals on the track. \"Numb\" originated as a discarded song from the Achtung Baby recording sessions called \"Down All the Days\". While recording Zooropa, the band transformed the song with mixing assistance from co-producer Flood, the addition of keyboards and samples by co-producer Brian Eno, and the addition of the Edge's monotone vocals. The song was released as a VHS single, featuring music videos directed by Kevin Godley and Emergency Broadcast Network, respectively, but it did not attain widespread commercial success. U2 added \"Numb\" to their live set lists after resuming their Zoo TV Tour in May 1993, but like most songs on Zooropa it has never been performed live since the end of that tour.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_962", "question": "Who was the producer of The Birds?", "ctxs": [{"id": "472_29985", "text": "The Great Zimbabwe Bird first appeared in an armorial sense when it was incorporated in the coat of arms of Southern Rhodesia, which were granted by Royal Warrant on 11 August 1924. It was first used on a national flag when the full arms were displayed on the Rhodesian flag that was adopted on 11 November 1968. It then appeared alone on the Zimbabwe Rhodesian flag of 1979, and it is now displayed on the flag of Zimbabwe. The arms of 1924 were initially retained by the Zimbabwean Government until a new coat of arms  were adopted on 12 September 1981. Anyone who has been to Zimbabwe or seen a photograph of a Zimbabwean flag made in Zimbabwe will notice that the Zimbabwe Bird is rendered in the same format as it appeared on the arms of 1924 and as it appeared on the Rhodesian flag of 1968 and the Zimbabwe Rhodesian flag of 1979. They will also notice that the red star on which the bird is placed is a regular star. However, a different, rather flattened version of the bird, sometimes displayed on an irregular, flattened star, is often seen on flags that are manufactured outside of Zimbabwe. The origin of this discrepancy appears to be an illustration of the proposed new flag that was first released by the Zimbabwe Ministry of Information in April 1980, just prior to the country attaining full independence. This illustration showed the bird in a flattened version positioned over an irregular star. The poor quality of the illustration, with the star appearing as irregular on the flag, but regular under the description of the meanings on the right, and with the Zimbabwe Bird being omitted completely from where it should be next to the words The National Emblem, would suggest that it was done in haste and without accuracy. Nevertheless, in the absence of a better source, vexillologists outside of Zimbabwe have used this illustration as the basis for their rendering of the emblem on the flag, which has then been copied by many flag manufacturers outside of Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, flag manufacturers inside Zimbabwe continue to produce flags emblazoned with the original version of the bird sitting on a regular star. As a result, there are now two versions of the bird and star - the flattened one and the regular one.  Since the flag is the national flag of Zimbabwe, it should surely follow that the version as produced and used in the country itself should be regarded the official version.", "hasanswer": false}]}

New York was then a centre of punk rock and what would come to be known as new wave, and Fripp became part of the scene, playing and recording with Blondie and the Roche sisters, absorbing the sounds of the active downtown music scene. He envisioned a new approach, and incorporated elements of these NYC experiences into his current palette, including \"Frippertronics\", the tape-delay/looping technique he had developed with Brian Eno. At Eno's invitation, Fripp performed on David Bowie's \"Heroes\" single and album in 1977. Originally, Fripp envisioned Exposure as the third part of a simultaneous trilogy also comprising Daryl Hall's Sacred Songs and Peter Gabriel's second album aka Scratch, both of which Fripp contributed to and produced. Fripp's aim with the trilogy \"was to investigate the 'pop song' as a means of expression. I think it's an incredibly good way of putting forward ideas. I think it's a supreme discipline to know that you have three to four minutes to get together all your lost emotions and find words of one syllable or less to put forward all your ideas. It's a discipline of form that I don't think is cheap or shoddy\". The album was to be originally titled The Last Great New York Heartthrob and feature a track list configuration different from that of the final release. Hall's management and label resisted the project, fearing the music would damage Hall's commercial appeal, insisting as well that Exposure be equally credited to Hall, initially Fripp's main vocalist. Fripp instead used only two Hall vocals on his album, substituting Peter Hammill and Terre Roche in various places. The trilogy did not work out as intended, although all the albums were released. \"Urban Landscape\" appears on the Hall album, as does \"NYCNY\" . The Gabriel record also features a version of \"Exposure\". \"Here Comes the Flood\" had previously appeared with a prog-rock arrangement on Gabriel's first album, but Gabriel disliked the production, and created a simpler rendition of the song for Exposure. Fripp stated in the liner notes that Exposure \"is indebted to all those who took part in the hazardous series of events culminating in this record, and several who do not appear but who helped determine the final shape: Tim Cappella, Alirio Lima, Ian McDonald and John Wetton\". The version of the album that was released, after the changes and compromises that had to be made, was reconceptualized as part of a new trilogy, \"The Drive to 1981\", marking the beginning of three-year campaigns by Fripp as a professional musician, which would include an album of Frippertronics and one of \"Discotronics\", to be released between September 1979 and September 1980. Both album concepts were released together as God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners, with each concept getting its own followup\uff0dThe League of Gentlemen for Discotronics and Let the Power Fall for Frippertronics, making for a five-step trilogy. The end of The Drive to 1981 marked the beginning of \"the incline to 1984\", Fripp's tenure with a reformed King Crimson, originally intended as Discipline. Fripp's tour to support Exposure was strictly a solo tour, utilizing only his own electric guitar and Frippertronics, and included then unorthodox rock music venues such as restaurants and retail outlets.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_967", "question": "Who was the producer of Doubt?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_22626", "text": "Formation, early years and line-up changes Eric Stefani and John Spence met at a Dairy Queen, and talked about getting a group together to play music. Stefani acquired a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice; these included himself , his sister Gwen Stefani , John Spence , Jerry McMahon , Chris Leal , Chris Webb , Gabriel Gonzalez , Alan Meade , and Tony Meade . They practiced in Eric's parents' garage. Tony Kanal went to one of the band's early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that no one in the band date her. Paul Caseley also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter joined the horn section soon after. The group performed at an Orange High School backyard graduation party on June 6, 1987 with two other California ska bands. At the party, No Doubt's set included \"Total Hate\", \"Too Much Pressure\", \"Danger\", \"Paulina\", \"Gangsters\", and the song \"No Doubt\". Video clips from the party have appeared on VH1's Behind the Music. In December 1987, Spence died by suicide, several days before the band was to play a gig at The Roxy Theatre for record industry employees. No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks with Alan Meade taking over vocals. When Meade left the band, Gwen replaced him as lead singer, and No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California. In early 1988, Tom Dumont left Rising, a heavy metal band of which he was a member with his sister, stating that local metal bands \"were into drinking, wearing Spandex\" but that he wanted to focus on music. He joined No Doubt and replaced Jerry McMahon as the band's guitarist. Adrian Young replaced Chris Webb as their drummer the following year. During this time period, No Doubt played gigs at local colleges, Fender's Grand Ballroom, The Whisky, The Roxy, many shows with The Untouchables, Fishbone, and a show with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Cal State Long Beach. Caseley left No Doubt in July 1989 for the US Navy Band. Self-titled debut album Impressed by the presence of stage diving fans at No Doubt's concerts and Gwen's on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created Interscope Records in 1990. No Doubt's self-titled debut album was finally released in 1992, but it featured no radio singles, although a video was made for \"Trapped in a Box\". The album's distinctly upbeat pop/cartoon sound sharply contrasted with the then-dominant grunge movement. Owing to the music world's direct focus on grunge, No Doubt's album was not supported by the record label, and was considered a commercial failure for selling only 30,000 copies. The band embarked on a national tour in support of the album, though Interscope refused to support the tour. The band failed to bring the audiences that it had attracted in southern California, and often found that No Doubt was not even available in the cities where it was playing. Eric Stefani began to withdraw from the group, vacillating between being in and out of the band. Reorganization and career breakthrough The band began work on its next album the next year, but Interscope rejected much of its material, and the band was paired with producer Matthew Wilder. Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording and rehearsing. He left No Doubt in 1994 to resume an animation career with the cartoon TV series The Simpsons. Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen, saying that he needed \"space\". Unsure of what to do with the band, Interscope sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1993. No Doubt released The Beacon Street Collection, consisting of outtakes from its previous recording sessions, in 1995 on its own label, Beacon Street Records. Mixing 1980s punk rock and some grunge influences into the band's sound, the album contains a rawer sound than No Doubt, and it sold more than three times as many copies as its predecessor. Later that year, Trauma Records released Tragic Kingdom, much of which dealt with the relationship between Tony Kanal and Gwen Stefani. The release of 1995's Tragic Kingdom and the single \"Just a Girl\" allowed the group to achieve mainstream commercial success. No Doubt began touring in support of the album late that year, and it grew into a 27-month international tour. In 1996, the second single, \"Spiderwebs\", was successful, and \"Don't Speak\", a ballad written by Gwen and Eric Stefani about Gwen and Kanal's break-up, was released as the third single and broke the previous record when it topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay for sixteen weeks. No Doubt was nominated for two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album at the 1997 Grammy Awards. By the end of the year, half of the songs on Tragic Kingdom had been released as singles, and the album was certified eight times platinum. Later, they were nominated for two more Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, both for \"Don't Speak\". The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album diamond in February 1999, and with worldwide sales of sixteen million. Through the success of Tragic Kingdom, the band's self-titled debut album began again to sell copies, and reached total sales of over a quarter of a million copies. The album's release fueled a dispute between Trauma and Interscope Records over No Doubt's recording contract. Trauma sued for US$100 million for breach of contract, fraud, and extortion and sought to have its joint venture agreement ended, claiming that Interscope had reneged on its contract after the band had become more successful than expected. No Doubt had previously stated that it had switched to Trauma Records and that the transition was \"really great...because now we have the attention and the focus of a small indie label.\" The case was settled out of court with a $3 million payment. Continued touring and new albums The band finished its tour in December 1997 and had several releases during the two-year writing process to make its follow-up to Tragic Kingdom. Live in the Tragic Kingdom, a live long-form video of the band's performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, was released and The Beacon Street Collection was re-released while the band was on tour that year. The band recorded \"I Throw My Toys Around\" with Elvis Costello for The Rugrats Movie, and it contributed to The Clash's tribute album Burning London: The Clash Tribute. Stefani began to make recordings without the band, contributing vocals to tracks for The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Prince, Fishbone & Familyhood Nextperience, and her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale's band Bush. After some time in-between albums, No Doubt included its song \"New\" on the soundtrack to the movie Go in 1999. \"New\", inspired by Gwen's budding relationship with Rossdale, was one of the first songs written after the release of Tragic Kingdom. In 2000, the band released Return of Saturn, its follow-up to Tragic Kingdom. The album featured a darker tone and was more lyrically advanced than No Doubt's previous work. The main lyrical focus of the new record had shifted from Gwen Stefani's relationship with bassist Tony Kanal to her new relationship with Gavin Rossdale. Return of Saturn was critically acclaimed, but was not as commercially successful as their previous album, and the lead single, \"Ex-Girlfriend\", failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Also released as singles from the album were the tracks \"Simple Kind of Life\" and \"Bathwater\". Lukewarm sales drastically shortened the tour that followed, appearing only in festival settings in L.A., Cincinnati, Nashville, Jacksonville and Miami. On August 10, No Doubt went on VH1 Storytellers and performed a few of their songs, and were joined by friend Alain Johannes and former member Eric Stefani. After Return of Saturn, the band returned to recording in January 2001. During this time, it contributed a cover version of Donna Summer's \"Love to Love You Baby\" for the Zoolander soundtrack and recorded a song with Kelis for her album Wanderland. Stefani made high-profile appearances on Moby's \"South Side\" and Eve's \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\". These appearances lent No Doubt credibility and an opportunity to explore new genres. Highly influenced by Jamaican dancehall music and recorded primarily in Jamaica, the band's 2001 studio album, Rock Steady, produced two hit Grammy-winning singles, \"Hey Baby\", which featured Bounty Killer, and \"Underneath It All\", which featured the first lady of dancehall, Lady Saw. Both singles managed to reach the top five on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also released \"Hella Good\" and \"Running\" as singles. In addition, pop-star Prince co-wrote, produced, and performed on \"Waiting Room\" from Rock Steady. Stefani had previously provided vocals for a song on Prince's Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic album, \"So Far, So Pleased\". In November 2002, No Doubt made an appearance in the Dawson's Creek episode \"Spiderwebs\". Greatest-hits album and first hiatus In January 2003, No Doubt performed in the Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show. 2003 was a big year of releases for No Doubt. The album The Singles 1992\u20132003, a compilation of the band's commercially released singles, was released on November 25, 2003. It included a cover of the song \"It's My Life\", which had originally been a hit for synthpop group Talk Talk in 1984, and earned No Doubt a Grammy nomination for Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal. Additionally, a special 2-CD 2-DVD box set titled Boom Box was made available, which included the CDs The Singles 1992\u20132003 and Everything in Time and the DVDs The Videos 1992\u20132003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom. Separately, Rock Steady Live, a DVD of the band performing in Long Beach from their Rock Steady tour was released in 2003 as well. The next year, the band was featured in a re-recording of the Toots and the Maytals classic song \"Monkey Man\". The band also toured with Blink-182 in mid-2004, before embarking on a hiatus. Lead singer Gwen Stefani began work on her 1980s-inspired new wave and dance-pop side project in 2003, which eventually evolved into the full-fledged solo album Love. Angel. Music. Baby., released on November 23, 2004. The album reached multi-platinum status in several countries, including a quintuple platinum certification in Canada and triple platinum in the US. No Doubt was featured on the album True Love by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites. Stefani launched her first solo arena tour in October 2005, which coincided with the news of her pregnancy . She released her second solo dance-pop album, The Sweet Escape in December 2006. In early 2005, Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord, with friend and collaborator Ted Matson, and backed up Matt Costa on his 2005 tour. Adrian Young, the band's drummer, did the drums for Bow Wow Wow's 2004 tour and many of the tracks on Unwritten Law's 2005 release Here's to the Mourning, as well as featuring on several shows in 2006 for TheStart. Young also played on Rock Star: Supernova runner-up Dilana's Inside Out album. In 2008, Tony Kanal collaborated with pop rock artist Pink on the album Funhouse. Kanal co-produced \"Sober\", co-wrote \"Funhouse\" and also sang back-up vocals on \"Crystal Ball\". Reunion and comeback tour With Stefani promoting her second solo album, No Doubt began initial work on a new album without her and planned to complete it after Stefani's tour was finished. However, songwriting was slow as Gwen Stefani was, at the time, pregnant with her second child. The album was produced by Mark \"Spike\" Stent, who helped produce and mix Rock Steady. No Doubt announced on their official website that they would tour in the summer of 2009 with Paramore, The Sounds, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Bedouin Soundclash, Katy Perry, Panic! at the Disco, and Matt Costa, all while finishing their upcoming album, which was set for release in 2010. As a special promotion for the tour, the band was giving away their entire music catalog free as a digital download with purchase of top-tier seating. The band released another compilation album on November 2 called Icon, in preparation for their upcoming comeback album. Icon featured the same track listing as their previous compilation album The Singles 1992\u20132003 albeit with new artwork and a low price point. On June 11, 2012, the band announced on their official website that the new album would be out on September 25, preceded by the first single on July 16. The album was titled Push and Shove and the first single was a song called \"Settle Down\". The music video for \"Settle Down\" was directed by Sophie Muller . \"Settle Down\" peaked at #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 with the album peaking at #3. On November 3, 2012, the band pulled its music video \"Looking Hot\" from the Internet after receiving complaints that it was insensitive towards Native Americans. As of February 1, 2013, the band stated via Twitter that they had \"Finished a week of songwriting\", implying that they have more new tracks written. As of February 26, 2013, the band officially confirmed through their website that they had indeed begun working on new music as well as plans for an upcoming tour. Second hiatus, continued tour and future projects In October 2013 Tom revealed on social networking site Twitter that the band was once again on hiatus, also hinting that the band will regroup in 2014. No Doubt performed at the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park on September 27, 2014. They also announced via Twitter that they would perform at Rock in Rio USA in May 2015. With the release of Gwen Stefani's solo single \"Baby Don't Lie\", she announced that No Doubt were working on a new album. However, during an interview with the Orange County Register in April 2015, Tony Kanal stated that the band was not working on any new material. No Doubt performed at several events during 2015, including Global Citizen Earth Day Concert, Rock In Rio USA, and was expected to perform at Jazz Aspen Snowmass, in Colorado, Riot Fest and Carnival in Chicago, and Kaaboo in Del Mar, California. In a June 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty over the future of No Doubt. \"I don't know what's going to happen with No Doubt. When Tony [Kanal] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [2012's Push and Shove]. And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all waited that long to put something out and it didn't get heard.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story \u2014usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Some notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired twelve episodes ; almost an entire season of seven-episode serials ; the ten-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for fourteen episodes during season 23. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a story-line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, season 16's quest for the Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy. The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher. However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-orientated episodes, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after The Highlanders . While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: Black Orchid , set in 1920s England. The early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following The Gunfighters , however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers. Of the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the most well known outside Doctor Who itself, due to the popularity of his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy works. The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with what was now called a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes , and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's eighth series, and ten episodes from the  eleventh series. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, often linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early \"classic\" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes \"Journey's End\" from 2008 and \"The Eleventh Hour\" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length. Doctor Who instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes , 45/50-minute episodes , two feature-length productions , twelve Christmas specials , and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a Doctor Who\u2013themed edition of The Proms. The 1993 two-part story, entitled Dimensions in Time, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera EastEnders and was filmed partly on the EastEnders set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief. Starting with the 2009 special \"Planet of the Dead\", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", was broadcast in 2013. In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning, and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide. In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between BBC Worldwide and SMG Pictures in China, the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was picked up by producer David Black, who had produced George M!, and got them booked at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater by the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, but unfortunately, the booking was canceled, supposedly by the director, Robert Montgomery.

The first was the cast album by Capitol Records, produced by Nick Venet, which had begun to do well.

She rents a small room in the home of a gay couple, has a lousy love life and drives a rust bucket of a car that she cannot afford to repair. The car breaks down, blocking the route of a diplomatic convoy that is traveling to the White House. Unsympathetic to Sunny's predicament, the Diplomatic Security Service treat the incident as a possible security threat and move into full security mode, guns drawn. Sunny is naive to the seriousness of her situation, concerned only that she will now be late for work. At the Safari Club where Sunny works, her night is getting worse. Her date cancels and she is forced to wear an emu suit because all of the other costumes are now taken by waitresses who arrived on time. She hates the costume because it invites unwanted sexual propositions. Even though she is \"so broke,\" she refuses an offer from a patron requesting special \"favors\" in return for cash, as well as a loan from a waitress friend, Ella. On her way home, Sunny is curious about the media attention surrounding a gala dinner, so she stops to watch the dignitaries leaving the event. A man of Middle Eastern descent rudely pushes past her. Sunny feels something hard in his coat pocket. She asks if he has a gun. To her horror, he does. A shot is fired, but Sunny prevents him taking aim at his target by biting his arm. In the ensuing commotion, both Sunny and the gunman are forced to the ground and another shot is fired. Sunny cries out, realizing she has been shot. Through news media reports, we learn that Sunny has been taken to the hospital and is being lauded as a heroine. She has prevented the assassination of a visiting Emir, who had been in Washington to further relations between the US and his \"small, but strategic Middle Eastern country\", El Othar. Doctors remove a bullet from Sunny's left buttock. While recovering, she finds herself thrust into public adoration, receiving mail from celebrities and countless marriage proposals. Michael Ransome, a Middle Eastern desk chief from the State Department, pays a visit to help Sunny get through her first press conference since the shooting. Sunny answers each question about her life with humor and charm, revealing herself to be hugely likeable, intelligent and patriotic. She also reveals that she has never voted, preferring to consider herself as just an American, rather than any political label. Back at the White House, politicians Crowe and Hilley are watching the conference. They joke that if Sunny is to be believed, she could run for office because of her appeal to so many large groups of voters, including working women, small town folk, senior citizens, gays, the \"law-and-order bunch,\" baseball fans, bar flys and animal lovers. They contact the President of the United States , and arrange for him to call Sunny at the hospital. The Emir whose life Sunny saved was being wooed by the US, which wants to establish a military base in his country because of its ideal geographic location in the Middle East. He decides that he will allow the US to build its base in his country \u2014 on the proviso that they allow him to claim Sunny as another wife. Without the President's knowledge, the State Department decides to trade Sunny for the base without her knowledge. The Vice President of the United States offers her a job within the Protocol Department of the Government. She has to look up what \"protocol\" means in a dictionary, but when she realizes he is offering her a well-paying job, she accepts. Sunny approaches her new job with nervous excitement, She attends formal dinners and meets dignitaries from foreign countries. At one dinner, she is introduced to Nawaf Al Kabeer, who thanks Sunny on behalf of the Emir, and presents a car to her, as a thank-you gift from the Emir. She returns it, having researched that as a government employee, she is unable to accept gifts. But this act infuriates both the Emir and the State Department. Sunny is unaware that in the Emir's country, the local population is aware that Sunny is to be a new Queen, and anger is growing. Sunny is told that the Emir wants to meet her personally, and that she is to \"show him a good time.\" She looks upon this invitation as a way to help her old boss Lou by arranging a party at his failing Safari Club, where she used to work. Lou has not closed the bar to his regular patrons and Sunny has invited friends of her own. The party gets out of control, the Police make arrests and all of this is filmed by the media. Ambassador St. John sees this as a perfect opportunity to finally make the trade. She tells Sunny to go with the Emir to \"represent her country\" and make amends. Sunny arrives in the Emir's country to find a mural of herself in wedding attire. She realizes it's a set-up, that she was traded so the US could build its base. The Emir confirms this. Unable to produce sons, he needs a new wife. Before an angry Sunny can respond, a violent coup d'\u00e9tat takes place in the Emir's country of Otah, and the two are forced to flee. Back in the US, the government denies knowledge of the trade and the public is now questioning whether Sunny knew all along of the plan. She must also face a Congressional inquiry to find out the truth. Ransome quits his job in disgust at what was done to Sunny. At the inquiry, Sunny cuts the proceedings short by accepting blame, having taken an important job without fully understanding the political affairs of her country. But she reminds everyone that leaders have a responsibility toward the people. She warns the political powers in the room that, from now on, she will watch all of them \"like a hawk.\" Two years later, Sunny has married Ransome and they have a baby. She is also running for Congress in her hometown of Diamond Junction in Oregon, and gets a call telling her that she has won.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Champ attempts to train and to convince promoters to set up a fight for him, but his efforts are consistently stymied by his alcoholism. Dink is repeatedly disappointed and let down by his father's irresponsible actions and frequent broken promises to quit drinking, but his utter devotion to his father nonetheless never wavers. In addition to his drinking problem, Champ is also a compulsive gambler, another vice which he repeatedly promises Dink he will surrender .

Linda and Tony observe Dink and Champ together and realize that Dink is her son. Champ allows Linda to see Dink, who accepts that she is his mother. But Dink feels no emotion toward her, as she has never been part of his life. Linda resolves to remove Dink from the negative atmosphere in which he's growing up and have him live with her family. Catching Champ during an all-night gambling binge, Tony asks him to turn Dink over so that Tony and Linda can put Dink into school. Champ refuses.

LaBeouf was simultaneously doing work for the Disney Channel show Even Stevens, and would work on his role in the film after doing his filming on Even Stevens.

King used the hotel that inspired him to write the book as the miniseries' location, with some interior shots in stages also in Denver. Garris tried to make the hotel feel as \"enclosed\" as possible to add a vibe of claustrophobia when in a closed hotel; the crew did this by emphasizing the \"darkness\" of the hotel, painting some of Stanley's areas that had recently been painted white, brown. The production team began shooting at the Stanley Hotel in March 1996, the date chosen as it was Denver's snowiest month. However, on the day filming began, they realized the hotel as well as most of Estes Park was in a \"snow shadow,\" meaning it garnered the least amount of snow out of all Denver areas. As a result, they spent $100,000 in snowmaking machines sent from Los Angeles while lucking out on \"three or four\" shooting days with actual snow falling on Estes. Producer Mark Carliner attributed the lucky snowfalls to a Ute shaman doing a ritual at the highest peak of the Rocky Mountains. The cast and crew, such as Cynthia Garris, Mick Garris' wife who plays the woman in Room 217; and Dawn Jeffrey-Nelson, Courtland Mead's acting coach claimed paranormal experiences occurring at the hotel during shooting.

When the executive who had signed her left, the label lost interest and she left without releasing the folk songs many of which were written by her father. She then studied horticulture to become a florist, but changed her mind and returned to music. Allen began writing songs, while her manager introduced her to production duo Future Cut in 2004. They worked in a small studio in the basement of an office building. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Recordings; they gave her \u00a325,000 to produce an album, though they were unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases such as X&Y and Demon Days . Allen then created an account on MySpace and began posting demos that she recorded in November 2005. The demos attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7-inch vinyl singles of \"LDN\" were rush-released, reselling for as much as \u00a340. Allen also produced two mixtapes \u2013 My First Mixtape and My Second Mixtape \u2013 to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly , a magazine published in The Observer, took interest in March 2006. Few people outside of her label's A&R department knew who she was, so the label was slow in responding to publications wanting to report about her. She received her first major mainstream coverage, appearing in the magazine's cover story two months later.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Following World War I, a group known as the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement was formed as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in war. Those who were opposed to this stand and refused to participate in the war were declared \"disfellowshipped\" by their local Church leaders at the time. When the Church leaders from the General Conference came and admonished the local European leaders after the war to try to heal the damage, and bring the members together, it met with resistance from those who had suffered under those leaders. Their attempts at reconciliation failed after the war and the group became organized as a separate church at a conference that was held on July 14\u201320, 1925. The movement officially incorporated in 1949. In 2005, in another attempt to examine and resolve what its German leaders had done, the mainstream church apologized for its failures during World War II, stating, we deeply regret' any participation in or support of Nazi activities during the war by the German and Austrian leadership of the church.\" In the Soviet Union the same issues produced the group known as the True and Free Seventh-day Adventists. This also formed as the result of a schism within the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Europe during World War I over the position its European church leaders took on having its members join the military or keep the Sabbath. The group remains active today in the former republics of the Soviet Union. Well known but distant offshoots are the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization and the Branch Davidians, themselves a schism within the larger Davidian movement. The Davidians formed in 1929, following Victor Houteff, after he came out with his book The Shepherd's Rod, which was rejected as heretical. A succession dispute after Houteff's death in 1955 led to the formation of two groups, the original Davidians and the Branches. Later, another ex-Adventist, David Koresh, led the Branch Davidians, until he died in the 1993 siege, at the group's headquarters near Waco, Texas. A number of Adventists who apostatized, such as former ministers Walter Rea and Dale Ratzlaff, have become critics of the church's teachings, and particularly Ellen G. White.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The screenplay by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond is based on a screenplay by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan from the 1935 French film Fanfare of Love. The film is about two musicians who disguise themselves by dressing as women in order to escape from mafia gangsters whom they witnessed committing a crime. Some Like It Hot opened to critical and commercial success and is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, winning for Best Costume Design. In 1989, the Library of Congress selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film was produced without approval from the Motion Picture Production Code , because it features LGBT-related themes, including cross-dressing. The code had been gradually weakening in its scope since the early 1950s, due to greater social tolerance for previously taboo topics in film, but it was still officially enforced until the mid-1960s.

The sisters occasionally appeared together in fantasy sequences. Full House was one of the few shows on TV where a baby character grew up in front of the cameras, with viewers witnessing all the development stages of the twin actresses. Saget recalled he would often get complaints from the child actors' moms because he wouldn't watch his language while on stage. Jodie Sweetin was spotted in a guest spot on the show Valerie.

Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world. Joey's catchphrase, \"How you doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech. Friends has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, BTS member RM and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters. Friends is parodied in the twelfth season Murder, She Wrote episode \"Murder Among Friends.\" In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher investigates the murder of a writer for Buds, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved Murder, She Wrote from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite Friends on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and Murder, She Wrotes supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\" Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of Buds by watching episodes of Friends. Producers of Married... with Children attempted to create a spinoff series called Enemies, which was intended to act as an antithesis to Friends in the same way Married... with Children had been to family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show. However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series. The Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide.

The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by Friends, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses also contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing Friends episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai caf\u00e9, where he worked as a waiter. Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004. From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold real coffee to customers and featured a display of Friends memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football.\" In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.

It was the 16th most popular film at the British box office in 1935\u201336. In 2005, it was nominated for the AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores, a list of the top 25 film scores unveiled by the American Film Institute. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 93%, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.46/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Eerily prescient in its presentation of a dystopian future, Things to Come's special effects may be somewhat dated, but its potent ideas haven't aged at all\". Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mixed review. Although he made it clear that \"a third of the film is magnificent\", he felt that the second third seemed implausible, and began to lose interest with the introduction of the \"Great Conspiracy\" in the last third of the film. The optimism and idealism comes off as naive for him. Science fiction historian Gary Westfahl has stated: \"Things to Come qualifies as the first true masterpiece of science fiction cinema, and those who complain about its awkward pace and uninvolving characters are not understanding Wells's message, which is that the lives and actions of individuals are unimportant when compared to the progress and destiny of the entire human race\". He also considered that \"the film's episodic structure and grand ambitions make it the greatest ancestor of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey\". Indeed, during early development of what would become 2001, co-writer Arthur C. Clarke had Kubrick watch Things to Come as an example of a grounded science fiction film; Kubrick, however, disliked it. After seeing 2001, Frederik Pohl complained in a 1968 Galaxy editorial that \"the science-fiction movie we've all been waiting for still hasn't come along. We think it's a disgrace that the most recent science-fiction movie made with a big budget, good actors and an actual sf writer preparing the script, not aimed at a juvenile market and uncontaminated by camp, is Things to Come... produced in 1936.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_1015", "question": "Who was the producer of Night in Paradise?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_64808", "text": "Mr. Paradise is curiously named; 'paradise' is evocative both of the Garden of Eden and Heaven; While Bevel is promised Heaven and Salvation by the evangelist and the river, the river baptism doesn't cure Mr. Paradise's cancer or make him 'count' to his mother or his family, and the river in fact sweeps Bevel away to his death; the River promises a Paradise, while a man who is actually named 'Paradise', who has observed the river baptism with skepticism and mockery throughout the story, and might be said to represent a rationalist skepticism, is also powerless to save Bevel. Does the man named Mr. Paradise represent some actual hope for paradise, as opposed to that offered by the Evangelist and Mrs. Connin? If so, clearly that hope is something beyond both the belief of the evangelist and Mrs. Connin, and the unbelief of Mr. Paradise, since neither are able to save Bevel. While Bevel's drowning in the river that promised him baptism and eternal life, that promised him that he would 'count' for something, is a grotesquely humorous irony, typical of O'Connor's stories, it might be pointed out that Bevel does indeed experience an epiphany of sorts as he is swept away to his death; 'for an instant he was overcome with surprise; then, since he was moving quickly and knew that he was getting somewhere, all his fury and his fear left him.' Baptism in Christian theology has long been associated with death and detachment; in baptism we enter into the death of Christ, undergoing a 'dying to sin' and a 'dying to self.' It is perhaps this dying to self that Bevel is experiencing as 'his fury and fear leave him' and why 'he knew he was getting somewhere.'", "hasanswer": false}]}

The producers had difficulty with the relationship between two main characters in the script as they felt that American audiences would interpret it as a homoerotic one. Producer Terence Chang, who worked with Woo on several productions, suggested to the American producers to have Hong Kong actress Michelle Yeoh play the role of the police officer to resolve any homoerotic reading of the film.  A year later, screenwriters Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. were hired by producers Charles Roven and Robert Cavallo to write a screenplay based on The Killer for Tristar, in which they wrote a third draft of the script was that was dated on 23 August 1993 which featured a story of a Caucasian hitman living in Hong Kong. This screenplay moved the focus from the pairing the hit man and the police detective characters to the characters of blinded night club singer and the hit man.

Clark originally decided he wanted to cast Fitzpatrick in a film after watching him skateboard in New York, and cursing when he could not land certain tricks.

Korine makes a cameo in the club scene with Jennie, as the kid wearing Coke-bottle glasses and a Nuclear Assault shirt who gives her drugs, though the part is credited to his brother Avi. Korine reportedly wrote the film's screenplay in 1993, at the age of 19, and principal photography took place during the summer of 1994. Contrary to the perception of many viewers, the film, according to Korine, was almost entirely scripted, with the only exception being the scene with Casper on the couch at the end, which was improvised. Gus Van Sant had been attached to the film as a producer. After insufficient interest had been generated in the film, he left the project.

It is the first feature film directed by Anton Corbijn, who had worked with Joy Division as a photographer. The screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh was based on the biography Touching from a Distance by Curtis's widow Deborah, who served as a co-producer on the film. Tony Wilson, who released Joy Division's records through his Factory Records label, also served as a co-producer. Curtis' bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via their post-Joy Division incarnation New Order. Control was filmed partly on location in Nottingham, Manchester, and Macclesfield, including areas where Curtis lived, and was shot in colour and then printed to black-and-white. Its title comes from the Joy Division song \"She's Lost Control\", and that much of the plot deals with the notion that Curtis tried to remain in control of his own life, and yet had no control over his epilepsy and pharmaceutical side effects. Sam Riley and Samantha Morton star as Ian and Deborah Curtis, and the film portrays the events of the couple's lives from 1973 to 1980, focusing on their marriage, the formation and career of Joy Division, Ian's struggle with epilepsy, and his extramarital affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honor\u00e9, culminating in his May 1980 suicide. Alexandra Maria Lara plays Honor\u00e9, while James Anthony Pearson, Joe Anderson, and Harry Treadaway play Sumner, Hook, and Morris, respectively. The film also features Toby Kebbell as band manager Rob Gretton and Craig Parkinson as Tony Wilson. Control premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2007 where it won several awards including the Director's Fortnight, the CICAE Art & Essai prize for best film, the Regards Jeunes Prize for best first/second directed feature film, and the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film in the sidebar. It went on to win five British Independent Film Awards including Best Film, Best Director for Corbijn, Most Promising Newcomer for Riley, and Best Supporting Actor for Kebbell.

After Hoffman showed the script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules, the two decided that The Desperate was the starting script they needed for Saw II and two months later, Bousman was flown to Toronto to direct. Whannell polished the script, with input from Wan, in order to bring it into the Saw universe, but kept the characters, traps and deaths from The Desperate script. Bousman said, \"But you could read the script for The Desperate and watch Saw II, and you would not be able to draw a comparison\". Bousman's first draft for The Desperate consisted in an X-rated violent film, but after Bousman's agent found difficult to have the script bought because most studios were turned off due to the level of violence, Bousman modified his script to be an R-rated film, which is when the executives of Lions Gate were turned on his potential. Overall, the framework of The Desperate had a similar bleak, disgusting atmosphere and a twist ending, which is why the Lions Gate executives found parallels in the script's style. Wan and Whannell also served as executive producers. All the previous film's crew members returned: editor Kevin Greutert, cinematographer Armstrong, and composer Charlie Clouser. This was to be Hoffman's last film. He died unexpectedly on December 4, 2005. Only those key cast and crew members who were involved in the film's ending were given the full script; the rest received only the first 88 pages. If a particular page was rewritten, the old page was shredded. Members were also required to sign confidentiality agreements requiring them not to release any plot details. Reportedly, \"four or five\" alternate endings were shot in order to keep the ending a surprise. Bousman gave the actors freedom to change dialogue in the script. He said that 95% of the time, the actors went by the script, with about 5% being adlibs, which he said \"made all of the difference in the world\". Donnie Wahlberg was allowed to modify some pieces of dialogue, especially those of Eric Matthews' interactions with his son Daniel and Jigsaw. For the former, Wahlberg added the line of what was the last thing Eric told Daniel basing it on what he says to his first son before hanging up the phone. For the latter, Wahlberg felt that the relationship between Eric and Jigsaw was \"too dicey\" and should emphasize Eric's need to sit with Jigsaw to rescue his son; Tobin Bell agreed with most of these changes, which Wahlberg added after finishing shooting every day, and the two improsived together on set. Hoffman said in an interview with Fangoria that they listened to fans' suggestions. For instance, instead of only showing the aftermath of a character violently dying in a flashback, they would allow it to unfold as it happened. This was in contrast to Saw, in which most of the violence was implied off-screen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After a show, the circus' resident gypsy fortune teller Esmerelda presents her beautiful niece, Talia, to her employers, asking them to give her a job. Bob and Horatio are both immediately smitten with the lovely woman, but her affections are solely for Bob. When the pair announce their plans to marry, Horatio becomes furious, and delivers an ultimatum to his brother to choose either Talia or himself. Bob marries Talia, and Esmerelda gives them a mysterious box as a wedding gift, which allows them to open a new circus. Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus, known for animals performing amazing, seemingly impossible, feats. Years later, Bob's son Owen marries his childhood friend Zoe at the circus, where they had first met as kids. Following the initial excitement however, Owen soon discovers he now has to work as a taste tester for Zoe's father Mr. Woodley at his dog biscuit factory. Fifteen years later, Horatio, whose luck has taken a serious downturn since his fight with Bob, sneaks into Bob and Talia's dressing rooms, trying to find the secret to the magic animals, and accidentally starts a fire which apparently kills Bob and Talia. Their funeral is attended by Owen, Zoe, and their daughter Mackenzie. Horatio makes an unexpected visit, and announces that he'll be taking over the circus. He and his friends start a fight, causing the Huntingtons to leave. Before they leave, circus pets, Old Blue the dog and Zena the cat, give the Huntingtons the mysterious box, they later discover it holds animal cracker cookies. Owen eats one and turns into a hamster. The Huntingtons return to the circus to figure out how this happened. They learn from clown Chesterfield that the animal crackers will turn the user into the animal they eat, but it contains only one human cookie to change them back. Later, he tells them they inherited the circus. Zoe is excited, but Owen, determined to please Mr. Woodley, decides to continue his job. Zoe restores the circus while Owen stays at the dog biscuit factory. Mr. Woodley, frustrated that Zoe quit her job, begins to consider Brock, an egotistical saboteur, as her replacement. Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus reopens, but is a disaster, upon the discovery of no animals. Owen reluctantly decides to eat the animal crackers and performs stunts as an animal. By the end of the day, Owen grows to like it, and decides to quit his job. As his finishes packing up though, Brock unwittingly eats one of the cookies and turns into a mandrill. To catch up with him, Owen turns into a lion, but Brock gets captured by Horatio's henchman Mario Zucchini, who also steals cookie pieces. Upon returning home, Owen soon discovers he has lost the human cookie, and will remain an animal forever. He attempts to adapt to life as a certain animal but has little success. Binkley, an employee of Mr. Woodley who's trying to create a new type of dog biscuit, discovers the animal crackers and persuades Mr. Woodley to attend the circus. At one performance, Horatio appears and offers Owen his human cookie in exchange for the circus. Owen however, refuses, thinking that remaining an animal will at least keep his family together, but he is forced into the deal by Horatio's henchmen, who are now mutated animals created from consuming the cookie pieces. The circus performers then come across the scene and a fight breaks out between them and his henchmen. Enraged, Horatio eats some crumbs and turns into a chimera. He is confronted by Old Blue and Zena who reveal themselves as Bob and Talia, alive but forever trapped in animal form due to the destruction of their human cookies in the fire. They ask Horatio to redeem himself, but he refuses. Horatio flies up, grasping them. Owen, Zoe, and Mackenzie, and the other circus performers work together to save Bob and Talia. Upon capturing Horatio, Owen turns him into a hamster as punishment. Bullet Man quotes In Memoriam A.H.H. from Alfred Lord Tennyson: \"I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it when I sorrow most; 'Tis better to have loved and lost. Than never to have loved at all.\" The henchmen are also caged and are gleefully told that since they ate the broken pieces of the animal crackers, their human cookies are in pieces and it will take quite a long time to figure out whose parts go to whom, much to their dismay. Having witnessed the entire fiasco, Mr. Woodley reevaluates his views on both Owen and the circus, and with Binkley, decides to create a new circus souvenir using her failed experiments; animal crackers that cause the eater's skin to temporarily take on the color and patterns of the animal whose cracker they eat. Owen and Zoe now work happily at the circus, with Owen debuting as a dragon.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hardy was very involved with the play, working closely with its producer, Alfred Evans, whose daughter Evelyn later recounted that the two had many discussions in the study at Max Gate \u2018deciding on the outline of the play, writing additional dialogue\u2019 and discussing whether particular scenes should be retained or left out. There were departures from the novel: while the novel ends of a tragic note, with John Loveday going off to his death on the battlefields of Spain, as Evelyn Evans writes: \u2018the curtain of the re-written play fell on laughter, song and dancing.\u2019 Hardy attended some rehearsals at the Corn Exchange, remarking on the fact that many of the performers were direct descendants of Dorset inhabitants who had lived through those turbulent times. Indeed, the production was thoroughly Dorchester-based: \u2018the scenery painted from designs by local artists; the uniforms made by a local tailor after originals that had been worn by the Dorset Rangers\u2019 and other local militia groups . Music was composed by a local musician, Frederick Boynton Smith. Unfortunately, Hardy, who was now 68 years old, couldn't attend the play as he was suffering from a chill, but Emma Hardy was there. He was, however, delighted by its reception. The production caused quite a stir. As the Dorset County Chronicle reported: \u2018there were to be observed in the front seats a posse of leading dramatic critics who had come down from London especially\u2019, writing \u2018critiques, to be wired to Town piping hot from their busily plying pencils.\u2019 The Times devoted nearly a column to its review of the play and a leading article two days later: extraordinary exposure for an amateur company in a small county town, but clear evidence of Hardy's status as an author of international standing. The reviews were so numerous that the company produced a souvenir programme containing extracts of them all. It runs to thousands of words: ten pages, double-columned and in very small print. As Captain Acland, curator of the Dorset County Museum wrote to Evans after watching the play: \u2018thanks, not only for the genuine treat it was to us all, but because you and your talented company have proved afresh to the world what Dorchester folk can do.\u2019 In 1910, the play was revived at the Weymouth Pavilion, and Hardy was able to attend, travelling there by train with Albert Evans and his family. He wrote personal congratulations afterwards to Mr Bawler and Mayor of Dorchester Mr Tilley on playing their roles so realistically. The play was again revived in 1912, for a performance at the Cripplegate Institute in London, which came with a very fine programme, including photos of the principal actors, engravings of Hardy's birthplace and \u2018Casterbridge from Ten Hatches\u2019 and the songs from the play, written by Hardy and with music by Harry Pouncy and Boyton Smith. In 1958 The Musicmakers presented a \"new musical in three acts\" titled Farewell my Fancy at the Everyman Theatre in Reading.  With book, music and lyrics by Michael Wild, the piece was a musical comedy \"suggested\" by The Trumpet Major and it featured all the major characters of the book. It was given six performances from 24 to 29 November 1958. A note of apology in the programme suggests that it was not authorised by the Hardy Estate.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The job is successful, but it turns out the drug lord wanted his nephew free to kill him. Rudy is waiting with a getaway plane, but he sees police cars and leaves Doc behind. After a year in a Mexican jail, Doc sends Carol to mob boss Jack Benyon, who is looking to put together a select team of experts to rob a dog track in Arizona. Benyon agrees to get Doc released from prison, in exchange for sexual favors from Carol first. Doc gets out and meets the men Benyon has hired. One is Rudy, along with Hansen, who seems inexperienced. Rudy extends a hand and says \"No hard feelings\" but is punched by Doc and warned not to double-cross him again. At the track, while Doc is breaking into the vault, a guard pulls a gun and is shot by Hansen in a panic. The thieves escape by creating a diversion with a bomb under a gas truck and leave with the cash, totaling over one million dollars. The plan was for Doc and Carol to meet Rudy and Hansen later to split the money. On the road, Rudy kills Hansen and pushes him out of the car. Doc arrives at the rendezvous point, where Rudy again pulls a gun. Doc expected this and is ready with his own weapon, shooting Rudy and leaving him for dead. Doc and Carol drive off with all the money, unaware that Rudy was wearing a bullet-proof vest. A wounded Rudy drives to a local clinic, where he holds veterinarian Harold and his wife Fran hostage, forces them to treat his wounds and drive him to El Paso. An attraction develops between Rudy and Fran and they taunt her meek husband. At a motel, Rudy has sex with Fran after tying Harold to a chair. Hearing his wife's moans and her laughter at him, a heart-broken Harold commits suicide by hanging himself. Fran barely looks back as she accompanies Rudy to El Paso.

Doc has to board the train, find the man and subdue him to retrieve the money.

Smith initially suggested that the album should be produced by Tom Dowd. Plans were made to book studio time with Dowd at Criteria in Miami, but these were complicated by his relationship with rival label Atlantic Records. Nonetheless, Smith had a change of heart and instead set out to enlist Welsh musician John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, to produce Horses, as she was impressed by the raw sound of his solo albums, such as 1974's Fear. Cale, who had previously seen Smith perform live and was acquainted with her bassist Ivan Kr\u00e1l, accepted. Horses was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, with Smith retaining the same backing band with whom she performed live\u2014Jay Dee Daugherty on drums, Lenny Kaye on guitar, Ivan Kr\u00e1l on bass guitar, and Richard Sohl on keyboards. Cale recalled that the band initially \"sounded awful\" and played out of tune due to their use of damaged instruments, forcing him to procure the band new instruments before work on the album began. The differences between the work ethics of Cale, who was an experienced recording artist, and of Smith, who at this point was primarily a live performer, became apparent early on in recording, and were a source of tension between the two artists, who frequently argued in the studio. The sole guest musicians on Horses were Allen Lanier of Blue \u00d6yster Cult and Tom Verlaine of Television. Cale had wished to augment the band's playing on certain songs with strings, but Smith vehemently opposed this idea. Lanier, who was Smith's boyfriend at the time, did not get along with Cale and particularly Verlaine. This tension culminated with Lanier and Verlaine getting into a physical altercation during the final recording session, held on September 18. By the end of recording, and for some years immediately following the album's release, Smith was quick to downplay Cale's contributions and suggested that she and her band had ignored his suggestions entirely. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Smith described the experience: Cale said in 1996 that Smith initially struck him as \"someone with an incredibly volatile mouth who could handle any situation\", and that as producer on Horses he wanted to capture the energy of her live performances, noting that there \"was a lot of power in Patti's use of language, in the way images collided with one another.\" He described their working relationship during recording as \"confrontational and a lot like an immutable force meeting an immovable object.\" Smith would later attribute much of the tension between herself and Cale to her inexperience with formal studio recording, recalling that she was \"very, very suspicious, very guarded and hard to work with\" and \"made it difficult for him to do some of the things he had to do.\" She expressed gratitude for Cale's persistence in working with her and her band and found that his production on Horses made the most out of their \"adolescent and honest flaws\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film as released now opens with this prologue, in titles rather than voice-over, written by Sturges when it was clear that no satisfactory revision to the original prologue was feasible:It does not seem to be generally understood that before ether there was nothing. The patient was strapped down...that is all. This is the story of W. T. G. Morton of Boston, Mass., before whom in all time surgery was agony, since whom science has control of pain. Of all things in nature great men alone reverse the laws of perspective and grow smaller as one approaches them. Dwarfed by the magnitude of his revelation, reviled, hated by his fellow men, forgotten before he was remembered, Morton seems very small indeed until the incandescent moment he ruined himself for a servant girl and gained immortality. The film was heavily re-cut, to the point that some of the narrative became almost incomprehensible. Eliminated from the re-cut version was a brief sequence which preceded even the framing story with Frost and widow Lizzie. This initial sequence shifted back and forth between a scene of child in a contemporary hospital being wheeled into the operating room and being assured by his parents that the operation will not hurt and a scene of a broken and impoverished Morton in the previous century pawning his medals. The first flashback sequence was cut particularly heavily by the studio, since it was not only chronologically subsequent to the second flashback, but also was almost totally devoid of humor. The most significant segment eliminated from the first flashback was Morton's confession to Lizzie on the evening after his sacrifice, which would have appeared very early in the sequence. It reads in part : Morton: \"[T]oday at the hospital ... the Medical Society wouldn't let them use the Letheon ... unless they knew what it was so ... they asked me what it was.\" Mrs Morton: \"But you didn't just tell them ...\" \"... I mean you weren't such a fool as to tell them the most valuable secret in the world, JUST FOR THE ASKING?\" Morton: \"But Lizzie they were going to take her leg off without it ... without anything!\" \"They were just going to strap her down and hack it off!\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Herlihy and Sandler were roommates in college and wrote stand-up comedy together, before moving on to screenplays. After Sandler was fired from SNL in 1995, he moved on to films. He and Herlihy wrote Billy Madison , which proved successful for distributor Universal Pictures. As such, Herlihy and Sandler began a new project. In an office during a brainstorming session, they came up with a high-concept premise for a film about a \"hockey player who smacks a 400 yard drive\". Judd Apatow performed a script rewrite, although he went uncredited. The Happy Gilmore character is loosely based on Sandler's childhood friend Kyle McDonough, who played ice hockey and would golf with Sandler as they grew up. Sandler could never hit the ball as far as McDonough, and figured that McDonough's hockey skills gave him an edge. Meanwhile, Chubbs Peterson's missing hand is an in-joke referencing actor Carl Weathers' film Predator , which depicts his character losing his arm. Herlihy and Sandler included any joke that made them laugh and do not remember who came up with which, although Herlihy takes credit for Shooter McGavin's \"I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast\" line. In a 1994 interview, Sandler cited the golf comedy Caddyshack , a film he and Herlihy bonded over in college, as inspiration. Former pro golfer Mark Lye served as a consultant on the script, and told Herlihy and Sandler after seeing their initial ideas, \"You gotta be crazy. You cannot do a movie like that.\" According to Lye, the initial drafts featured Happy winning the Masters Tournament: \"They had the green jacket. They were desecrating the USGA. Making fun of Augusta National.\" He suggested that Happy win a fictional tournament, and Herlihy and Sandler changed the jacket's color from green to gold. Lye also disliked the unrealistic nature of early drafts, which depicted Happy repeatedly making 400-yard drives, so he took the crew to a PGA Tour event so they could understand the atmosphere of golf. The final script, the one Lye gave approval, was Herlihy and Sandler's fifth draft. Dugan became attached to direct through Sandler. Years earlier, Dugan had attempted to cast Sandler in one of his films, but the producers did not let him because Sandler was not well-known. \"A couple of years later, [Sandler] is big\", Dugan said. \"I wanted to be hired to direct Happy Gilmore with him. I walk in the room, and he says: 'You're the guy who wanted to give me that part. I don't need to know anything else, I want to work with you.'\" Happy Gilmore was produced on a budget of $12\u00a0million and filmed entirely at locations in British Columbia. Most scenes taking place at golf courses were filmed at Pitt Meadows at the Swan-e-set Bay Resort & Country Club, while interior shots, such as those in the broadcast booth, took place in an abandoned Vancouver hospital. Arthur Albert served as cinematographer, while Mark Lane was the set decorator. Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh composed the film's soundtrack.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hoberman said ABC wanted Michael Richards, who had previously starred as a private investigator in his eponymous NBC comedy series two years earlier, for the show, but Richards turned it down. Hoberman brought in Andy Breckman as creator, and Breckman, inspired by Sherlock Holmes, introduced Dr. Kroger as a Doctor Watson-like character and an Inspector Lestrade-like character who eventually became Captain Stottlemeyer. Although ABC originated the show, the network handed it off to the USA Network. USA is now owned by NBC . Monk was the first ABC Studios-produced show aired on USA Network instead of ABC. Although ABC initially refused Monk, they did air repeats of the show on ABC between June\u2013November 2002, and then again between March\u2013May 2004. On January 12, 2006, USA Network announced that Monk had been picked up through at least season six as one of the \"highest-rated series in cable history.\" An in-joke reference to this contract renewal was also inserted into the episode \"Mr. Monk and the Big Reward\", which aired around this time. Season five premiered Friday, July 7, 2006, at 9:00\u00a0pm Eastern time. This marked the first time change for the program, which aired at 10:00\u00a0pm during its first four seasons. The change allowed the show to work as a lead-in to a new USA Network series, Psych, another offbeat detective program. Monk followed a consistent format of airing half of its 16 episodes in midyear and the second half early the following year, with the exception of the first season, which broadcast entirely from July through October 2002, and the final season, which broadcast entirely between August and December 2009. Previously aired episodes of Monk began airing on NBC Universal sibling network NBC April 6, 2008. NBC eyed the show because its block with Psych could be plugged into NBC's schedule intact. The shows were being used to increase the scripted programming on the network as production of its own scripted programming ramped back up following the writers' strike.

Conflict, pain, and suffering have been mostly removed from human experience. Emotion, love, freedom, individuality, and joy have also been removed. Babies are brought into being through genetic engineering, and sexual desire is chemically suppressed. All memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory, to shield the rest of the community from pain. The Receiver of Memory and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 are the only people able to see in color, which is otherwise eliminated from the community to prevent envy. The community is ruled by elders, including the Chief Elder. Jonas is an 18-year-old boy whose best friends are Asher and Fiona. On graduation day, Jonas is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories of history from his predecessor, the Giver. During his training with the Giver, Jonas gradually learns about the past and about joy, pain, death, and love. He stops taking his daily injections and begins to experience emotion. Those who leave the community are said to have been \"released to Elsewhere\", but Jonas learns that to be a euphemism for euthanasia by lethal injection. Jonas also learns that the Giver's daughter, Rosemary, had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. When she began her training, however, Rosemary became so distraught from the memories that she received that she asked to be \"released\". Jonas learned the memories received from the Giver and accidentally shares his memories with a baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father. He develops a close relationship with Gabriel upon discovering that they share a birthmark, the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory, and both can see in color. Appalled by the deception of his community and the Elders' disregard for human life, Jonas comes to believe that everyone should have memories of the past. Eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is for Jonas to travel past the border of their land to \"Elsewhere\". Doing so would release memories and color back into the community. When Jonas tries to leave his neighborhood, he encounters Asher, who tries to stop Jonas but is punched by Jonas. Jonas retrieves Gabriel, who is to be \"released\" for having failed to meet developmental marker, at the Nurturing Center. Meanwhile, Jonas' mother and Asher go to the Chief Elder to say that Jonas is missing. Jonas steals a motorcycle and drives away with Gabriel. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and \"lose\" him. When Asher finds Jonas and Gabriel in the desert, Jonas implores Asher to trust him and to let them go.

Unmoved by the Giver's arguments, the Chief Elder asserts that freedom is a bad idea because when they are left to their own devices, people make bad choices. Jonas and Gabriel enter a snowy area. Jonas falls to the ground and is overcome by the cold weather. However, he sees a sled like the one that he rode in a memory that he had received from the Giver.

Granada was initially sceptical of producing it; the company's executive chairman and chief executive\u2014Charles Allen and Simon Shaps respectively\u2014believed that Blair would be forced to resign as Prime Minister over the impending war in Iraq, consequently leaving the story outdated. The project was believed to be \"too cerebral\" and attempts were made to persuade Morgan to develop a television series to replace Cold Feet, another Granada production. John Whiston and Andy Harries convinced Allen and Shaps otherwise, citing Granada's history of producing ground-breaking drama and film as reasons for why The Deal should be made. ITV's director of channels, David Liddiment, who supported the production, resigned in December 2002 and was replaced by Nigel Pickard, who shared the concerns of Allen and Shaps. Peter Morgan wrote his first script draft in the three weeks preceding Christmas 2002. Recent events such as the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak and the contention surrounding the September Dossier made him believe that the perceived adversity between Brown and Blair was no longer in the public consciousness. His opinion was changed when he watched the 2002 Labour Party Conference and saw a \"thunderous expression\" on Brown's face as Bill Clinton praised Blair in his speech; Morgan realised that the rivalry was not over. This draft was extremely sympathetic to Brown, focusing on what Morgan called \"Gordon's heartbreak\". Subsequent rewrites toned down this approach, though Brown still remained the \"main character\". The relationship between Brown and Blair as depicted in the script was based on that between Aaron Altman and Tom Grunick, the characters portrayed by Albert Brooks and William Hurt in Broadcast News. Morgan wanted to set the entire film in the 12 days following the death of John Smith, but the time frame was widened because the Labour Party's disastrous result at the 1992 general election was \"absolutely crucial\" to the relationship and motives of the main characters; Morgan had to show the moment Blair decided to aim to become leader of the party. Morgan and the producers engaged in a lengthy research process during script writing and editing, interviewing 40 to 50 of Brown and Blair's closest friends and advisors, as well as aides involved in the 1992 and 1997 elections. Significantly, many of the facts in the film are based on the first three chapters of James Naughtie's book The Rivals: The Intimate Portrait of a Political Marriage. The film briefly adopted The Rivals as a working title, but soon reverted to The Deal. Another title considered by Frears was Bambi and Stalin, based on a line in a speech given by Blair in 1995. Scenes set in the House of Commons chamber and committee rooms use the actual words as recorded in Hansard. In other scenes Morgan utilised dramatic licence, conceding that there was no evidence to suggest that any of the lines spoken elsewhere in the film were ever said in real life. The relationship between Brown and Blair received many thematic analogies; Morgan likened Brown's story to a \"tragedy of an over-qualified Scot, who the Labour Party probably rightly felt at the time that it could not have as its leader.\"; Despite the quote at the head of the film referring to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Frears wryly likened Brown and Blair to Beavis and Butt-head.

The project went into turnaround\u2014a process allowing other studios to purchase the idea. The script was rejected approximately 40 times, sometimes multiple times by the same studios. Reasons given included the concept being unappealing to contemporary rebellious youth, and the failures of other time travel films like The Final Countdown and Time Bandits . Walt Disney Productions turned it down because they considered Marty having to fight off his future mother's advances too risqu\u00e9 for their brand. The only person supportive of the project was Spielberg. However, with their previous collaborations considered relative failures, Gale and Zemeckis feared another misstep would give them a reputation of only getting work because they were friends with Spielberg. Zemeckis opted to accept the next project offered to him, Romancing the Stone . Against pre-release expectations, the film was a significant success, and gave Zemeckis enough credibility to return to Back to the Future. Zemeckis held a grudge against the studios that had failed to support the project and turned to Spielberg, who had set up his own production company, Amblin Entertainment, at Universal Studios, where Price now worked. Spielberg disliked Price because he rejected E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and demanded his involvement in Back to the Future be minimal. Sidney Sheinberg installed himself as chief executive to oversee the studio's investment in the project. Amblin executives Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joined Spielberg as the film's executive producers. However, rights to Back to the Future remained tied to Columbia Pictures. Guy McElwaine\u2014Price's successor at Columbia Pictures\u2014was developing a satire of the Universal-owned noir film Double Indemnity called Big Trouble . Its similarities to Double Indemnity meant the studio would violate Universal Pictures' copyright. With production imminent, McElwaine asked for the rights from Price; in exchange, Price obtained the rights to Back to the Future. Sheinberg suggested modifications to the film including changing the title to Space Man from Pluto because he believed Back to the Future would not resonate with audiences. Gale and Zemeckis did not know how to reject Sheinberg's suggestions without risking his ire. Spielberg intervened, sending Sheinberg a memo reading: \"Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep 'em coming.\" Spielberg knew Sheinberg would be too embarrassed to admit his memo was to be taken seriously. Sheinberg later claimed the story was \"bullshit\". He also wanted to change the name of Marty's mother from Meg to Lorraine , and rename Professor Brown to Doc Brown because he considered it more accessible. A third draft was completed by July 1984. The lengthy development allowed Gale and Zemeckis to refine the script's jokes, especially ones that had become dated since 1980. The joke about former actor Ronald Reagan becoming President of the United States remained following his re-election in 1984.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He then considered making the film in Telugu with Rajasekhar in a leading role, alongside either Nagarjuna or Venkatesh, but the plans did not materialise. In June 1995, producer A. M. Rathnam signed on Shankar to make the venture featuring leading actor Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The film, retitled as Indian, was initially reported to be loosely based on the life of prominent Indian freedom fighter, Subhas Chandra Bose. Shankar tried to cast Aishwarya Rai to make her debut and portray the leading female role. Still, her commitment to her advertisement agency until October 1995 meant that she was unavailable to sign the film. Subsequently, Manisha Koirala, who appeared in the critically acclaimed 1995 Mani Ratnam film Bombay was selected as the lead heroine. The producers signed on Raadhika to play the pair of the older Kamal Haasan in the film, but her television commitments meant that she was unable to sign a contract. Urvashi's sister subsequently replaced her, only for Shankar to throw her out for missing a day's schedule to attend her wedding. The role was finally handed to Sukanya, who had previously appeared alongside Kamal Haasan in Mahanadhi. Bollywood actress Urmila Matondkar was signed to play a role in the film after the producers were impressed with her performance and the success of her 1995 Hindi film, Rangeela. Nassar was chosen to portray an important character in the film; however, as he was busy with other films, he could not accept the offer instead, he provided a voice for Nedumudi Venu. Then Shankar hired Malayalam famous character artist Nedumudi Venu to play the role. The producers engaged Hollywood make-up artistes Michael Westmore and Michael Jones to work on the designs for the senior Kamal Haasan's and Sukanya's look in the film. For production work, Shankar visited Las Vegas to learn about new technology and purchased cameras for the production. Furthermore, the director visited Australia alongside cinematographer Jeeva and music director A. R. Rahman to location hunt and to compose tunes. The film's unit were given strict orders to maintain privacy, with Hindi actor Jackie Shroff being notably turned away from visiting the shooting spot. A song for the film was shot at Prasad Studios featuring Kamal Haasan and Urmila Matondkar alongside 70 Bombay models. This led to a protest from the Cine Dancers Union who argued that Tamil dancers should have been utilised instead, with Shankar opting to pay them off to avoid further hassle. Another duet between Kamal Haasan and Manisha Koirala was shot near the Sydney Opera House in Sydney and Canberra for fifteen days. A flashback song was canned with four hundred dancers and a thousand extras at Gingee with Kamal Haasan and Sukanya, while another song featured shooting in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Graphic designer Venky noted that Indian was his most difficult project to date with a scene constructed to feature Kamal Haasan's character alongside freedom fighter, Subhas Chandra Bose. Venky had to remove blemishes on the film reel of Bose provided by the Film Division's archive before merging Kamal Haasan on to the shot to make it appear that the pair were marching in tandem. It was the most expensive Indian film at the time. According to an estimate by film critic G. Dhananjayan, the production budget was approximately . Rediff.com estimates the film's budget to be  .

The original plan was for the film to be live footage from the album's tour, together with Scarfe's animation and extra scenes, and for Waters himself to star. EMI did not intend to make the film, as they did not understand the concept. Director Alan Parker, a Pink Floyd fan, asked EMI whether The Wall could be adapted to film. EMI suggested that Parker talk to Waters, who had asked Parker to direct the film. Parker instead suggested that he produce it and give the directing task to Gerald Scarfe and Michael Seresin, a cinematographer. Waters began work on the film's screenplay after studying scriptwriting books. He and Scarfe produced a special-edition book containing the screenplay and art to pitch the project to investors. While the book depicted Waters in the role of Pink, after screen tests, he was removed from the starring role and replaced with new wave musician and frontman of the Boomtown Rats, Bob Geldof. In Behind the Wall, both Waters and Geldof later admitted to a story during casting where Geldof and his manager took a taxi to an airport, and Geldof's manager pitched the role to the singer, who continued to reject the offer and express his contempt for the project throughout the fare, unaware that the taxi driver was Waters' brother, who told Waters about Geldof's opinion. Since Waters was no longer in the starring role, it no longer made sense for the feature to include Pink Floyd footage, so the live film aspect was dropped. The footage culled from the five Wall concerts at Earl's Court from 13\u201317 June 1981 that were held specifically for filming was deemed unusable also for technical reasons as the fast Panavision lenses needed for the low light levels turned out to have insufficient resolution for the movie screen. Complex parts such as \"Hey You\" still had not been properly shot by the end of the live shows. Parker convinced Waters and Scarfe that the concert footage was too theatrical and that it would jar with the animation and stage live action. After the concert footage was dropped, Seresin left the project and Parker became sole director.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Joanne B. Freeman, a history professor at Yale, contrasted the show's Hamilton to the \"real Hamilton [who] was a mass of contradictions: an immigrant who sometimes distrusted immigrants, a revolutionary who placed a supreme value on law and order, a man who distrusted the rumblings of the masses yet preached his politics to them more frequently and passionately than many of his more democracy-friendly fellows\". Australian historian Shane White found the framing of the show's story \"troubling\", stating that he and many historian colleagues \"would like to imagine that Hamilton is a last convulsion of the founding father mythology\". According to White, Miranda's depiction of the founding of the United States \"infuses new life into an older view of American history\" that centered on the Founding Fathers, instead of joining the many historians who were \"attempting to get away from the Great Men story\" by incorporating \"ordinary people, African-Americans, Native Americans and women\" into a \"more inclusive and nuanced\" historical narrative in which Hamilton has a \"cameo rather than leading role\". Rutgers University professor Lyra Monteiro criticized the show's multi-ethnic casting as obscuring a complete lack of identifiable enslaved or free persons of color as characters in the show. Monteiro identified other commentators, such as Ishmael Reed, who criticized the show for making Hamilton and other historical personages appear more progressive on racial injustice than they really were. In The Baffler, policy analyst Matt Stoller criticized the musical's portrayal of Hamilton as an idealist committed to democratic principles, in contrast to what he characterized as the historical record of Hamilton's reactionary, anti-democratic politics and legacy. For example, Stoller cited Hamilton as a leader involved in the Newburgh conspiracy ; his development of a national financial system which, in Stoller's view, empowered the plutocratic elite; and his use of military force, indefinite detention, and mass arrests against dissenters during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791. In 2007, history writer William Hogeland criticized Chernow's biography of Hamilton on similar grounds in the Boston Review. In 2018, Historians on Hamilton: How a Blockbuster Musical Is Restaging America's Past was published. Fifteen historians of early America authored essays on ways the musical both engages with and sometimes misinterprets history.

These deferred personnel also split 45 profit points. But we couldn't find a grip or gaffer to do it for free, so we paid those guys $50 a day.\u201d Most of the costumes used in the film were the actors' own clothes, with the exception Sean Gullette's which came from thrift stores. There was a standard kit fee for make-up and hairstyling that amounted to about $25 per day. The producers managed to get a free lighting package, and all of the money within the electric department was then shifted toward the gaffer and expendables. The Bolex H16 Camera was borrowed, but the crew ended up breaking it, and money had to be budgeted to fix it; an Aanton 16mm camera package was also used. Vehicles used in the film included a cab and a station wagon. In order to obtain the cab, Aronofsky stated that they hailed a cab and paid the driver $100 to keep his car there. The station wagon belonged to the film's consulting producer, who rented it to them. The film was sent to be developed in Bono Labs in Arlington, Virginia, which, according to Aronofsky, was the only one that could develop black and white reversal stock. Consequently, the crew only received dailies after a week of sending the footage in. Raw stock cost $5,414, and developing it cost $18,000. While the crew was able to shoot in the warehouse for free, they did have to pay the electricity bill, which increased dramatically during filming. During post-production, most of the budget went toward the negative cut, which was a matchback from an AVID cut-list. The score was created by Clint Mansell on his own equipment, for which he was paid a deferred fee. The rest of the money for music went toward rights for festival entries.

The album followed the same pattern as Carey's previous two albums, Daydream and Butterfly , in which she began her transition into the urban adult contemporary market. Rainbow contains a mix of hip hop-influenced R&B tracks, as well as a variety of slow ballads. Carey produced the album with David Foster and Diane Warren, who, as well as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, replaced Walter Afanasieff, the main balladeer Carey worked with throughout the 1990s. As a result of her separation from her husband, Tommy Mottola, Carey had more control over the musical style of this album, so she collaborated with several urban artists and rappers such as Jay-Z, Usher and Snoop Dogg, as well as Missy Elliott, Joe, Da Brat, Master P, 98 Degrees and Mystikal. On Carey's previous album, Butterfly, she began incorporating several other genres, including R&B and hip hop, into her musical repertoire. In order to further push her musical horizons, Carey featured Jay-Z on the album's lead single, the first time in her career that another artist was featured on one of her lead singles. Carey wrote ballads that were closer to R&B than pop for this album, and worked with Snoop Dogg and Usher on songs such as \"Crybaby\" and \"How Much\", respectively, both of which featured strong R&B beats and grooves. Several of the ballads that Carey wrote during this period, including \"Thank God I Found You\" and \"After Tonight\" , mirrored sentiments she experienced in her personal life. The album spawned five singles, two of which became number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, making Rainbow her seventh-consecutive studio album to produce one or more number-one hits. The album's lead single, \"Heartbreaker\", became Carey's fourteenth number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the record charts in Canada and New Zealand. \"Thank God I Found You\", featuring Joe and 98 Degrees, also topped the Billboard Hot 100, but achieved moderate international chart success. The next two singles, \"Can't Take That Away and \"Crybaby\" featuring Snoop Dogg, were released as a double A-side. The songs were at the center of a public feud in between Carey and Sony Music due to the label's alleged weak promotion of the singles. Carey's cover of Phil Collins' \"Against All Odds \" with Westlife peaked at number one in Ireland, Scotland and the UK Singles Chart. Rainbow was well received by music critics, who generally praised Carey's embrace of R&B and hip hop in her music. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 323,000. It was her first album in years to not reach number one. However, within a month, Rainbow was certified triple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , denoting shipments of three million copies within the United States.

He wrote eight scripts in eight years, including The Bodyguard which Kasdan says was inspired by Yojimbo with Steve McQueen as the lead. \"I was interested in what kind of a guy would do that kind of work: to be willing to lay down his life for a salary, for someone he may care nothing about-maybe even have negative feelings about,\" said Kasdan. Kasdan says it was the first really good script he wrote: I loved all my early scripts and I expected everybody else to love them. It wasn't until I wrote 'The Bodyguard' and sensed it was different that I realized I was writing an increased level of density. A good script has levels of action going on, unexpected turns. Movies are an economical form. Your script must communicate in the tersest possible way an emotional feeling, imply it in a mosaic of tiny scenes. An unknown screenwriter selling a speculative script must deliver a delight. An established writer gets a lot of rope. The producer reads his script and says, 'I don't feel any delight but he must know what he's doing.' A lot of times he doesn't, and you have a lousy movie. Kasdan wrote it in 1975 and the script succeeded in getting him an agent, but it took the agent two years to sell the script\u2014he says 67 people passed on it. Eventually the script was sold to John Calley for $20,000. Calley brought in John Boorman to direct. Kasdan admired Boorman and went to Ireland with the director where they did a treatment for a new movie. \"He completely changed it, but I still loved him,\" said Kasdan. In November 1978, the film was going ahead with Ryan O'Neal and Diana Ross. Then, Ross pulled out of the movie which went back into development hell. After Kasdan made his successful directorial debut with Body Heat he was asked to direct The Bodyguard but he was reluctant, preferring to make The Big Chill. Kevin Costner read the script when making Silverado with Kasdan and became enthusiastic about it. The two men decided to produce it together.

That year, Frequency won Scion's New York leg of the King of the Beats competition, and produced a number of records for major label artists such as \u201cPlenty of Love\u201d by Raekwon, Gravy and Tikky Diamonds and \u201cYa\u2019ll Can\u2019t Live His Life\u201d by Cam'ron and \"Think About It\" by Snoop Dogg.  Snoop himself repeatedly referred to the song in interviews as his favorite track on the album. Soon thereafter, Frequency began working with the Trackmasters, with whom he produced several tracks for an unreleased Lil' Kim LP, as well as tracks for The Game, Keyshia Cole, Beenie Man, Slim and others.  He also continued to place records on his own, producing songs such as \u201cOne Chance \u201d for Snoop Dogg's 2008 release Ego Trippin', \"Like Me\" for Ja Rule, and \"White Linen Affair\" for Ghostface Killah. By 2009, Frequency began working extensively with Slaughterhouse, serving as their tour DJ, producing their first two singles -- \"Onslaught\" and \"Fight Klub\"\u2014and working with each individual member.  In December of that year, Frequency released \"Road Kill\" with Joell Ortiz, a mixtape featuring freestyles that Joell recorded during the K.O.D. Tour and four original tracks, three of which - \"Ortiz In This Bitch\", \"Snake Charmer\", and \"50 For the People\" \u2014 were produced by Frequency. Over the next several years, Frequency went on to work with Machine Gun Kelly, B.o.B., Iffy the Badman and more. Frequency is perhaps best known for co-writing and co-producing the #1 hit song \"The Monster\" by Eminem featuring Rihanna, released in October 2013.  \"The Monster\" reached No. 1 on eight separate Billboard charts, including four weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 and thirteen weeks at No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.  It also topped the charts in twelve countries including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and won a Grammy for Best/Rap Sung Collaboration. In recent years, Frequency has expanded his horizons by working on more pop and rock projects.  Specifically, Frequency produced the debut album for New York-based band MisterWives, entitled Our Own House.  The album's lead single \"Reflections\" peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart and went Gold.  Frequency also produced the debut album \"Waiting For The Sun\" from Weekday/Sony band Jule Vera and 5 of 7 songs on the debut EP from Bryce Fox.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is a sequel to the 1982 film Tron, whose director Steven Lisberger returned to produce. The cast includes Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprising their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley, respectively, as well as Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, James Frain, Beau Garrett and Michael Sheen. The story follows Flynn's adult son Sam, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality called \"the Grid,\" where Sam, his father, and the algorithm Quorra must stop the malevolent program Clu from invading the real world. Interest in creating a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, in and around the city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music. Tron: Legacy premiered in Tokyo on November 30, 2010 and was theatrically released in North America on December 17, 2010. Disney vigorously promoted the film across multiple media platforms, including merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews from film critics, who praised the visual effects, production design and soundtrack, but criticized the character development, cast performance and story. The film grossed $400\u00a0million during its worldwide theatrical run, making it a box office success. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Inception. Like its predecessor, Tron: Legacy has also been described as a cult film. In 2020, it was announced that a sequel was in development.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He co-wrote the screenplay with Brit Marling, who also stars in the film. Batmanglij and Marling also wrote the screenplay for Sound of My Voice and went to Los Angeles in 2009 to produce a film. Due to the economy, they could not make the film that year. They were then inspired by the concept of Buy Nothing Day, an international day of protest against consumerism, and decided to experience a Buy Nothing summer. They spent two months in 2009 with proponents of freeganism, which is a practice of eating \"discarded food in their pursuit of a moneyless existence\". Marling said, \"We wanted to have some adventure, and we didn't have any money. We learned to hop trains, we learned to sleep on rooftops, we learned to claim the space that feels so private. We joined this anarchist collective.\" The pair drew from their experiences as well as thriller films like All The President's Men, The Bourne Identity and Michael Clayton to craft The East, which they wrote before they began filming Sound of My Voice for a 2011 release. Batmanglij and Marling wrote to have the anarchist organization target a multinational corporation instead of a government. Marling said, \"Multinational corporations are outside of the purview of any nation-state. These are the entities that are shaping and running the world... The modern anarchy movement is about rebelling against the corporate structure.\" Batmanglij said the film focused on the pharmaceutical industry due to the writers hearing stories about the side effects of drugs, such as a drug to help quit smoking that resulted in some people committing suicide. He said they considered focusing on banks due to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, but they chose the pharmaceutical industry so the mission in the film would have emotional resonance. They titled the film The East to make a variety of references. The director explained, \"'The East' is ... the East Coast, which is like something in our American collective consciousness\u2014New England, tony, center of power. The Wicked Witch of the East in the Oz mythology was the bad witch because the book was about how the Midwest was getting screwed over by the east, by Washington. And then of course we have the Middle East or the Far East, which is seen as different or other. The ultimate Other. So, it's funny that this word means two things, and I thought that was an interesting name for a resistance group that is combined of kids from New England who want to make themselves the Other.\" Sound of My Voice, directed by Batmanglij and starring Marling, screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in January. Producer Michael Costigan, who liked Sound of My Voice, got a copy of the screenplay for The East. Costigan liked the screenplay and approached Batmanglij to say that he and his fellow producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott at Scott Free Productions were interested in making the film. After the festival, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired distribution rights for Sound of My Voice and Another Earth . In the process, the distributor greenlighted production of The East. By September 2011, Marling and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd were cast in the starring roles. Felicity Jones was attached to play Izzy, but she dropped out to promote Like Crazy. Jones was replaced by Elliot Page. Production of the film, which had a budget of , took place in Shreveport, Louisiana.

During the story development process, several elements of the original novel were dropped or changed. The game was developed by Wolf Team, an independent game development studio founded in 1986. Due to bad experiences at Telenet Japan, the previous employer of multiple Wolf Team members, the staff sought an independent publisher for the game. After an unsuccessful pitch to Enix, they entered a publishing contract with Bandai Namco . Phantasia had a troubled development cycle for the original Super Famicom version, with many creative disagreements between Wolf Team and Namco. The disagreements led to most of the Wolf Team staff leaving after the game in order to start a new company, tri-Ace, which would go on to make the Star Ocean series. Remaining members would continue to develop games in the Tales series. The studio remained independent until 2003, when it was acquired by Bandai Namco and renamed Namco Tales Studio.

{"id": "164_1091", "question": "Who was the producer of Lincoln?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_59", "text": "On May 9\u201310, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement. Exploiting his embellished frontier legend , Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\". In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign. At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy. On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\". As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South. Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln. As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000\u2013200,000 copies. Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War. Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. His victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Tinners Way, born in 1990 to Secretariat's last crop, winner of the 1994 and 1995 Pacific Classic. Ultimately, Secretariat officially sired 663 named foals, including 341 winners and 54 stakes winners . There has been some criticism of Secretariat as a stallion, mainly because he did not produce male offspring of his own ability and did not leave a leading sire son behind, but his legacy is assured through the quality of his daughters, several of whom were excellent racers and even more of whom were excellent producers. In 1992, Secretariat was the leading broodmare sire in North America. Overall, Secretariat's daughters produced 24 Grade/Group 1 winners. As a broodmare sire, Secretariat's most notable progeny were: Weekend Surprise, a stakes winner and the 1992 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Her sons include 1990 Preakness winner Summer Squall and 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy. Terlingua, a stakes winner and dam of leading sire Storm Cat. Secrettame, a stakes winner and dam of important sire Gone West, whose descendants include Kentucky Derby winner Smarty Jones. Six Crowns, dam of champion two-year-old and sire Chief's Crown. Sister Dot, dam of champion two-year-old and sire Dehere. Celtic Assembly, dam of Volksraad, leading sire in New Zealand. Betty's Secret, dam of Secreto, winner of The Derby, and Istabraq, three-time winner of the Champion Hurdle. Through Weekend Surprise and Terlingua alone, Secretariat appears in the pedigree of numerous champions. Weekend Surprises's son A.P. Indy was the leading sire in North America in 2003 and 2006, and is the sire of 2003 Horse of the Year Mineshaft and 2007 Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches. He has also established a successful sire-line that leads to Kentucky Derby winners Orb and California Chrome. A.P. Indy's leading sire-line descendant is Tapit, who led the sire list in 2014\u20132015 and is the sire of Belmont Stakes winners Tonalist and Creator. Terlingua's son Storm Cat is also a two time leading sire, whose offspring include Giant's Causeway, three-time leading sire in North America. Storm Cat also sired Yankee Gentleman, who is the broodmare sire of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. Both Storm Cat and A.P. Indy appear in the pedigree of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify. Inbreeding to Secretariat has also proven successful, as exemplified by numerous graded stakes winners, including two-time Horse of the Year Wise Dan, as well as sprint champion Speightstown. Secretariat's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions: Drone, Sir Ivor, and Hall of Fame inductee Spectacular Bid.

Difford claims that in 1973, he stole 50p from his mother's purse to put a card in a local sweetshop window to advertise for a guitarist to join his band, although he was not actually in a band at the time. Tilbrook was the only person who responded to the advertisement. Difford and Tilbrook began writing songs together, and soon added Jools Holland and Paul Gunn to form an actual band. The group performed under several names, most frequently \"Captain Trundlow's Sky Company\" or \"Skyco\", before selecting the band name \"Squeeze\" as a facetious tribute to the Velvet Underground's oft-derided 1973 album Squeeze. Gilson Lavis replaced Gunn on drums, and Harry Kakoulli joined on bass in 1975. Squeeze's early career was spent around Deptford in south-east London, where they were part of a lively local music scene which included Alternative TV and Dire Straits. Though the group was initially signed to Miles Copeland III's BTM Records, the label went under in late 1976, and so their early singles and debut EP, 1977's Packet of Three, were released on the Deptford Fun City label. Squeeze's first EP and most of their self-titled debut album were produced by John Cale for A&M Records. Cale had been a member of Velvet Underground from whose album Squeeze took their name. However, the debut album's two hit singles were produced by the band themselves, as the label found Cale's recordings uncommercial. In the United States and Canada, the band and album were dubbed UK Squeeze owing to legal conflicts arising from a contemporary American band called \"Tight Squeeze\". The \"U.K.\" was dropped for all subsequent releases. In Australia, the same name change was used due to legal conflicts arising from an existing Sydney-based band also called \"Squeeze\". Albums in Australia were credited to UK Squeeze up to and including 1985's Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti. The band's second album, Cool for Cats , contained the band's two highest charting UK singles in \"Cool For Cats\" and \"Up The Junction\", both of which peaked at No.\u00a02. John Bentley replaced Harry Kakoulli on bass in 1979 following the release of the LP. Argybargy , the band's third album, was also a UK hit. It was additionally a mild breakthrough in North America, as the single \"Another Nail in My Heart\" was a No.\u00a056 hit in Canada, and second single \"Pulling Mussels \" received airplay on US rock radio stations. The video for the former was frequently shown on independent video music shows in the US. Keyboardist Jools Holland left the band for a solo career in 1980. He was replaced by highly rated singer-keyboardist Paul Carrack, a former member of both British soul-pop band Ace and progressive rock band Roxy Music. In 1981, the band released East Side Story. It was produced by Elvis Costello and Roger Bechirian, and featured Carrack's lead vocals on the radio hit \"Tempted\". Carrack himself left after the release of East Side Story, and was replaced by Don Snow. This line-up recorded the Sweets from a Stranger LP in 1982. Negative reviews, the stresses of touring, drummer Gilson Lavis' drinking, and conflict between band members led Difford and Tilbrook to break up the band later that year, after releasing a final single, \"Annie Get Your Gun\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The title was originally Man of the Moment but this was changed when it was realised that had been used for a Norman Wisdom film. John Cleese was signed to star. \"No one will believe it but I didn't have an idea for casting,\" said Frayn. Cleese later said the script was \"the best I've ever seen. The same day it landed on my front door, I rang my agent and said, 'I have to do this.' \" \"Stimpson is a victim of circumstance,\" Cleese said. \"As the pressures increase, his behavior becomes more and more erratic.

When looking for a child actor to play the role of Stanley Yelnats, director Andrew Davis asked for a boy, who was like \"a young Tom Hanks\". Shia LaBeouf, who ended up receiving the role of Stanley, got his sense of the character from reading the film's script, then going on to read the original novel that the film was based on after getting the role. LaBeouf was simultaneously doing work for the Disney Channel show Even Stevens, and would work on his role in the film after doing his filming on Even Stevens. In the original book, Stanley is depicted as being obese, shedding considerable amounts of weight as the book progresses; however, the filmmakers chose to drop this aspect from the movie, as it would have been difficult to convincingly portray the loss of weight in a live action film. The film was shot in several locations, including in Ridgecrest, California. Due to the volatile climate, with heat inside of the holes reaching over 150\u00a0\u00b0F, the actors went through physical training with a stunt guide, in order to keep in shape for long periods of filming. Filming was a new experience for many of the child actors, particularly for LaBeouf, who had never done filming in such an unpredictable climate before. To show the seven kids' holes being dug gradually throughout the day, different \"phases\" were used, for each of which the seven holes were given different levels of deepness. For the yellow spotted lizards, fourteen bearded dragons were used, four of which were used for the main parts, and the rest of which were used as \"background atmosphere lizards\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor. A pilot episode for a potential spinoff series, K-9 and Company, was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series. Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced. Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood , set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, Dreamland, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official Doctor Who website in 2009.

As the band tried to lean towards a more hard rock sound, they felt that Johns was overemphasizing their country-influenced rock sound. Johns however felt that the Eagles were not capable of what the band wanted and told the band: \"You are not a rock-and-roll band, The Who is a rock-and-roll band, and you're not that.\"  The band\u2014Glenn Frey in particular, but not Don Henley\u2014were also unhappy with the no-drug policy of Johns during the recording; furthermore they did not feel at home recording in London. The band was concerned about the lack of success of the previous album Desperado, and were more assertive in wanting more input into the album, which Johns was unwilling to allow. The Eagles spent six weeks recording in London, with both the band and the producer becoming frustrated with each other and frequent arguments between Johns and Frey. The band then took a break, decided to find a new producer and discarded all the recordings except for two usable tracks, \"Best of My Love\" and \"You Never Cry Like a Lover\". The band relocated back to California and hired Bill Szymczyk, who had produced The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get by Joe Walsh\u2014who was also managed by their manager Irving Azoff and who would go on to join the Eagles in late 1975\u2014that interested the band. The band recorded the rest of the album at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. They were allowed more input in how the album was made and enjoyed more freedom with Szymczyk in the making of the album. Szymczyk suggested they bring in a harder-edged guitarist to add slide guitar to the song \"Good Day in Hell\". Bernie Leadon suggested his old friend Don Felder, whom they had met and jammed with on a few occasions. The band was so impressed that they invited Felder to become the fifth Eagle. The only other track on this album on which he appeared was \"Already Gone\". They credited him as a late arrival on the album's liner notes. On the difference in sound between Johns' and Szymczyk's productions, Henley said: \"There\u2019s a lot less echo with Bill, for one thing. There\u2019s more of a raw and funky presence. Glyn had a stamp he put on his records which is a deep echo that is really smooth like ice cream\". He thought that the production on the two songs that Johns produced was good and necessary. Frey, however, found that L.A. country-rock records were \"all too smooth and glassy\", and wanted a \"tougher sound\". Their friend and collaborator J. D. Souther ascribed the change of producer to \"Eagles\u2019 desire to get more of a live, thin sound on the albums\". The first two singles released were more rock-oriented; Frey was reluctant to release the Johns-produced \"Best of My Love\" as a single, and held off its release for some months. However, when it was finally released, the label had truncated the song\u2013without the band's knowledge or approval\u2013so that it would be more radio-friendly. \"Best of My Love\" would become their biggest hit thus far, and their first No. 1 on the charts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Granada was initially sceptical of producing it; the company's executive chairman and chief executive\u2014Charles Allen and Simon Shaps respectively\u2014believed that Blair would be forced to resign as Prime Minister over the impending war in Iraq, consequently leaving the story outdated. The project was believed to be \"too cerebral\" and attempts were made to persuade Morgan to develop a television series to replace Cold Feet, another Granada production. John Whiston and Andy Harries convinced Allen and Shaps otherwise, citing Granada's history of producing ground-breaking drama and film as reasons for why The Deal should be made. ITV's director of channels, David Liddiment, who supported the production, resigned in December 2002 and was replaced by Nigel Pickard, who shared the concerns of Allen and Shaps. Peter Morgan wrote his first script draft in the three weeks preceding Christmas 2002. Recent events such as the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak and the contention surrounding the September Dossier made him believe that the perceived adversity between Brown and Blair was no longer in the public consciousness. His opinion was changed when he watched the 2002 Labour Party Conference and saw a \"thunderous expression\" on Brown's face as Bill Clinton praised Blair in his speech; Morgan realised that the rivalry was not over. This draft was extremely sympathetic to Brown, focusing on what Morgan called \"Gordon's heartbreak\". Subsequent rewrites toned down this approach, though Brown still remained the \"main character\". The relationship between Brown and Blair as depicted in the script was based on that between Aaron Altman and Tom Grunick, the characters portrayed by Albert Brooks and William Hurt in Broadcast News. Morgan wanted to set the entire film in the 12 days following the death of John Smith, but the time frame was widened because the Labour Party's disastrous result at the 1992 general election was \"absolutely crucial\" to the relationship and motives of the main characters; Morgan had to show the moment Blair decided to aim to become leader of the party. Morgan and the producers engaged in a lengthy research process during script writing and editing, interviewing 40 to 50 of Brown and Blair's closest friends and advisors, as well as aides involved in the 1992 and 1997 elections. Significantly, many of the facts in the film are based on the first three chapters of James Naughtie's book The Rivals: The Intimate Portrait of a Political Marriage. The film briefly adopted The Rivals as a working title, but soon reverted to The Deal. Another title considered by Frears was Bambi and Stalin, based on a line in a speech given by Blair in 1995. Scenes set in the House of Commons chamber and committee rooms use the actual words as recorded in Hansard. In other scenes Morgan utilised dramatic licence, conceding that there was no evidence to suggest that any of the lines spoken elsewhere in the film were ever said in real life. The relationship between Brown and Blair received many thematic analogies; Morgan likened Brown's story to a \"tragedy of an over-qualified Scot, who the Labour Party probably rightly felt at the time that it could not have as its leader.\"; Despite the quote at the head of the film referring to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Frears wryly likened Brown and Blair to Beavis and Butt-head. Producer Christine Langan alluded to both Shakespearean and Biblical themes, painting Brown and Blair as Cain and Abel.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The later tradition of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era, was continued into the 20th century by Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian and European classical music. World-renowned composers of the 20th century include Alexander Scriabin, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, and later Edison Denisov, Sofia Gubaidulina, Georgy Sviridov, and Alfred Schnittke.

During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story \u2014usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Some notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired twelve episodes ; almost an entire season of seven-episode serials ; the ten-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for fourteen episodes during season 23. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a story-line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, season 16's quest for the Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy. The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher. However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-orientated episodes, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after The Highlanders . While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: Black Orchid , set in 1920s England. The early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following The Gunfighters , however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers. Of the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the most well known outside Doctor Who itself, due to the popularity of his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy works. The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with what was now called a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes , and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's eighth series, and ten episodes from the  eleventh series. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, often linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early \"classic\" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes \"Journey's End\" from 2008 and \"The Eleventh Hour\" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length. Doctor Who instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes , 45/50-minute episodes , two feature-length productions , twelve Christmas specials , and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a Doctor Who\u2013themed edition of The Proms. The 1993 two-part story, entitled Dimensions in Time, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera EastEnders and was filmed partly on the EastEnders set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief. Starting with the 2009 special \"Planet of the Dead\", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD.

Although less than 10% of the population is employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy. With industrial-scale farming, it ranks 9th in the nation in the value of crops and 18th in total value of agricultural products sold. Large farms generate the most crops. The share of people in the state employed in agriculture is comparatively high: , only two to three percent of the population of the United States is directly employed in agriculture. North Dakota has about 90% of its land area in farms with  of cropland, the third-largest amount in the nation. Between 2002 and 2007, total cropland increased by about a million acres ; North Dakota was the only state showing an increase. Over the same period,  were shifted into soybean and corn monoculture production, the largest such shift in the United States. Agriculturalists are concerned about too much monoculture, as it makes the economy at risk from insect or crop diseases affecting a major crop. In addition, this development has adversely affected habitats of wildlife and birds, and the balance of the ecosystem. The state is the largest producer in the U.S. of many cereal grains, including barley , durum wheat , hard red spring wheat , oats , and combined wheat of all types . It is the second leading producer of buckwheat . , corn became the state's largest crop produced, although it is only 2% of total U.S. production. The Corn Belt extends to North Dakota but is more on the edge of the region instead of in its center. Corn yields are high in the southeast part of the state and smaller in other parts of the state. Most of the cereal grains are grown for livestock feed. The state is the leading producer of many oilseeds, including 92% of the U.S. canola crop, 94% of flax seed, 53% of sunflower seeds, 18% of safflower seeds, and 62% of mustard seed. Canola is suited to the cold winters and it matures fast. Processing of canola for oil production produces canola meal as a by-product. The by-product is a high-protein animal feed. Soybeans are also an increasingly important crop, with  additional planted between 2002 and 2007. Soybeans are a major crop in the eastern part of the state, and cultivation is common in the southeast part of the state. Soybeans were not grown at all in North Dakota in the 1940s, but the crop has become especially common since 1998. In North Dakota soybeans have to mature fast, because of the comparatively short growing season. Soybeans are grown for livestock feed. North Dakota is the second leading producer of sugarbeets, which are grown mostly in the Red River Valley.

The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players. Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, \"violet buildings\" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game. Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger. Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Chrome SpecForce is a strike force unit of the Federal Expeditionary Corps . They are tasked with maintaining the Federation's stability and keeping order. They are used for missions such as high-profile assassination, espionage, infiltration, and sabotage of enemy territory. The protagonist of the game is Logan, a member of SpecForce. The main goal of the game is to fight a corporation engaged in criminal activity on a planet called Estrella. SpecForce's members are given the latest equipment, such as Power Armor. The game has elements of strategy, large maps, and multiplayer. The gameplay in Chrome SpecForce is largely identical to that of Chrome, although it has been streamlined, while the overall difficulty has also been lowered. The player can survive significantly more damage , healing and ammo items are more common-place, and the control scheme has been condensed so as to require fewer separate commands. The plot is also simpler; cutscenes are minimal, with most of the story told in the mission briefings. The game serves as a prequel to Chrome, featuring Bolt Logan and Ron \"Pointer\" Hertz in their days as members of the military special forces. The two are sent to the planet Estrella to perform sabotage on the LoreGen corporation, who have been producing an illegal performance-enhancing stimulant derived from the planet's native dinosaur-like predators, and selling it to the mafia. However, the mission goes awry and the two are stranded on the planet when LoreGen succeeds in destroying their ship and killing the rest of their squad, including their commanding officer. The two meet Cartwright, a member of a local resistance movement fighting against LoreGen, and ally with the resistance to battle LoreGen. Cartwright is killed in a later mission, but Logan succeeds in disabling LoreGen's computer network with a computer virus, allowing the rebels to storm LoreGen's headquarters. Logan assists Weber, the leader of the resistance, in assaulting the LoreGen HQ. In the process, Logan succeeds in destroying LoreGen's stockpile of the stimulant as well as eliminating their prototype SW4 super-soldiers, Power Armor units boosted to superhuman levels with the stimulant. Logan finally defeats LoreGen's head of security, \"General\" Stanton, allowing the rebels to take the planet. Logan and Pointer contact the authorities to clean up the situation.

Set to be directed by Anatole Litvak, this version would have been set in contemporary Paris, and would have portrayed the Phantom as a psychologically wounded World War I veteran who was physically unharmed, but imagined that he was disfigured. However, development lingered as the studio faced financial problems that resulted in the ousting of the original film's producer Carl Laemmle and his son, Carl Laemmle Jr. Plans for the remake finally surfaced again in November 1941, when Henry Koster became attached to direct. Koster discarded the previous screenplay, and envisioned a new version of the story in which the Phantom was Christine's father. Under Koster, the initial casting included Boris Karloff as The Phantom, Allan Jones as Raoul, and Deanna Durbin as Christine. Eddy was cast after leaving MGM for a two-picture deal with Universal. This led to Durbin refusing the role, not wanting to be compared to Eddy's frequent film partner Jeanette MacDonald, who Durbin admired. Karloff also became unavailable, and Koster also considered Cesar Romero, Feodor Chaliapin, Charles Laughton and Broderick Crawford for the Phantom. However, producer George Waggner eventually fired Koster from the project. After Koster's firing, Arthur Lubin was brought on to direct. Under Lubin, Koster's subplot about the Phantom being Christine's father was jettisoned, because it gave the romantic elements of their relationship incestuous overtones; however, the Phantom's obsession with Christine is not completely stated within the film. Lubin cast Rains in the film almost immediately, saying he was his \"only choice\" for the role. Foster, who had just left Paramount Pictures, was cast after meeting Lubin through a mutual friend, and auditioning for Waggner. Filming began on January 21, 1943. Lux Radio Theater presented a radio adaption of the film on September 13, 1943. Nelson Eddy, Susanna Foster and Edgar Barrier reprised their roles from the film; Basil Rathbone replaced Rains as Erique Claudin. This presentation was produced and hosted by Cecil B.

The series began in 1991 with Summoned by Shadows, co-produced with the BBC Film Club as a knowing homage to the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who and in a pragmatic attempt to take advantage of the consequent pre-existing audience. Summoned by Shadows is a Who-style tale of strange doings in an unspecified time period on Earth featuring three actors known for their roles in Doctor Who and playing similar characters. The unnamed protagonist is played by Colin Baker, his assistant Miss Brown by Nicola Bryant, who had played the Doctor's assistant Peri Brown opposite Colin Baker for two years, and the villain of the piece by Michael Wisher, who had been the first actor to play Davros. The second story, More than a Messiah, adapted the Doctor Who Audio Visuals story of the same name, but with the Stranger and Miss Brown substituted for the Doctor and companion Ria . In a further connection, it co-starred Sophie Aldred, better known as Ace from Doctor Who, and Peter Miles, who had co-starred in the TV serial Genesis of the Daleks \u2013 both in completely different roles.In Memory Alone, the third film, found the Stranger and Miss Brown stranded without their mysterious transport in a desolate train station with amnesia, and battling a robot and a mysterious man played by Nicholas Briggs .

Schwimmer, who LeBlanc thought was the \"consummate professional\", was also upset, so LeBlanc \"just lost it.\" Maggie Wheeler, who played Chandler's \"on and off\" girlfriend Janice, told People, \"the entire cast had to go back and have their makeup redone before starting,\" and that Perry broke the tension by saying, \"Somebody is gonna get fired.\" Perry told the New York Daily News that he did not cry, \"but I felt like I was about to for like seven hours.\" Although it was planned that some key scenes of the episode would be filmed without an audience to avoid leaks of plot spoilers, the producers decided not to worry about the issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience. The producers also instigated the rumor that multiple endings would be filmed; in fact, only one was planned and shot.

Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, with Criminal Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced. Later, CBS approached CSI: NY writer Peter M. Lenkov to pitch a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov himself was a fan of the original. When executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman known about the remake, the two were originally hesitant to participate, but were impressed by Lenkov's pitch, since the story had \"such a great kind of paradigm for the show and how to really get into the characters that he really talked us into it.\" All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film. The producers discussed changing Kono to a female character. Lenkov noted that the producers did not have reservations as he initially though, but instead embraced the idea, as it would empower women in the remake by including them as main characters and not just victims or other minor characters. The pilot episode of the original series already established the Five-O task force, and when writing the pilot Lenkov wanted to give a proper introduction to the characters so that the audience can get to know them. Another difference in both the original and reimagined shows was the genre; the original was more police procedural, whereas the remake would be more action orientated, as well as some comedy mixed in, particularly from the banter between McGarrett and Danny. In the original script, there was no fighting between the two main characters, but the producers felt this would launch their partnership.

The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that \"life goes on\" and end the series with \"their heads held high\". In the finale, Callum Stone has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding. The idea for the series finale came after research showed that rape is used to punish girl gang members. Series Producer Tim Key says \"That is what The Bill has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and we wanted it to be like that right up until the final shot.\" The final location shoot for the finale was carried out at a derelict estate in London which is due to be demolished.  The Bill was always filmed on location in London whenever possible, \"to keep the show authentic\".  Executive Producer Johnathan Young says \"We feel that London is a part of the show, it's a character within the show and we've really encouraged directors to look for graphic locations that give you a real sense of being part of a big metropolis\".  Examples of these would include police chases by boat along the River Thames and helicopters aiding searches. The police uniforms used in The Bill are authentic so when not in use they are locked away.  The uniforms were originally bought from the police who agreed to buy the uniforms back when the series ended.

Of the final scene, Keys said that the producers knew they had to do \"something special\" but also wanted to show that \"life goes on\".  To film the final scene, the cameraman had to keep the camera steady when following the characters going through the police station and then outside into the rear yard of the station where he stepped into a crane which then lifts to reveal the front of Sun Hill station. The shows producers were also included in the final scene, and played the part of journalists at the press conference hosted by Jack Meadows which Keys described as being \"eerie\" because \"you were sat there on the front row listening to Simon making a very moving speech that sums up the show and his time in it\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Burleson also called it a \"masterpiece\" and a \"groundbreaking pop record for the masses that continues to be transformative even today.\" Blender wrote \"[Off the Wall] was the first suggestion that disco need not be tacky\" and that the album's \"immaculately produced, pre-Thriller tracks are now too familiar to shock, but in 1979, they were revolutionary.\" With regards to the album, the magazine also wrote \"perfection is timeless.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself. Featuring West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LPs lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, named Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP . The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem described as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty. The Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality. The first single, \"My Name Is\", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while \"My Name Is\" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . While The Slim Shady LP's success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth.

Often the people who would appreciate a play are the people who cannot afford the price of admission. For a production like The Miracle to coach the people for whom it was primarily intended it must have a low price of admission.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released by Epic Records on September 9, 2014. On music provider the iTunes Store, it was later replaced by her 2015 debut major-label studio album of the same name. The EP was produced by Kevin Kadish with all of the music and lyrics written by Trainor and Kadish. Musically, the EP has a throwback style sound with its 1950s doo wop-inspired songs straddling the line between modern R&B and melodic pop.  Its lyrical composition contemplates 21st century womanhood. Title produced two singles, \"All About That Bass\", released on June 30, 2014, and \u201cDear Future Husband\u201d was released on March 17, 2015. The EP garnered mixed reviews from contemporary music critics who commended the record's production and Trainor's vocal ability, but criticized its lyrical content. The songs \"All About That Bass\" and \"Title\" were the subject of controversy among several critics who accused both songs of anti-feminism. Title debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 21,000 units, and peaked at number 17 on the Canadian Albums Chart. Furthermore, it peaked at number 35 on the Danish Albums Chart.

During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story \u2014usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Some notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired twelve episodes ; almost an entire season of seven-episode serials ; the ten-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for fourteen episodes during season 23. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a story-line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, season 16's quest for the Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy. The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher. However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-orientated episodes, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after The Highlanders . While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: Black Orchid , set in 1920s England. The early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following The Gunfighters , however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers. Of the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the most well known outside Doctor Who itself, due to the popularity of his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy works. The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with what was now called a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes , and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's eighth series, and ten episodes from the  eleventh series. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, often linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early \"classic\" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes \"Journey's End\" from 2008 and \"The Eleventh Hour\" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length. Doctor Who instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes , 45/50-minute episodes , two feature-length productions , twelve Christmas specials , and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a Doctor Who\u2013themed edition of The Proms. The 1993 two-part story, entitled Dimensions in Time, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera EastEnders and was filmed partly on the EastEnders set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief. Starting with the 2009 special \"Planet of the Dead\", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", was broadcast in 2013. In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning, and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide. In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between BBC Worldwide and SMG Pictures in China, the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. Also starring are Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, and Bill Paxton. Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Baja Studios were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200\u00a0million. Upon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved significant critical and commercial success, and later received numerous accolades. Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve for the most Oscar nominations, and won 11, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben-Hur for the most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84\u00a0billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6\u00a0million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.195\u00a0billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2\u00a0billion worldwide . In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "164_1175", "question": "Who was the producer of The Secret Game?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_26793", "text": "The original score for Secret of Mana was composed and produced by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Adventure, was originally slated for the project, but was replaced with Kikuta after he had started on other projects, such as Romancing SaGa. Secret of Mana was Kikuta's first video game score, and he encountered difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the Super NES. Kikuta tried to express in the music two \"contrasting styles\" to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24\u00a0hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, \"immersive\" and \"three-dimensional\". Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta stated in 2001 that he considered the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation. The soundtrack's music includes both \"ominous\" and \"light-hearted\" tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and \"dark, solemn pianos\". Kikuta's compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from Bali. Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, \"Fear of the Heavens\", to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game's music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a \"whale noise\", rather than a traditional \"ping\", in order to try to \"more deeply connect\" the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the Super NES was a difficult technical challenge. An official soundtrack album, Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version, was released in Japan in August 1993, containing 44 musical tracks from the game. An English version, identical to the Japanese original aside from its localized packaging and track titles, was later released in North America in December 1994 as Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, making Secret of Mana one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release outside of Japan. An album of arranged music from Secret of Mana and its sequel Seiken Densetsu 3 was produced in 1993 as Secret of Mana+. The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. Secret of Mana+ contains a single track, titled \"Secret of Mana\", that incorporates themes from the music of both Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was still under development at the time. The style of the album has been described by critics as \"experimental\", using \"strange sounds\" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and \"typing\" sounds. The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as \"Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians\". The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album. The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original Super NES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are \"how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it\", without the limitations of the Super NES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, noted that the differences were minor. Music for the 2018 remake, which features remastered versions of the original soundtrack, was overseen by Kikuta and arranged by numerous game composers, such as Yuzo Koshiro and Tsuyoshi Sekito. The soundtrack was released as an album, also titled Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, shortly after the remake's release in February 2018.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Martin said that all the concepts under discussion were prequels, although he believes the term \"successor show\" applies better to these projects, as they are not Game of Thrones spin-offs in the traditional sense. He ruled out Robert's Rebellion as a possible idea and revealed that some may be set outside Westeros. In September 2018, speaking about the four projects , HBO president of programming Casey Bloys said that some of them had been abandoned completely, while others remained as possibilities for the future; Martin said that: \"at least two of them are solidly based on material in Fire and Blood\". In May 2019, Martin stated that two of the projects were still in the script stage, but were \"edging closer\". In April 2019, Cogman confirmed his prequel would not be moving forward. In January 2021, it was revealed that HBO were developing another prequel series to be based on Martin's novella series Tales of Dunk and Egg. Steve Conrad was attached as writer and executive producer of the Tales of Dunk and Egg series in November 2021. Additionally, an animated drama is in development at HBO Max. In March 2021, it was reported that three additional Game of Thrones spinoffs were in development at HBO, they include 10,000 Ships, a reference to the voyages made by warrior queen Princess Nymeria who later founded Dorne, 9 Voyages, about the voyages of Corlys Velaryon on the Sea Snake, and a project based on Flea Bottom, the poorest slum in King's Landing.

In his 2006 book, Life After Kes, Simon Golding commented that \"Billy Casper, unlike the author [Golding], was a victim of the 11-plus. A government directive that turned out, who passed the exam, prospective white-collar workers, fresh from grammar schools, into jobs that were safe and well paid. The failures, housed in secondary modern schools, could only look forward to unskilled manual labour or the dangers of the coal face. Kes protests at this educational void that does not take into account individual skills, and suggests this is a consequence of capitalist society, which demands a steady supply of unskilled labour.\" Golding also quoted director Ken Loach who stated that, \"It [the film] should be dedicated to all the lads who had failed their 11-plus. There's a colossal waste of people and talent, often through schools where full potential is not brought out.\" In Ken Loach: The Politics of Film and Television, John Hill noted how the film's producers were against the bleak depiction of educational prospects for children in the film writing, \"Garnett [the film's producer] recalls how, in raising finance for the film, they encountered pressures to make the film's ending more positive, such as having Billy - with the help of his teacher - obtain a job at a zoo. As Garnett observes, however, this would have been to betray the film's point of view, which was concerned to raise questions about 'the system' rather than individuals.\" The film has also been noted for its themes around familial bonds during childhood and the effect their absence can have on children. Actor Andrew Garfield, who played Billy in a stage adaptation of Kes early in his career, commented that, \"Billy needs to be loved by both his mother and brother. Like any child, he instinctively loves them both. He may resent his mother for not seeming to care about him, but he cannot help but love her. This causes Billy a lot of emotional pain when his mother rejects him. With Jud the rejection is even more blatant; he goes out of his way to hurt Billy, both physically and emotionally. Billy desires approval, comfort, support, guidance and attention from his family, but he receives nothing from them. A hug from his mum would make his day. I believe that love does exist within his family but expressing it is considered to be embarrassing and inappropriate. ... I think that Kes represents to Billy the ideal relationship that he finds so difficult to have with the people around him. Billy trusts, protects and is supported by Kes. He spends all of his time thinking of Kes and day dreaming about her. Billy looks up to Kes and feels privileged to be her friend.

Initially, the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce lactase, an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk. People therefore converted milk to curd, cheese and other products to reduce the levels of lactose. Thousands of years ago, a chance mutation spread in human populations in Europe that enabled the production of lactase in adulthood. This mutation allowed milk to be used as a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed. Milk is processed into a variety of products such as cream, butter, yogurt, kefir, ice cream, and cheese. Modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein, whey protein, lactose, condensed milk, powdered milk, and many other food-additives and industrial products. Whole milk, butter and cream have high levels of saturated fat. The sugar lactose is found only in milk, and possibly in forsythia flowers and a few tropical shrubs. Lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, reaches its highest levels in the human small intestine immediately after birth, and then begins a slow decline unless milk is consumed regularly. Those groups who continue to tolerate milk have often exercised great creativity in using the milk of domesticated ungulates, not only cattle, but also sheep, goats, yaks, water buffalo, horses, reindeer and camels.

Their initial missions are on behalf of the mining corporation SPACON, battling a group of pirates that have been hijacking SPACON transport ships and have also kidnapped a nanotechlogy scientist, Dr. Shybkov. The pirates turn out to be led by Jurgen Dexon, another form special forces associate of Logan who he describes as a sadist. Logan succeeds in rescuing Dr. Shybkov, and shoots down a shuttle carrying Dexon as he attempts to escape, seemingly killing him. Later, Logan and Carrie are contracted by SPACON to help colonists on the planet Terbon fight off attacks by a gang of thugs called the Hannibals. Logan rescues the daughter of the colony's leader, John Brown, and succeeds in killing the Hannibal leader. However, he learns that a single operative has single-handedly massacred the entire SPACON corporation, effectively dissolving the company. SPACON's assets are absorbed by the larger Coretech corporation, with which they had been partners. Coretech's representative, Nicole Parker, contacts Logan and reveals that Dexon and the Hannibals were in the employ of the Zetrox corporation, who want to drive off the colonists from Terbon to seize the resources on their land. Logan embarks on Coretech's behalf to a Zetrox space station to retrieve evidence of Zetrox's illegal actions. Logan succeeds in retrieving the evidence, and escapes after a shootout with Ming Tse, Zetrox's representative. However, Nicole Parker is captured by Zetrox soldiers while on her way to delivering the evidence against Zetrox to the government. Logan succeeds in rescuing her, in the process killing Jurgen Dexon, who had survived the shuttle crash and been rebuilt by Zetrox with bionic implants and cybernetic limbs in order to lead the kidnapping operation. Coretech contacts Logan and informs him that Zetrox has developed a nanovirus using Dr. Shybkov's research, which Coretech claims Zetrox plans to use to exterminate the Terbon colonists. They hire Logan to destroy the Zetrox warehouses containing the nanovirus, while implying that Pointer is the Zetrox commander overseeing the warehouses and the mission will give Logan a chance at revenge against him. However, the mission turns out to be a double-cross; Pointer is revealed to be working for Coretech, who were the ones behind the destruction of SPACON. Logan was sent to the Zetrox facility as a distraction so Pointer and his Coretech forces could steal the nanovirus and use it on the colonists. Pointer reveals that the Terbon colonists have discovered Chrome, the most valuable resource in the universe, which is why the corporations are fighting over the planet. Logan is again left to die by Pointer, but is rescued by Nicole Parker, who defects from Coretech after learning of their duplicity. Logan and Parker travel to a Coretech facility to try and stop them from using the nanovirus; however, Parker is killed by Pointer, who escapes to Terbon with the nanovirus. Logan pursues him and succeeds in killing him just before he can deploy the nanovirus against the colonists. With Pointer dead, Logan's revenge is complete and he and Carrie are ready to wash their hands of the entire affair, when they are contacted by Zetrox, Coretech, and the Terbon colonists. Zetrox's representative Ming Tse reveals that they have used their wealth and influence to quash the evidence against them Logan gathered, and now they want to hire him to help them forcibly relocate the colonists in order to claim their Chrome-rich land; Ming Tse promises that the colonists will not be harmed, stating that Zetrox plays hard but does so transparently. Coretech, in contrast, wants to hire Logan to exterminate the Terbon colonists, threatening to release incriminating information they have on Logan to the authorities if he decides not to work for them. Finally, John Brown and the colonists want Logan to help them defend their homes from the corporations, a seemingly hopeless fight. At this point, the player can choose to side with Zetrox, Coretech, or the colonists, leading to 3 separate final missions and endings. If the player sides with Zetrox, Logan will help them defend the colony from a Coretech assault. Zetrox will forcibly relocate the colonists, leaving them without homes. Logan states that the colonists should be grateful to still be alive, and that he has no regrets. Carrie, disillusioned by the whole affair, decides to end her partnership with Logan. If the player sides with Coretech, Carrie will quit on the spot, disgusted by Logan's willingness to commit mass murder for money. Logan will kill all the armed male colonists defending the colony, finally assassinating the colonist leader John Brown. Coretech's lawyers find a way to remove Zetrox from the Valkyria system, and Coretech will congratulate Logan on his work and offer him Pointer's former position with them. If Logan sides with the colonists, the government will storm Coretech's offices, removing them from the equation. Logan then helps the colonists fight off a Zetrox assault. With her forces defeated, Ming Tse will threaten to wipe out the colony with the nanovirus unless they surrender to Zetrox's authority. Logan succeeds in disabling the nanovirus bombs, killing Ming Tse in a final showdown when she tries to stop him. The grateful colonists offer to share the wealth from their newfound Chrome with Logan and Carrie, who discuss taking a well-earned vacation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_1193", "question": "Who was the producer of Revelations?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_23445", "text": "American scholar Brad Duren argued that The Omen was part of a trend of films featuring cosmic horror that started with Rosemary's Baby in 1968, but the film was unusual at the time because it concerned the \"end times\" predicted in The Book of Revelation and used the ideology of premillennial dispensationalism favored by American fundamentalist Protestants. Duren further maintained that the box office success of The Omen, which concerned the first stages of the Apocalypse as the Antichrist is born, reflected the zeitgeist of 1970s America. In 1973, an advertising executive and evangelical Christian, Robert Munger, who had read Hal Lindsey's book The Late, Great Planet Earth, speculated to film producer Harvey Bernard about the possibility that the Antichrist might be walking the earth in the form of a child, unknown to the vast majority of humanity. This conversation inspired Bernard with the idea for the film that became The Omen. Bernard commissioned script-writer David Seltzer to write a script for the film. Seltzer in turn borrowed many ideas from premillennial dispensationalism, especially The Late, Great Planet Earth, while inventing his own. For an example, a supposed quote from the Book of Revelation featured in The Omen is a fabrication created by Seltzer. Likewise, the sinister figure who will rule the world for seven years predicted in The Book of Revelation, commonly known as the Antichrist, is not described in the Bible as the son of Satan, whereas Seltzer made Satan the father of the Antichrist in The Omen. Duren commented that it was a sign of the popularity of The Omen that ever since the film was released in 1976 it is widely believed, even by evangelical Christians, that Satan will be the father of the Antichrist despite the fact that the Bible says nothing of the sort . In the same vein, the film's portrayal of certain Catholic priests as the allies of the Antichrist owes much to fundamentalist Protestant views of the Roman Catholic Church and has nothing to do with Catholic doctrine. The \"daggers of Megiddo\", which are the only things that can kill the Antichrist in The Omen, are not mentioned in the Book of Revelation, which states that only Christ can kill the Antichrist. Finally, Duren stated that the film massively distorts the Book of Revelation by requiring Robert Thorn to kill Damien with one of the sacred daggers as the only way to avert the Apocalypse. In fact, the Book of Revelation contends that the Apocalypse will be a horrific but necessary chapter in the future that will end in the ultimate triumph of good over evil and the salvation of humanity. Duren wrote that from a fundamentalist viewpoint Damien should not be killed because his temporary rule as the dictator of the world will be followed by the eternal rule of Christ, but Seltzer needed to add dramatic tension to the story. Duren noted that Munger, who served as the religious consultant on the film, should have been aware of the film's distortions of the Bible. The success of the film in 1976 may have been due to a sense of malaise in the West at the time. As film critic John Kenneth Muir wrote: \"What if the Bible is correct? What if all the signs of the Apocalypse are happening around about now? Would we believe them? Heck, would we even notice?\" Duren wrote that though it was unlikely that most people who viewed the film in 1976 accepted the dispensationalist viewpoint, the mere feeling that the world or the West was in terminal decline gave the film a resonance that its subsequent sequels lacked. Beyond the success of the film, Duren wrote that the impact of the film on popular culture can be seen in the way that many people accept the dispensationalist reading of the Book of Revelation as the correct interpretation whereas in fact, the dispensationalist interpretation was and still is rejected by many churches. Duren wrote that dispensationalism had once been a \"fringe\" theory within Protestant theology, but due to the popularity of The Omen it is now widely accepted as doctrine. Duren noted that in the film it has to be explained to Robert Thorn that the number 666 is the \"mark of the beast\" as presumably the audiences in 1976 were not familiar with this aspect of the Book of Revelation, but because of the film's popularity, the number 666 has entered popular culture and most people, even those of a secular bent, are aware of the sinister significance attached to the number.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song then moves into the chorus, which is written in the parallel major key to the verse. The song has a sombre vocal delivery and a slow, piano-based instrumental backing. The song was written after Reed and his then fianc\u00e9e , Bettye Kronstad, spent a day in Central Park. The lyric is often considered to suggest simple, conventional romantic devotion, possibly alluding to Reed's relationship with Bettye Kronstad and Reed's own conflicts with his sexuality, drug use and ego. Some commentators have further seen the lyrical subtext as displaying Reed's romanticized attitude towards a period of his own addiction to heroin. This popular understanding of the song as an ode to addiction led to its inclusion in the soundtrack for Trainspotting, a film about the lives of heroin addicts. However, this interpretation, according to Reed himself, is \"laughable\". In an interview in 2000, Reed stated, \"No. You're talking to the writer, the person who wrote it. No that's not true.

In Suspect, she played a public defender who is both helped and romanced by one of the jurors in the homicide case she is handling. Alongside Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, she starred as one of three divorcees involved with a mysterious and wealthy visitor from hell who comes to a small New England town in the comedy horror The Witches of Eastwick. In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow in love with her fianc\u00e9's younger brother. The two last films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively.The New York Times Janet Maslin wrote Moonstruck \"offers further proof that Cher has evolved into the kind of larger-than-life movie star who's worth watching whatever she does.\" For that film, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had become one of the most bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1\u00a0million per film. That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15\u00a0million in its first year sales. In 1987, Cher signed with Geffen Records and revived her musical career with what music critics Johnny Danza and Dean Ferguson describe as \"her most impressive string of hits to date\", establishing her as a \"serious rock and roller\u00a0... a crown that she'd worked long and hard to capture\". Michael Bolton, Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child, and Richie Sambora produced her first Geffen album, Cher. Despite facing strong retail and radio airplay resistance upon its release, the album proved to be a commercial success, certified platinum by the RIAA. Cher features the rock ballad \"I Found Someone\", Cher's first US top-ten single in more than eight years. By the end of the 1980s, Cher was also receiving attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men. She had romantic relationships with actors Val Kilmer, Eric Stoltz, and Tom Cruise, hockey player Ron Duguay, film producer Josh Donen, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, and Rob Camilletti, a bagel baker 18-years her junior whom she dated from 1986 to 1989. Cher's 19th studio album Heart of Stone was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The music video for its second single, \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", caused controversy due to Cher's performance on the battleship , straddling a cannon, and wearing a leather thong that revealed her tattooed buttocks. The song topped the Australian charts for seven weeks, reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became one of Cher's most successful singles. Other songs from Heart of Stone to reach the US top ten were \"After All\", a duet with Peter Cetera, and \"Just Like Jesse James\". At the 1989 People's Choice Awards, Cher won the Favorite All-Around Female Star Award. She embarked on the Heart of Stone Tour in 1989. Most critics liked the tour's nostalgic nature and admired Cher's showmanship. Its parent television special Cher at the Mirage was filmed during a concert in Las Vegas. In her first film in three years, Mermaids , Cher paid tribute to her own mother in this story about a woman who moves her two daughters from town to town at the end of a love affair. She clashed with the film's first two directors, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and Frank Oz, who were replaced by Richard Benjamin. Believing Cher would be the star attraction, the producers allowed her creative control for the film. Mermaids was a box office success and received generally positive reviews. One of the two songs Cher recorded for the film's soundtrack, a cover version of Betty Everett's \"The Shoop Shoop Song \", topped the UK Singles Chart for five weeks. Cher's final studio album for Geffen Records, Love Hurts , stayed at number one in the UK for six weeks and produced the UK top-ten single \"Love and Understanding\". The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label \"hit years\" had been especially significant to her, \"because I was getting to do songs that I really loved\u00a0... songs that really represented me, and they were popular!\" She released the exercise book Forever Fit in 1991, followed by the 1992 fitness videos CherFitness: A New Attitude and CherFitness: Body Confidence. She embarked on the Love Hurts Tour during 1992. That year, the UK-only compilation album Greatest Hits: 1965\u20131992 peaked at number one in the country for seven weeks.

Brown turned himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire station at 6:30\u00a0p.m. and was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. The police report did not name the female in the incident as is policy, but media sources soon revealed that the victim was Rihanna. Following Brown's arrest, several commercial ads and some TV shows featuring him were suspended, his music was withdrawn from multiple radio stations, and he withdrew from public appearances, including one at the 2009 Grammy Awards, where he was replaced by Justin Timberlake and Al Green. Brown hired a crisis management team and released a statement saying, \"Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired.\" On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats. He was arraigned on April 6, 2009, and pleaded not guilty to one count of assault and one count of making criminal threats. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years of probation, and domestic violence counseling. On July 20, 2009, Brown released a two-minute video on his official YouTube page apologizing to fans and Rihanna for the assault, expressing the incident as his \"deepest regret\" and saying that he has repeatedly apologized to Rihanna and \"accepts full responsibility\". In the video, Brown said he wanted to speak out earlier about the case but was advised by his attorney not to until the legal ramifications were settled. The video was removed, but is still available online. On August 25, Brown received five years of probation. He was ordered to attend one year of domestic violence counseling and undergo six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which required him to remain 50 yards away from Rihanna, reduced to 10 yards at public events. Andy Kellman of AllMusic stated, \"A fairly substantial backlash resulted in Brown's songs being pulled from rotation on several radio stations. Ultimately, however, it had little bearing on the progress of his music and acting careers.\" On September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded Larry King Live interview, his first public interview about the matter. He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\" Brown's mother said Brown \"has never, ever been a violent person, ever\" and that she does not believe in the cycle of violence. Brown said that it is \"tough\" for him to look at the famous photograph released of Rihanna's battered face, which may be the one image to haunt and define him forever, and that he still loved her. \"I'm pretty sure we can always be friends,\" said Brown, \"and I don't know about our relationship, but I just know definitely that we ended as friends.\" He stated he did not feel that his career was over, and likened his relationship with Rihanna to Romeo and Juliet, blaming the media attention in the aftermath of the assault for driving them apart. In June 2010, Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was rejected on the grounds of him \"being guilty of a serious criminal offence\" due to his assault on Rihanna. Brown had been planning to do a tour of British cities as part of a European tour but Sony stated that due to \"issues surrounding his work visa\" the tour was to be postponed. In February 2011, at the request of Brown's lawyer, Judge Patricia Schnegg modified with Rihanna's agreement the restraining order to a \"level one order,\" allowing both singers to appear at awards shows together in the future. The following month, on March 22, 2011, during an interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America at the Times Square Studios, where he was asked about the Rihanna situation and restraining order, Brown started crying and became violent in his dressing room during a commercial break before his second performance ending that day's program, and punched a window overlooking Times Square, causing damage to it. He then took off his shirt, and after several angry confrontations with the segment producer, other show staff and building security, left the building shirtless. Following the incident, he apologized and said that he was very tired of people bringing up the incident. On July 11, 2012, Brown's community service was evaluated and he was ordered to meet a judge. The evaluation was ordered by Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg on July 10, 2012. He was scheduled to appear in court with regard to the evaluation on August 21, 2012. While conducting his community service in Virginia, however, Brown was tested positive for cannabis and appeared in court on September 25, 2012, at which time his hearing date was changed to November, to determine whether or not he had violated the terms of his court order. He reappeared in court on November 1, 2012, he attempted to address the court and was told by his lawyer, Mark Geragos, \"I don't dance; you don't talk.\" On March 20, 2015, Brown's probation ended, formally closing the felony case emanating from the Rihanna assault which happened over six years prior. In a 2017 self-documentary, Welcome to My Life, Brown goes into detail about the abusive relationship, saying he intended to marry Rihanna, but that he lost her trust after finding out that he lied about a sexual encounter with someone who worked with him, that happened prior to their relationship. He also talked about how they already had lighter episodes where they put their hands against each other during their relationship, and he gave a detailed description on how the known fight went down.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_1207", "question": "Who was the producer of Animal House?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_17759", "text": "The film inspired a short-lived half-hour ABC television sitcom, Delta House, in which Vernon reprised his role as the long-suffering, malevolent Dean Wormer. The series also included Furst as Flounder, McGill as D-Day, and Widdoes as Hoover. The pilot episode was written by the film's screenwriters, Kenney, Miller, and Ramis. Michelle Pfeiffer made her acting debut in the series , and Peter Fox was cast as Otter. Belushi's character from the film, John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky, is in the Army, but his brother, Blotto, played by Josh Mostel, transfers to Faber to carry on Bluto's tradition. Jim Belushi was asked to play the role of Blotto, but declined. Animal House inspired Co-Ed Fever, another sitcom but without the involvement of the film's producers or cast. Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters lasted only three months. The film's writers planned a film sequel set in 1967 , in which the Deltas have a reunion for Pinto's marriage in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco. The only Delta to have become a hippie is Flounder, who is now called Pisces. Later, Chris Miller and John Weidman, another Lampoon writer, created a treatment for this screenplay, but Universal rejected it because the sequel to American Graffiti, which contained some hippie-1967 sequences, had not done well. When John Belushi died, the idea was indefinitely shelved. A second attempt at a sequel was made in 1982 with producer Matty Simmons co-authoring a script which saw some of the Deltas returning to Faber College five years after the events of the film. The project got no further than a first draft script. Where Are They Now? The 2003 \"Double Secret Probation Edition\" DVD included a short film, Where Are They Now?: A Delta Alumni Update''', a mockumentary purporting that the original film had been a documentary and Landis was catching up with some of the cast . It was never shown theatrically. It shows the main Animal House characters 30 years on, following Landis to cities all over America in search of the former Deltas, Omegas, and Dean Wormer, and describes the various locales and professions the characters have settled into: Donald Schoenstein \u2013 Film editor and documentarian, New York City. Currently in his third marriage to Katy. He has a son named Otis.  Otis's face is badly marked up, reminding viewers of Donald's \"pepperoni pizza\" face alluded to in the original film. Babs Jansen \u2013 Tour guide, Universal Studios Hollywood. She mentions to Landis that she is organizing an upcoming Faber reunion, and seems to be successful at her job. Marion Wormer \u2013 Seemingly unemployed in Chicago. She tells Landis of how her husband Vernon accepted the blame for the parade debacle, and was subsequently fired, leading to their divorce. She becomes progressively more tipsy throughout the interview, eventually falling off her chair. Kent Dorfman \u2013 Executive director, Encounter Groups of Cleveland, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio. He recalls trying to diet during the 1970s with a special program requiring him to shoot up the urine of pregnant women. Robert Hoover \u2013 Assistant district attorney, Baltimore, Maryland. Hoover recounts how he quit being a public defender after he realized many of his clients were insane. He also boasts of how his legal advice was sought during the O. J. Simpson murder case. Chip Diller \u2013 Landis receives a letter from Diller, who is currently serving as a missionary in Africa. He recalls how he was prevented from going to Vietnam as his father was a prime donor to several right-wing political campaigns. When he learned of Doug Neidermeyer's fragging in Vietnam, he fell into alcoholism and despair. When he began seeing Jesus in his food, he became a born-again Christian and fell into his current profession as minister and missionary. Dean Vernon Wormer \u2013 Wormer is seen at a nursing home in Florida, under the watchful eye of a male nurse. He appears to be senile, not recognizing Landis at first , and not remembering his tenure as Dean of Faber. When Landis mentions the Deltas, Wormer erupts into a violent, profanity-laced tirade against the boys who cost him his job. He lashes out against the nurse and then physically attacks Landis, consequently knocking out the camera. Eric Stratton \u2013 Gynecologist, Beverly Hills, California. Otter is depicted as still being the affable, suave gentleman he was in his college days. He remarks that gynecology has been very enjoyable for him and that he has straightened up a bit since leaving Faber. An attractive, blonde patient in her underwear then tells Otter she's ready for her examination. Otter politely ends the interview and goes into the examination room. Daniel Simpson Day \u2013 Landis remarks in a voiceover that D-Day has been the hardest to track down for the documentary, saying that rumors have flown around, with his whereabouts ranging from a Buddhist monastery in Nepal to the Yukon Territory. Landis eventually approaches a house in Modesto, California, where a man opens the door by a crack and claims, in a Hispanic accent, \"I don't know no D-Day person! I don't know him!\" He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts out of the garage in a car. He pulls out onto the street to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off. John Blutarsky \u2013 In a final voice-over featuring a shot of the White House, Landis remarks that the viewers all know what happened to Bluto and Mandy Pepperidge: they became the President and First Lady of the United States. . Home media Animal House was released on videodisc in 1979. It was released on VHS in 1980, 1983, 1988, and 1990. In 1992, it was released in a 2-pack VHS set that included The Blues Brothers. It was first released on DVD in February 1998 in a \"bare bones\" Full Screen presentation. A 20th Anniversary Widescreen Collector's Edition DVD and a coinciding THX special edition VHS and a widescreen Signature Collection Laserdisc was released later that year, with a 45-minute documentary titled \"The Yearbook\u00a0\u2014 An Animal House Reunion\" by producer J.M. Kenny, with production notes, theatrical trailer, and new interviews with director Landis, writers Harold Ramis and Chris Miller, composer Elmer Bernstein, and stars Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Stephen Furst, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Bruce McGill, James Widdoes, Peter Riegert, Mark Metcalf and Kevin Bacon. In 2000, the collector's edition DVD was packaged along with The Blues Brothers and 1941 in a John Belushi 3-pack box set. The \"Double Secret Probation Edition\" DVD released in 2003 features cast members reprising their respective roles in a \"Where Are They Now?\" mockumentary, which posited the original film as a documentary. One major change shown in this mockumentary from the epilogue of the original film is that Bluto went on from his career in the U.S. Senate to become the President of the United States, with a voiceover on a shot of the north portico of the White House, since by then Belushi had died. This DVD also includes \"Did You Know That? Universal Animated Anecdotes\", a subtitle trivia track, the making of documentary from the Collector's Edition, MxPx \"Shout\" music video, a theatrical trailer, production notes, and cast and filmmakers biographies. The DVD was also available in both Widescreen and Full Screen formats.  In August 2006, the film was released on an HD DVD/DVD combo disc, which featured the film in a 1080p high-definition format on one side, and a standard-definition format on the opposite side.  Along with the film Unleashed, Animal House was one of Universal's first two HD/DVD combo releases, but was later discontinued in 2008 after Universal decided to switch to the Blu-ray optical disc format following the conclusion of the high-definition optical disc format war. It became available on Blu-ray optical disc on July 26, 2011. The film was released on 4K on May 18, 2021. Precursors and legacyAnimal House was a great box office success despite its limited production costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as Porky's, the Police Academy films, the American Pie films, Up the Academy , and Old School among others. One writer suggested, half-seriously, that the film's impact was such that future college students seeking to emulate Delta House's antics in real life led to \"a drop of American college students\u2019 GPA's an average of .18 grade points, per semester.\" Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are among those who have had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies. On the left-wing and counterculture side, the film included references to topical political matters like President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war, and the civil rights movement. Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in film were two non-\"college movies\", M*A*S*H, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and The Kentucky Fried Movie, a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches . At the start of Twilight Zone: The Movie , also directed by John Landis, a scene set in Vietnam includes the character Bill Connor saying \"I told you guys, we shouldn't have shot Lieutenant Neidermeyer.\" In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Animal House is first on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies. In 2000, the American Film Institute ranked the film No. 36 on 100 Years... 100 Laughs, a list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2006, Miller wrote a more comprehensive memoir of his experiences in Dartmouth's AD house in a book entitled, The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie, in which Miller recounts hijinks that were considered too risqu\u00e9 for the movie. In 2008, Empire magazine selected Animal House as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. The film was also selected by The New York Times as one of The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made. In 2012, Universal Pictures Stage Productions announced it was developing a stage musical version of the movie. Barenaked Ladies were originally announced to write the score, but they were replaced by composer David Yazbek.

{"id": "164_1211", "question": "Who was the producer of Shaft?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_17827", "text": "Shaft played a crucial part in the development of African-American advancement in Hollywood. In the creation of Shaft, there was a significant African-American presence, with director Parks, editor Hugh A. Robertson, and musical composer Isaac Hayes playing crucial roles. On the other hand, white men controlled the other important aspects of Shaft'''s production. Scenarist and writer Tidyman, writer Black, producer Freeman, and executive producers Silliphant and Lewis were all white men who heavily influenced the making of Shaft. In an analysis of Shaft, Stanly Corkin stated, \"Further, the reception of the idea of blackness also becomes various, defined by any number of subject positions, and again, those cannot be fixed to any particular racially defined place of origin.\" In other words, the perception of race depends on the viewer and thus differs between individuals. Since different representations of race appeal to different people, the film's white creators fabricated its representation of blackness in order to appeal to African American and white audiences alike. MGM was struggling financially during the making of this film, so making a profitable film was a necessity. \"Under the devious guise of providing the Black American with a new and positive image of his/her life, these films confer upon the viewer, Black or White, little more than a pretended glamour and sophistication, the empty, repetitive wasteland of ancient Hollywood traditionalism.\" Parks' decision to cast Roundtree rather than a white actor, for whom the role was written, instantly altered the presentation of race in the film. Critics, however, believed the plot was not altered enough to accommodate the change in racial dynamics. \"Mark Reid, for example, argues that Shaft is a product of the studio imagination and merely a 'black-skinned replica' of the white action hero commonly found in the detective genre.\" One way that Shaft's blackness was showcased was through his attire. Shaft was \"stylistically racialized: [He] wears clothes and affects manners that are associated with being black\". Shaft was known for his elegant garb, as he was frequently draped in leather coats and turtlenecks throughout the film. Although his smooth, classy look evoked a greater interest from viewers, it in no way represented fashion typical of the black community in that era. Further, Shaft relies upon a group of militant black nationalists in helping him complete his mission to save Bumpy's daughter. The inclusion of a group so strongly identified with the Black Power movement was clearly an effort to appeal to black audience members. However, the film presented the black nationalists as a group that failed to further the black cause, raised no awareness of the black struggle, and displayed them simply as a hired team of assailants to assist Shaft on his mission. The filming of Shaft partly in the neighborhood of Harlem also allowed the black viewer to have a deeper connection to this film. The writers portrayed Shaft as a man who clearly had a good relationship with this neighborhood, yet rejected it once he became wealthy, moving to the predominantly white area of Greenwich Village. Traditional black thought in this era was that African Americans who had been prosperous financially should invest in and give back to the communities from which they came. Instead, \"the implication is that the wise black will want to sever ties with the people of Harlem and find a place among whites.\" This point further indicates the false portrayal of race in Shaft, as a true black action hero of his time period would have been more loyal to his neighborhood. The result of this inauthentic portrayal of blackness in early 1970s blaxploitation films like Shaft had an effect on black audiences viewing them. Instead of the collective nature of the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movement in the 1960s, these films helped to usher in a decade of self-indulgence, material gain, and drug consumption. \"Equally important, Riley points out that the narratives about, and images of, blacks in these new films are no more than thematic templates reworked with black casts and updated stereotypes that reconfirm white expectations of blacks and serve to repress and delay the awakening of any real political consciousness.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable odds against an extraterrestrial craft ever locating and visiting Earth, given that stellar distances are great, and faster-than-light travel is unlikely, Feldman started to think that it was \"unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what [he]'d describe as a big tin can.\" Thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions \"giving out directions\" such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that \"in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides.\" Therefrom emerged a film treatment called The Message. The original script had more of a police procedural approach, with the alien being created by a \"bathtub geneticist\" who had just had his project aborted by the government, and a biologist who had worked on the project getting along with a police officer to search for the creature. Eventually Feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues, and instead changed the protagonists to a government team. After coining the name \"Sil,\" Feldman initially thought of forming an acronym, but in the end chose only the three-letter name after learning about the codons of the genetic code, which can be represented in groups of three letters. Sil would originally emerge from a DNA sequence manipulating human DNA, and constantly mutate as she used the human junk DNA to access \"all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that [humans] evolved through \u2013 including ones that had never developed, plus ones [Earth's scientists] don't know about that have become extinct.\" Among the research Feldman did for the script included going to sessions of UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life , talking to SETI scientists, and visiting the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to talk with researchers working on the Human Genome Project. The Message was offered to several studios, but was passed up. In 1993, Feldman reworked his ideas into a spec script. This was sent to producer Frank Mancuso, Jr., who had hired Feldman to adapt Sidney Kirkpatrick's A Cast of Killers. The producer got attracted to the creative possibilities as the film offered \"the challenge of walking that fine line between believability and pushing something as far as it can go.\" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer got interested on the project, and while Feldman had some initial disagreements on the budget, after considering other studios he signed with MGM.  In turn, the now retitled Species attracted director Roger Donaldson, who was attracted to its blend of science fiction and thriller. The script underwent eight different drafts, written over an eight-month period, before Donaldson was content that flaws in the story's logic had been corrected. At one point another writer, Larry Gross, tried his hand with the script, but ultimately all the work was done by Feldman. Feldman would remain as a co-producer. While the initial Species script suggested a love triangle between Sil and two government team members, the dissatisfaction of the crew eventually led to changes to the ending, which ended up featuring Sil having a baby that would immediately prove dangerous. When Donaldson was announced as the director in 1994, Mancuso stated that most of the $35\u00a0million budget would be spent on effects, as \"It's not a movie that calls for stars. We're going to try and put as much money as we can below the line and allow the effects and the creature to be the highlights of the film.\" The lesser emphasis on actors included a newcomer as the human version of the creature, Sil, former model Natasha Henstridge.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_1214", "question": "Who was the producer of The Cruise?", "ctxs": [{"id": "218_36920", "text": "In 1985, Badalamenti was composing the score for David Lynch's Blue Velvet, as well as serving as the vocal coach for the film's star, Isabella Rossellini. A key scene in Blue Velvet was intended to feature This Mortal Coil's version of \"Song to the Siren\" by Tim Buckley, but when the rights to the song proved prohibitively expensive, it was suggested that Badalamenti compose a pop song in the same style, with lyrics written by Lynch. Because the song required a vocalist with a haunting, ethereal voice, Badalamenti recommended Cruise, who had sung in a New York theater workshop Badalamenti had produced. The result of their initial collaboration was \"Mysteries of Love\", which figures prominently in Blue Velvet'''s closing scenes and gained a cult following. Badalamenti and Lynch went on to write and produce additional songs for Cruise, most of which were featured in her debut album, Floating into the Night . The album was released on 12 September 1989 by Warner Bros. Records, and charted on Billboard the following year. It also provided musical material for Lynch's Industrial Symphony No. 1, in which Cruise performed while \"floating\" from a harness dozens of feet above a stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The second, more significant project was the soundtrack to Lynch's Twin Peaks, for which Badalamenti composed the original score. The song \"Falling\", which became the orchestral theme for the television series, caused a minor sensation, winning a Grammy at the 33rd Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental. The Twin Peaks soundtrack, featuring Cruise on the songs \"Into the Night\" and \"The Nightingale\" as well as on the vocal version of \"Falling\", eventually went gold in the US, a rare feat for a television soundtrack. Cruise made a number of appearances on Twin Peaks as a singer at a local bar, and was prominently featured in both the show's landmark pilot episode and the episode where Laura Palmer's murderer is revealed, as well as in 1992's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\", the second single from Floating into the Night, was released in 1990 and was also featured in an episode of Twin Peaks along with \"The World Spins\"; in the episode, several of the main female characters are shown lip-synching to \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart.\" Cruise reinterpreted and sang the theme song for an episode of the USA Network show Psych. The episode, \"Dual Spires\", was about a secluded town full of secrets and skeletons while they investigate the murder of a girl. It aired 20 years to the day after Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed. Cruise appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 12, 1990, filling in along with Spanic Boys on short notice when scheduled performer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor refused to appear on the same show as guest host Andrew Dice Clay. Cruise performed \"Falling.\" The following year, Cruise recorded a Lynch- and Badalamenti-produced cover of the Elvis Presley song \"Summer Kisses, Winter Tears\" for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders's Until the End of the World. Afterward, Cruise maintained a relatively low profile until her second album, The Voice of Love, was released in 1993. An instrumental version of \"She Would Die for Love\" was used as the main theme for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\"She Would Die for Love\" was also covered by alternative metal band Fant\u00f4mas on their The Director's Cut album as \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\". Cruise's early collaborations with Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch were closely related to Lynch's film work, and their lyrics often reflect this. For example, \"Into the Night\" begins with the whispered words \"Now it's dark\", a line which was repeatedly spoken by Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper's character, in Blue Velvet. Lynch also photographed Cruise for the liner notes of Floating Into the Night and The Voice of Love, and created the sculptures featured on the covers of both albums. In 2017 she appeared in Part 17 of the new Twin Peaks season performing 'The World Spins'. Cruise released the EP Three Demos in 2018, containing the original demo versions of \"Floating\", \"Falling\" and \"The World Spins\".", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_1215", "question": "Who was the producer of In Your Mind?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_10089", "text": "The band underwent another stylistic change with the recording of Signals in 1982. While Lee's synthesizers had been featured instruments ever since the late 1970s, keyboards were shifted from the background to the melodic front-lines in songs like \"Countdown\" and the lead-off track \"Subdivisions\". Both feature prominent lead synthesizer lines with minimalistic guitar chords and solos. Other previously unused instrument additions were seen in the song \"Losing It\", featuring collaborator Ben Mink on electric violin. Signals also represented a drastic stylistic transformation apart from instrumental changes. The album contained Rush's biggest hit single, \"New World Man\", while other more experimental songs such as \"Digital Man\", \"The Weapon\", and \"Chemistry\" expanded the band's use of ska, reggae, and funk. The second single, \"Subdivisions\" reached No. 36 in Canada and No. 5 on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart. Both singles reached the Top 50 in the UK. Signals became the group's second No. 1 album in Canada, their third straight No. 3 album in the UK, and peaked at No. 10 in the US, while continuing their moderate success in the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway making the Top 30 in each country. Although the band members consciously decided to move in this overall direction, creative differences between the band and long-time producer Terry Brown began to emerge. The band felt dissatisfied with Brown's studio treatment of Signals, while Brown was becoming more uncomfortable with the increased use of synthesizers in the music. Ultimately, Rush and Brown parted ways in 1983, and the experimentation with new electronic instruments and varying musical styles would come into further play on their next studio album. The style and production of Signals were augmented and taken to new heights on Grace Under Pressure . It was Peart who named the album, as he borrowed the words of Ernest Hemingway to describe what the band had to go through after making the decision to leave Terry Brown. Producer Steve Lillywhite, who gained fame with successful productions of Simple Minds and U2, was enlisted to produce Grace Under Pressure. He backed out at the last moment, however, much to the ire of Lee, Lifeson and Peart. Lee said \"Steve Lillywhite is really not a man of his word\u00a0... after agreeing to do our record, he got an offer from Simple Minds, changed his mind, blew us off\u00a0... so it put us in a horrible position.\" Rush eventually hired Peter Henderson to co-produce and engineer the album instead. Musically, although Lee's use of sequencers and synthesizers remained the band's cornerstone, his focus on new technology was complemented by Peart's adaptation of Simmons electronic drums and percussion. Lifeson's contributions on the album were decidedly enhanced, in response to the minimalist role he played on Signals. Still, many of his trademark guitar textures remained intact in the form of open reggae chords and funk and new-wave rhythms. Grace Under Pressure reached the Top 5 in Canada and the UK plus the Top 10 in the US. It became the highest charter to that date in Sweden , while becoming their first album to chart in Germany and Finland . While \"Distant Early Warning\" was not a success on Top 40 radio it peaked at No. 5 on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. With new producer Peter Collins, the band released Power Windows and Hold Your Fire . The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee's multi-layered synthesizer work. While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the mid-to-late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and thin leads. Power Windows went to No. 2 in Canada while peaking at No. 9 and 10 in the UK and US, respectively. The lead track, \"Big Money\" made the Top 50 in Canada, the UK and US, plus No. 4 on the US Mainstream Rock Chart. Hold Your Fire represents both an extension of the guitar style found on Power Windows, and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush. Hold Your Fire only went gold in the US whereas the previous five Rush albums had gone platinum, although it managed to peak at number 13 on the Billboard 200. and made the Top 10 in Canada, the UK and Finland. Two tracks from Hold Your Fire, \"Force Ten\" and \"Time Stand Still\", both peaked at No. 3 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. A third live album and video, A Show of Hands , was also released by Anthem and Mercury following the Power Windows and Hold Your Fire tours, demonstrating the aspects of Rush in the '80s. A Show of Hands met with strong fan approval, but Rolling Stone critic Michael Azerrad dismissed it as \"musical muscle\" with 1.5 stars, claiming Rush fans viewed their favourite power trio as \"the holy trinity\". Nevertheless, A Show of Hands reached the gold album mark in the US and the platinum level in Canada. At this point, the group decided to change international record labels from Mercury to Atlantic. After Rush's departure in 1989, Mercury released a double platinum two-volume compilation of their Rush catalogue, Chronicles .", "hasanswer": false}]}

French education is centralised and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as near OECD average in 2018. France was one of the PISA-participating countries where school children perceived some of the lowest levels of support and feedback from their teachers. School children in France reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to other OECD countries. Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school and elementary school . Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialisation and development of a basic grasp of language and numbers. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges and leads to the national certificate . The second is offered in high schools and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate or certificate of professional competence .

She follows the nurse down and finds the hospital morgue, room 22. The nurse emerges from the room and says, \"Room for one more, honey.\" Liz screams, flees to the elevator, and the dream ends. Liz insists the dream is really happening to her, although her agent, Barney, seems doubtful. Her doctor also tries to assure her this is impossible.  He produces the night nurse who attends the morgue, and the woman looks nothing like the figure from Liz's dream. The doctor suggests Liz try an experiment in lucid dreaming and alter one detail of the dream to undo its hold over her; specifically, to not reach for the glass upon \"waking\". Barney is very encouraging of this approach, but Liz orders him to leave, seeing his behavior as patronizing. That night, the dream begins again.  Liz visualizes a pack of cigarettes next to the glass of water on the nightstand.  When the clock awakens her, she reaches for a cigarette instead of the glass. She drops the lighter, and while reaching to retrieve it, her other hand knocks the glass to the floor.

Because of this incident, the film's release was delayed to 27 September 2013. The film's female lead, Samantha, as well as other celebrities such as Siddharth, Harish Shankar, S. S. Rajamouli, Ram Gopal Varma and Nithiin, condemned the unauthorised distribution act. However, police initially suspected that the incident might be a publicity stunt enacted by people who invested in the film. On being informed about the alleged sale of the movie in different electronic formats in the CD and mobile shops in Pedana town, Superintendent of Police J. Prabhakara Rao deployed a special team, led by Pedana Rural Circle Inspector A. Pallapu Raju, to investigate the issue. The police launched a hunt for unlicensed compact discs in the CD shops across the district. CDs and hard disks from video parlours and shops renting CDs in the Krishna district were seized, and some of the shop owners were taken into custody for questioning. Kalyan's fans went out into the streets, with signs containing slogans protesting the piracy. Subsequent to their investigation, the police arrested five people, in addition to production assistant Cheekati Arunkumar, and recovered several illegitimate copies of the film on 20 September 2013. Arunkumar had worked as a production assistant for the films Oosaravelli and Ongole Gittha , both of which were produced by B. V. S. N. Prasad. Prabhakara Rao told the media that Arunkumar had given a copy of the DVD to his friend and Hyderabad-based APSP constable, Katta Ravi, who sent it to his friend, V. Sudheer Kumar, on 14 September 2013. Pedana-based videographer Poranki Suresh got the DVD from Sudheer Kumar, and later gave it to Kollipalli Anil Kumar, who owns the Devi Mobiles and Cell repair shop in Pedana. Anil Kumar had uploaded the two-part movie into his system, and sold the 60-minute part-one of the movie to his customers in different formats. Anil Kumar deleted the original file in his system after learning about the police raids. However, he confessed to the crime during the investigation.

As pope, Gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel. Gregory is known for his extensive administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at Rome. The poor were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the Lombards. The philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward. He received lavish donations from the wealthy families of Rome, who, following his own example, were eager, by doing so, to expiate their sins. He gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse. He wrote in letters: \"I have frequently charged you ... to act as my representative ... to relieve the poor in their distress ....\" and \"... I hold the office of steward to the property of the poor ....\" In Gregory's time, the Church in Rome received donations of many different kinds: consumables such as food and clothing; investment property: real estate and works of art; and capital goods, or revenue-generating property, such as the Sicilian latifundia, or agricultural estates. The Church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor: associated with each of the main city churches was a diaconium or office of the deacon. He was given a building from which the poor could apply for assistance at any time. The circumstances in which Gregory became pope in 590 were of ruination. The Lombards held the greater part of Italy. Their depredations had brought the economy to a standstill. They camped nearly at the gates of Rome. The city itself was crowded with refugees from all walks of life, who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life. The seat of government was far from Rome in Constantinople and appeared unable to undertake the relief of Italy. The pope had sent emissaries, including Gregory, asking for assistance, to no avail. In 590, Gregory could wait for Constantinople no longer. He organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief. In doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting, which was not to be invented for centuries. The church already had basic accounting documents: every expense was recorded in journals called regesta, \"lists\" of amounts, recipients and circumstances. Revenue was recorded in polyptici, \"books\". Many of these polyptici were ledgers recording the operating expenses of the church and the assets, the patrimonia. A central papal administration, the notarii, under a chief, the primicerius notariorum, kept the ledgers and issued brevia patrimonii, or lists of property for which each rector was responsible. Gregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not. In a letter to a subordinate in Sicily he wrote: \"I asked you most of all to take care of the poor. And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out ... I desire that you give the woman, Pateria, forty solidi for the children's shoes and forty bushels of grain ....\" Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble. Money, however, was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine. Even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas. The church now owned between  of revenue-generating farmland divided into large sections called patrimonia. It produced goods of all kinds, which were sold, but Gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to Rome for distribution in the diaconia. He gave orders to step up production, set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out. At the bottom was the rusticus who produced the goods. Some rustici were or owned slaves. He turned over part of his produce to a conductor from whom he leased the land. The latter reported to an actionarius, the latter to a defensor and the latter to a rector. Grain, wine, cheese, meat, fish and oil began to arrive at Rome in large quantities, where it was given away for nothing as alms. Distributions to qualified persons were monthly. However, a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved , with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer. These and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the Roman people. They now looked to the papacy for government, ignoring the state at Constantinople. The office of urban prefect went without candidates. From the time of Gregory the Great to the rise of Italian nationalism the papacy was the most influential presence in Italy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Sawa portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a premonition of a catastrophic plane explosion. He and several of his classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but Death later takes the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane. The film began as a spec script written by Reddick for an episode of The X-Files, in order for Reddick to get a TV agent. A colleague at New Line Cinema persuaded Reddick to write it as a feature-length film. Later, Wong and Morgan, The X-Files writing partners, became interested in the script and agreed to rewrite and direct the film, marking Wong's film directing debut. Filming took place in New York City and Vancouver, with additional scenes filmed in Toronto and San Francisco. It was released on March 17, 2000, and became a financial success, making $10 million on its opening weekend. The DVD release of the film, released on September 26, 2000, in the United States and Canada, includes commentaries, deleted scenes, and documentaries. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Positive reviews praised the film for \"generating a respectable amount of suspense\", \"playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing\", \"an unexpectedly alert teen-scream disaster chiller\", and Sawa's performance, while negative reviews described the film as \"dramatically flat\" and \"aimed at the teen dating crowd\". It received the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Sawa's performance.

For years, Carey's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads, devoid of any guest appearances or hip hop-influenced melodies. In January 1995, as she recorded Daydream, Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences. She enlisted the production skills and rap styles of Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was featured on the remix of her song \"Fantasy.\" While Mottola was hesitant at first, Carey's persistence paid off when the song became an international chart topper, with critics calling the collaboration one of the pioneering songs of pop and R&B musical collaborations. During the recording and production of Carey's Butterfly in 1997, she and Mottola separated, giving Carey an extended amount of control over the unfinished album. Following their separation, Carey began working with younger hip hop and R&B producers and songwriters, aside from her usual work with balladeers Walter Afanasieff and Kenneth Edmonds. While the album incorporated several different genres and components that were not present in Carey's previous releases, Butterfly also included a balance of her classic ballads and newer R&B-infused jams. While Sony accepted Carey's new collaborations with writers and producers such as P. Diddy and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, they continued to focus their promotion on the ballads.

{"id": "164_1233", "question": "Who was the producer of Do the Right Thing?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_12594", "text": "Development of the film began in the mid-1970s when producers David Foster and Lawrence Turman suggested to Universal Pictures an adaptation of the 1938 John W. Campbell novella Who Goes There?. It had been loosely adapted once before in Howard Hawks's and Christian Nyby's 1951 film The Thing from Another World, but Foster and Turman wanted to develop a project that stuck more closely to the source material. Screenwriters Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins held the rights to make an adaptation, but passed on the opportunity to make a new film, so Universal obtained the rights from them. In 1976, Wilbur Stark had purchased the remake rights to 23 RKO Pictures films, including The Thing from Another World, from three Wall Street financiers who did not know what to do with them, in exchange for a return when the films were produced. Universal in turn acquired the rights to remake the film from Stark, resulting in him being given an executive producer credit on all print advertisements, posters, television commercials, and studio press material. John Carpenter was first approached about the project in 1976 by co-producer and friend Stuart Cohen, but Carpenter was mainly an independent film director, so Universal chose The Texas Chain Saw Massacre director Tobe Hooper as they already had him under contract. The producers were ultimately unhappy with Hooper and his writing partner Kim Henkel's concept. After several more failed pitches by different writers, and attempts to bring on other directors, such as John Landis, the project was put on hold. Even so, the success of Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction horror film Alien helped revitalize the project, at which point Carpenter became loosely attached following his success with his influential slasher film Halloween . Carpenter was reluctant to join the project, for he thought Hawks's adaptation would be difficult to surpass, although he considered the film's monster to be unnotable. Cohen suggested that he read the original novella. Carpenter found the \"creepiness\" of the imitations conducted by the creature, and the questions it raised, interesting. He drew parallels between the novella and Agatha Christie's mystery novel And Then There Were None , and noted that the story of Who Goes There? was \"timely\" for him, meaning he could make it \"true to [his] day\" as Hawks had in his time. Carpenter, a fan of Hawks's adaptation, paid homage to it in Halloween, and he watched The Thing from Another World several times for inspiration before filming began. Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey first worked together on Halloween, and The Thing was their first big-budget project for a major film studio. After securing the writer and crew, the film was stalled again when Carpenter nearly quit, believing that a passion project of his, El Diablo , was on the verge of being made by EMI Films. The producers discussed various replacements including Walter Hill, Sam Peckinpah and Michael Ritchie, but the development of El Diablo was not as imminent as Carpenter believed, and he remained with The Thing. Universal initially set a budget of $10million, with $200,000 for \"creature effects\", which at the time was more than the studio had ever allocated to a monster film. Filming was scheduled to be completed within 98 days. Universal's production studios estimated that it would require at least $17million before marketing and other costs, as the plan involved more set construction, including external sets and a large set piece for the original scripted death of Bennings, which was estimated to cost $1.5million alone. As storyboarding and designs were finalized, the crew estimated they would need at least $750,000 for creature effects, a figure Universal executives agreed to after seeing the number of workers employed under Rob Bottin, the special make-up effects designer. Associate producer Larry Franco was responsible for making the budget work for the film; he cut the filming schedule by a third, eliminated the exterior sets for on-site shooting, and removed Bennings's more extravagant death scene. Cohen suggested reusing the destroyed American camp as the ruined Norwegian camp, saving a further $250,000. When filming began in August, The Thing had a budget of $11.4million, and indirect costs brought it to $14million. The effects budget ran over, eventually totaling $1.5million, forcing the elimination of some scenes, including Nauls's confrontation of a creature dubbed the \"box Thing\". By the end of production, Carpenter had to make a personal appeal to executive Ned Tanen for $100,000 to complete a simplified version of the Blair-Thing. The final cost was $12.4million, and overhead costs brought it to $15million.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Producers needed a script for a sequel  but James Wan and Leigh Whannell, director and writer of Saw, were working on Universal Pictures's Dead Silence. Music video director Darren Lynn Bousman had just completed a script for his first film The Desperate, and was trying to sell it to studios but was getting reactions that the script was very similar to Saw. A German studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce the film for $1 million. Just as they were looking for a cinematographer, the American cinematographer David A. Armstrong, who had worked on Saw, arrived on the scene and suggested showing the script to Saw producer Gregg Hoffman. Hoffman read the script and called Bousman wanting to produce The Desperate. Bousman was initially upset when he heard about his script's similarities to Saw, and feared at first that Lions Gate's call was due to complaints of plagiarism. After Hoffman showed the script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules, the two decided that The Desperate was the starting script they needed for Saw II and two months later, Bousman was flown to Toronto to direct. Whannell polished the script, with input from Wan, in order to bring it into the Saw universe, but kept the characters, traps and deaths from The Desperate script. Bousman said, \"But you could read the script for The Desperate and watch Saw II, and you would not be able to draw a comparison\". Bousman's first draft for The Desperate consisted in an X-rated violent film, but after Bousman's agent found difficult to have the script bought because most studios were turned off due to the level of violence, Bousman modified his script to be an R-rated film, which is when the executives of Lions Gate were turned on his potential. Overall, the framework of The Desperate had a similar bleak, disgusting atmosphere and a twist ending, which is why the Lions Gate executives found parallels in the script's style. Wan and Whannell also served as executive producers. All the previous film's crew members returned: editor Kevin Greutert, cinematographer Armstrong, and composer Charlie Clouser. This was to be Hoffman's last film. He died unexpectedly on December 4, 2005. Only those key cast and crew members who were involved in the film's ending were given the full script; the rest received only the first 88 pages. If a particular page was rewritten, the old page was shredded. Members were also required to sign confidentiality agreements requiring them not to release any plot details. Reportedly, \"four or five\" alternate endings were shot in order to keep the ending a surprise. Bousman gave the actors freedom to change dialogue in the script. He said that 95% of the time, the actors went by the script, with about 5% being adlibs, which he said \"made all of the difference in the world\". Donnie Wahlberg was allowed to modify some pieces of dialogue, especially those of Eric Matthews' interactions with his son Daniel and Jigsaw. For the former, Wahlberg added the line of what was the last thing Eric told Daniel basing it on what he says to his first son before hanging up the phone. For the latter, Wahlberg felt that the relationship between Eric and Jigsaw was \"too dicey\" and should emphasize Eric's need to sit with Jigsaw to rescue his son; Tobin Bell agreed with most of these changes, which Wahlberg added after finishing shooting every day, and the two improsived together on set. Hoffman said in an interview with Fangoria that they listened to fans' suggestions. For instance, instead of only showing the aftermath of a character violently dying in a flashback, they would allow it to unfold as it happened. This was in contrast to Saw, in which most of the violence was implied off-screen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ho had argued that to ensure success in his films, Chan should play to his fanbase by only doing action movies and avoiding the love scenes that may alienate certain markets . Ho died on 16 February 1998 and Chan left Golden Harvest soon after, seeking a change and a new freedom to make the films he really wanted to. This coincided with his growing fame in the West, due to the international success of the film Rush Hour. Gorgeous was originally conceived purely as a love story, with Chan as producer, but not as one of the film's cast. In order to secure the actress Shu Qi, the script of the film was re-written and a role for Chan was created. This soon developed into a starring role, and elements of action crept in. However, Gorgeous remains primarily a romantic comedy and so it differs from his usual all-out action films. The action scenes are fewer and there is no real bad guy character \u2013 the fight with the nominal enemy is a pre-arranged bout and both fighters wear boxing gloves \u2013 competitive rather than motivated by revenge or the fight for survival. The director had wanted to use Chan's office as the set for C.N.'s apartment, but this proved impractical, particularly as that section of the office is on the third floor. However, many props from Chan's office were used including his own training dummy. Chan said of his character C.N., that he was \"60-70% Jackie Chan\". The clothing the character wears, the training routine he undergoes and healthy lifestyle he maintains, his general good nature and his environmental role are all traits and actions of Chan himself. Chan summarised the difference between the films Rush Hour and Gorgeous, stating the former was a job, and the latter was his baby. In Rush Hour his role was restricted to actor and action director. In Gorgeous, he was also the producer, editor and was involved in casting. Although a romantic comedy, the only significant kissing scene was dropped from the main film for fear that it would alienate certain East Asian markets who may not want to see Chan in such a relationship. The underwater kiss scene was retained and appeared amongst the out-takes that accompany the film's closing credits. The film is notable for casting numerous, then, unknown actors who went on to achieve national and in some cases multi-national success.  These include: Sam Lee, Daniel Wu, Richie Jen and Stephen Fung", "hasanswer": false}]}

Instead of first creating a storyboard on which the animation would be based, he conceived the theme after interviews with Larkin. After the screenplay was developed, the production followed a more typical process of creating a storyboard, character modelling, scene design, animation, and post-production. In February 2001, Landreth contacted producer Steven Hoban at Copper Heart Entertainment. Hoban liked the concept for the film, and wanted to include it as a 3D rendering in the IMAX film CyberWorld he was producing. A manager rejected the idea, as the subject material was deemed to be inappropriate for CyberWorld's young target audience. A production team was assembled with Copper Heart Entertainment, and it received a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts. The National Film Board of Canada agreed to be a co-producer. Landreth also secured studio space at the Animation Arts Centre of Seneca College in Toronto, and in 2003 four graduates and fifteen undergraduates from its 3D Animation program were recruited to work on the film. The core development team consisted of one computer graphics supervisor, four animators, one texture mapper, one renderer, two set modellers, and a few character modellers. In the summer of 2001, he conducted several interviews with Larkin, who gave Landreth carte blanche for the project. Landreth accumulated about 20 hours of audio footage, but did not think it was sufficient material on which to base a story, so in August he interviewed him again, this time asking about his alcoholism. Larkin, who had been drinking throughout the interview, responded angrily, and this would become the \"climactic moment in the film\". This led Landreth to change the production from a story primarily narrated by Larkin to an interview-style cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary in which Landreth's character had a larger role. Landreth acquired a comprehensive set of Larkin's works from the National Film Board of Canada and other reference material. He also conducted interviews with Felicity Fanjoy, who had been Larkin's girlfriend in the past, and Derek Lamb, who directed films at the NFB and was a producer for Larkin in the 1970s. He used the interviews and reference material to create a script, which he completed by December. The animation used the technique of psychological realism, blending dialogue from interviews with subjective screen characters who are \"sometimes fragmented, distorted, or in some way unusual\". The representation of the characters was partly inspired by Body Worlds, a travelling exhibition of human bodies preserved by plastination to reveal internal anatomical structures. Landreth has stated that Larkin's character in the film is a subjective interpretation based on his own ideology and experiences, citing one of his favourite quotations \"we don't see things as they are, we see things as we are\". He animated Larkin as a beaten character \"battered by years of substance abuse and still bearing the scars of his artistic failure\". Landreth stated that the visual appearance of the characters \"reflect pain, insanity, fear, mercy, shame, and creativity\", and that the effect was to show the characters' \"souls or mental states or psyches\". Landreth incorporated Larkin's alcoholism as part of the narrative of the film, at first in the background as Larkin sips from a thermos, and later directly as Landreth asks Larkin about his alcoholism. The attention to Larkin's alcoholism also reflects Landreth's mother's troubles with alcohol. Pre-production and production took about 18 months. Use of the Seneca College computing infrastructure, which was loaned for free for the production, was valued by NFB producer Marcy Page at about . Intel donated the use of a render farm for the production. The overall cost to produce Ryan was about . The film was dedicated to Landreth's mother, Barbara.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As the band tried to lean towards a more hard rock sound, they felt that Johns was overemphasizing their country-influenced rock sound. Johns however felt that the Eagles were not capable of what the band wanted and told the band: \"You are not a rock-and-roll band, The Who is a rock-and-roll band, and you're not that.\"  The band\u2014Glenn Frey in particular, but not Don Henley\u2014were also unhappy with the no-drug policy of Johns during the recording; furthermore they did not feel at home recording in London. The band was concerned about the lack of success of the previous album Desperado, and were more assertive in wanting more input into the album, which Johns was unwilling to allow. The Eagles spent six weeks recording in London, with both the band and the producer becoming frustrated with each other and frequent arguments between Johns and Frey. The band then took a break, decided to find a new producer and discarded all the recordings except for two usable tracks, \"Best of My Love\" and \"You Never Cry Like a Lover\". The band relocated back to California and hired Bill Szymczyk, who had produced The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get by Joe Walsh\u2014who was also managed by their manager Irving Azoff and who would go on to join the Eagles in late 1975\u2014that interested the band. The band recorded the rest of the album at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. They were allowed more input in how the album was made and enjoyed more freedom with Szymczyk in the making of the album. Szymczyk suggested they bring in a harder-edged guitarist to add slide guitar to the song \"Good Day in Hell\". Bernie Leadon suggested his old friend Don Felder, whom they had met and jammed with on a few occasions. The band was so impressed that they invited Felder to become the fifth Eagle. The only other track on this album on which he appeared was \"Already Gone\". They credited him as a late arrival on the album's liner notes. On the difference in sound between Johns' and Szymczyk's productions, Henley said: \"There\u2019s a lot less echo with Bill, for one thing. There\u2019s more of a raw and funky presence. Glyn had a stamp he put on his records which is a deep echo that is really smooth like ice cream\". He thought that the production on the two songs that Johns produced was good and necessary. Frey, however, found that L.A. country-rock records were \"all too smooth and glassy\", and wanted a \"tougher sound\". Their friend and collaborator J. D. Souther ascribed the change of producer to \"Eagles\u2019 desire to get more of a live, thin sound on the albums\". The first two singles released were more rock-oriented; Frey was reluctant to release the Johns-produced \"Best of My Love\" as a single, and held off its release for some months. However, when it was finally released, the label had truncated the song\u2013without the band's knowledge or approval\u2013so that it would be more radio-friendly. \"Best of My Love\" would become their biggest hit thus far, and their first No. 1 on the charts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world. Joey's catchphrase, \"How you doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech. Friends has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, BTS member RM and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters. Friends is parodied in the twelfth season Murder, She Wrote episode \"Murder Among Friends.\" In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher investigates the murder of a writer for Buds, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved Murder, She Wrote from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite Friends on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and Murder, She Wrotes supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\" Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of Buds by watching episodes of Friends. Producers of Married... with Children attempted to create a spinoff series called Enemies, which was intended to act as an antithesis to Friends in the same way Married... with Children had been to family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show. However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series. The Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by Friends, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses also contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing Friends episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai caf\u00e9, where he worked as a waiter. Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004. From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold real coffee to customers and featured a display of Friends memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football.\" In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010. In India, there are six Friends-themed cafes, located in Chandigarh ; Kolkata; and West Bengal , which features many icons from the original T.V. series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra. There are two Friends themed cafes in Pakistan as wellone in Lahore, Punjab known as \"Friends Cafe\" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called \"Central Perk\". Both of those cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and even episode reruns on a projector. They're also planning to have their own Gunther at the bar. In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The caf\u00e9 also includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show. In August 2019, it was announced that a Central Perk Lego set would be launched to mark the show's 25 anniversary. Friends has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \"all you need are good friends\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other. Vox stated that Friends impacted the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits.

It [October 1] was pieced together wonderfully and creatively executed. October 1 is a must see for all\". Wilfred Okiche of YNaija praised its production design, and concluded: \"In many ways, October 1 is a typical Kunle Afolayan film, what with the ensemble cast, big budget, period setting, ambitious story and dark psychological suspense. But where he does not leave an indelible mark on the film, one that will in future days be identified as the Afolayan touch. He proves once again and maybe for the first time in film this year, that ambition is good and no one can represent Nigeria better than Nigerians. Nollywood is rising indeed, and October 1 is a shining example\". Amarachukwu Iwuala of Pulse NG praised the subtle themes in the film, while noting Kayode Olaiya as the highlight performance, and concluded that although \"October 1 is not fast-paced, the action nonetheless unravels at a rate that keeps everyone in suspense. The film aptly integrates several interesting subplots; smartly employing subtext and irony. This 140-minute picture is another feat for Nollywood\". Augustine Ogwo of News Wire comments: \"October 1 is brilliant, thought-provoking and timeless. October 1 preaches the truth and it does so from an artistic point of view. Kudos must be given to Tunde Babalola for writing such an amazing script and also to the producer/director of this movie for breathing life into the story. October 1 is such a good movie that it has the power to plunge every well meaning Nigerian into a reflective mood and possibly positive action\". Isabella Akinseye of Nolly Silver Screen gave a mixed review; while praising the cinematography and generally the production, she talked down on the plot and scripting. She rated the film 3.4 out of 5 stars and commented: \"As a film that attempts to teach Nigeria\u2019s history through entertainment, Kunle Afolayan\u2019s October 1 gets a pass. Brand Nigeria is depicted in the language, props and footage, but the problem with the film is that it tries to do too many things\".

In the same vein, British scholar Charles Francis Keary suggests that Hera had some sort of \"Earth Goddess\" worship in ancient times, connected to her possible origin as a Pelasgian goddess . According to Homeric Hymn III to Delian Apollo, Hera detained Eileithyia to prevent Leto from going into labor with Artemis and Apollo, since the father was Zeus. The other goddesses present at the birthing on Delos sent Iris to bring her. As she stepped upon the island, the divine birth began. In the myth of the birth of Heracles, it is Hera herself who sits at the door, delaying the birth of Heracles until her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Eurystheus, had been born first. The Homeric Hymn to Pythian Apollo makes the monster Typhaon the offspring of archaic Hera in her Minoan form, produced out of herself, like a monstrous version of Hephaestus, and whelped in a cave in Cilicia. She gave the creature to Python to raise. In the Temple of Hera, Olympia, Hera's seated cult figure was older than the warrior figure of Zeus that accompanied it.

Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, with Criminal Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced. Later, CBS approached CSI: NY writer Peter M. Lenkov to pitch a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov himself was a fan of the original. When executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman known about the remake, the two were originally hesitant to participate, but were impressed by Lenkov's pitch, since the story had \"such a great kind of paradigm for the show and how to really get into the characters that he really talked us into it.\" All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film. The producers discussed changing Kono to a female character. Lenkov noted that the producers did not have reservations as he initially though, but instead embraced the idea, as it would empower women in the remake by including them as main characters and not just victims or other minor characters. The pilot episode of the original series already established the Five-O task force, and when writing the pilot Lenkov wanted to give a proper introduction to the characters so that the audience can get to know them. Another difference in both the original and reimagined shows was the genre; the original was more police procedural, whereas the remake would be more action orientated, as well as some comedy mixed in, particularly from the banter between McGarrett and Danny. In the original script, there was no fighting between the two main characters, but the producers felt this would launch their partnership. Lenkov also included the return of an iconic catch phrase from the original series, \"Book 'em, Danno\". A table read-through of the pilot took place on February 19, 2010.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He had worked with several of the cast members earlier; Joel McHale, John Oliver and Chevy Chase all had cameo roles in episode 9 of Water and Power, the short film series produced by Harmon for Channel 101. Actor Chevy Chase had long been a favorite of Harmon. Though principally not very partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded to take the job by the quality of the show's writing. Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: \"What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop.\" Harmon had to warn Chase against playing a \"wise-ass\" the way he often does in his roles, since the character of Pierce is a rather pathetic figure who is normally the butt of the joke himself.

When Zero-X suffers a malfunction during re-entry, it is up to life-saving organisation International Rescue, supported by its technologically-advanced Thunderbird machines, to activate the trapped crew's escape pod before the spacecraft hits the ground. Filmed between March and June 1966 at Century 21's studios on the Slough Trading Estate and on location in Portugal, Thunderbirds Are Go features guest appearances by puppet versions of Cliff Richard and The Shadows, who also contributed to the film's score. It was the first film to be shot using an early form of video assist called \"Add-a-Vision\". The film's special effects sequences, directed by Derek Meddings, took six months to complete. Although early reviews praised the film as a successful cinematic transfer of the TV series, Thunderbirds Are Go drew a lukewarm public response and proved to be a box office failure. Later reviews would criticise the film for its minimal characterisation, lengthy effects shots, and inclusion of a fantasy dream sequence centring on Richard and The Shadows.

Eisner declined but recommended Harlan Ellison, who wrote a two-hour live-action script for the filmmaker. Friedkin and Ellison afterward had an unrelated argument, and the project was abandoned. During the 1980s, Brad Bird, Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz attempted to get an animated adaptation off the ground, though studio executives praised the screenplay, they thought the film would be unmarketable, and this version was scrapped. In the early 1990s, producer Michael Uslan and executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Steven Maier subsequently obtained the rights for a live-action film adaptation. The producer promised Eisner that he would not permit anyone who \"didn't get it\" to work on the project. Two ideas pitched to Uslan were to put the Spirit in a costume and to have the Spirit be a resurrected dead man who possessed supernatural powers. Screenwriter John Turman, a comic book fan, expressed interest in writing the script. In July 2004, financier OddLot Entertainment acquired the rights to the film. OddLot's producers Gigi Pritzker and Deborah Del Prete began a collaboration with Uslan, Melniker, and Maier working at Batfilm Productions, to adapt the story. Eisner, who was protective of the rights to his creations, said that he believed in the producers to faithfully adapt The Spirit. In April 2005, comic-book writer Jeph Loeb was hired to adapt The Spirit for the big screen, but the writer eventually left the project. Later in April, Uslan approached Frank Miller at Will Eisner's memorial service in New York City several weeks after Miller's Sin City was released in theaters, interested in initiating the adaptation technique with Miller's film for The Spirit.  Miller had initially hesitated, doubting his skill in adapting The Spirit, but ultimately embraced his first solo project as writer-director. Miller described his decision-making: In July 2006, the film trade press reported Miller would write and direct the film adaptation for The Spirit\u2009; Miller and the producers publicly announced this at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Miller said that he was putting together a film treatment that included large parts of The Spirit strip panels. As Miller described the project, \"I intend to be extremely faithful to the heart and soul of the material, but it won't be nostalgic. It will be much scarier than people expect\". Miller filmed The Spirit using the same digital background technology that was used for Sin City and 300. The film would also copy specific shots from the comic, similar to Sin City. In February 2007, Miller completed the first draft of the screenplay and began work on a second draft.  Principal photography was initially slated to begin in late spring 2007.  Miller also planned to begin filming Sin City 2 in spring 2009, and Uslan indicated that filming for The Spirit would begin before Miller started Sin City 2.

He sold his rights to United Artists, which had released it, and it made back its money. Critical response was mixed, from the New York Herald Tribune'''s four-star \"a magnificent job... Visually and dramatically, The Alamo is top-flight\" to Time magazine's \"flat as Texas\". At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 52% from 21 reviews. The film is thought to have been denied awards because Academy voters were alienated by an overblown publicity campaign, particularly one Variety ad claiming that the film's cast was praying harder for Chill Wills to win his award than the defenders of the Alamo prayed for their lives before the battle. The ad, placed by Wills, reportedly angered Wayne, who took out an ad of his own deploring Wills's tastelessness. In response to Wills's ad, claiming that all the voters were his \"Alamo Cousins\", Groucho Marx took out a small ad which simply said \"Dear Mr. Wills, I am delighted to be your cousin, but I voted for Sal Mineo\" . Wayne provided a clip of the film for use in How the West Was Won. Despite being anachronistic , the clip occurs near the beginning of the second half of the film, as Spencer Tracy narrates the events that led up to the American Civil War. Awards and honorsThe Alamo was nominated for seven Academy Awards . Its successful bid for several Oscar nominations over such films as Psycho and Spartacus was largely due to intense lobbying by producer John Wayne. Chill Wills' aggressive campaign for the Best Supporting Actor award was considered tasteless by many, including Wayne, who publicly apologized for Wills. Wills took out an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter claiming that \"We of the Alamo cast are praying harder - than the real Texans prayed for their lives in the Alamo - for Chill Wills to win the Oscar\". Wayne took out his own advertisement calling the claim \"untrue and reprehensible\" and that he was sure that Wills' \"intentions were not as bad as his taste\". Wills' publicity agent, W.S. \"Bow-Wow\" Wojciechowicz, accepted blame for the ill-advised effort, claiming that Wills had known nothing about it. Alternate versionsThe Alamo premiered at its 70\u00a0mm roadshow length of 202 minutes, including overture, intermission, and exit music, but was cut severely for wide release. UA re-edited it to 167 minutes. The 202-minute version was believed lost until Bob Bryden, a Canadian fan, realized he had seen the full version in the 1970s. He and Alamo collector Ashley Ward discovered the last known surviving print of the 70\u00a0mm premiere version in Toronto, in pristine condition. MGM used this print to make a digital video transfer of the roadshow version for VHS and LaserDisc release. The print was taken apart and deteriorated in storage. By 2007, it was unavailable in any useful form. MGM used the shorter, general release version for subsequent DVD releases. At present, the only existing version of the original uncut roadshow release is on standard definition 480i digital video. It is the source for broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies. The best available actual film elements are of the 35\u00a0mm negatives of the general release version. A restoration of the deteriorating print found in Toronto, supervised by Robert A. Harris, was envisaged but to date is not underway. The endangered version is the 70\u00a0mm uncut roadshow version . The cut 167-minute version still exists in decent condition in 35\u00a0mm. In 2014, an Internet campaign was formed urging MGM to restore The Alamo from the deteriorating 70mm elements. This garnered some publicity from KENS-TV in San Antonio, and attention from filmmakers such as J. J. Abrams, Matt Reeves, Rian Johnson, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.

As the band tried to lean towards a more hard rock sound, they felt that Johns was overemphasizing their country-influenced rock sound. Johns however felt that the Eagles were not capable of what the band wanted and told the band: \"You are not a rock-and-roll band, The Who is a rock-and-roll band, and you're not that.\"  The band\u2014Glenn Frey in particular, but not Don Henley\u2014were also unhappy with the no-drug policy of Johns during the recording; furthermore they did not feel at home recording in London. The band was concerned about the lack of success of the previous album Desperado, and were more assertive in wanting more input into the album, which Johns was unwilling to allow. The Eagles spent six weeks recording in London, with both the band and the producer becoming frustrated with each other and frequent arguments between Johns and Frey. The band then took a break, decided to find a new producer and discarded all the recordings except for two usable tracks, \"Best of My Love\" and \"You Never Cry Like a Lover\". The band relocated back to California and hired Bill Szymczyk, who had produced The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get by Joe Walsh\u2014who was also managed by their manager Irving Azoff and who would go on to join the Eagles in late 1975\u2014that interested the band. The band recorded the rest of the album at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. They were allowed more input in how the album was made and enjoyed more freedom with Szymczyk in the making of the album. Szymczyk suggested they bring in a harder-edged guitarist to add slide guitar to the song \"Good Day in Hell\". Bernie Leadon suggested his old friend Don Felder, whom they had met and jammed with on a few occasions. The band was so impressed that they invited Felder to become the fifth Eagle. The only other track on this album on which he appeared was \"Already Gone\". They credited him as a late arrival on the album's liner notes. On the difference in sound between Johns' and Szymczyk's productions, Henley said: \"There\u2019s a lot less echo with Bill, for one thing. There\u2019s more of a raw and funky presence. Glyn had a stamp he put on his records which is a deep echo that is really smooth like ice cream\". He thought that the production on the two songs that Johns produced was good and necessary. Frey, however, found that L.A. country-rock records were \"all too smooth and glassy\", and wanted a \"tougher sound\". Their friend and collaborator J. D. Souther ascribed the change of producer to \"Eagles\u2019 desire to get more of a live, thin sound on the albums\". The first two singles released were more rock-oriented; Frey was reluctant to release the Johns-produced \"Best of My Love\" as a single, and held off its release for some months. However, when it was finally released, the label had truncated the song\u2013without the band's knowledge or approval\u2013so that it would be more radio-friendly. \"Best of My Love\" would become their biggest hit thus far, and their first No. 1 on the charts.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_1273", "question": "Who was the producer of Creature?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_12594", "text": "Development of the film began in the mid-1970s when producers David Foster and Lawrence Turman suggested to Universal Pictures an adaptation of the 1938 John W. Campbell novella Who Goes There?. It had been loosely adapted once before in Howard Hawks's and Christian Nyby's 1951 film The Thing from Another World, but Foster and Turman wanted to develop a project that stuck more closely to the source material. Screenwriters Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins held the rights to make an adaptation, but passed on the opportunity to make a new film, so Universal obtained the rights from them. In 1976, Wilbur Stark had purchased the remake rights to 23 RKO Pictures films, including The Thing from Another World, from three Wall Street financiers who did not know what to do with them, in exchange for a return when the films were produced. Universal in turn acquired the rights to remake the film from Stark, resulting in him being given an executive producer credit on all print advertisements, posters, television commercials, and studio press material. John Carpenter was first approached about the project in 1976 by co-producer and friend Stuart Cohen, but Carpenter was mainly an independent film director, so Universal chose The Texas Chain Saw Massacre director Tobe Hooper as they already had him under contract. The producers were ultimately unhappy with Hooper and his writing partner Kim Henkel's concept. After several more failed pitches by different writers, and attempts to bring on other directors, such as John Landis, the project was put on hold. Even so, the success of Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction horror film Alien helped revitalize the project, at which point Carpenter became loosely attached following his success with his influential slasher film Halloween . Carpenter was reluctant to join the project, for he thought Hawks's adaptation would be difficult to surpass, although he considered the film's monster to be unnotable. Cohen suggested that he read the original novella. Carpenter found the \"creepiness\" of the imitations conducted by the creature, and the questions it raised, interesting. He drew parallels between the novella and Agatha Christie's mystery novel And Then There Were None , and noted that the story of Who Goes There? was \"timely\" for him, meaning he could make it \"true to [his] day\" as Hawks had in his time. Carpenter, a fan of Hawks's adaptation, paid homage to it in Halloween, and he watched The Thing from Another World several times for inspiration before filming began. Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey first worked together on Halloween, and The Thing was their first big-budget project for a major film studio. After securing the writer and crew, the film was stalled again when Carpenter nearly quit, believing that a passion project of his, El Diablo , was on the verge of being made by EMI Films. The producers discussed various replacements including Walter Hill, Sam Peckinpah and Michael Ritchie, but the development of El Diablo was not as imminent as Carpenter believed, and he remained with The Thing. Universal initially set a budget of $10million, with $200,000 for \"creature effects\", which at the time was more than the studio had ever allocated to a monster film. Filming was scheduled to be completed within 98 days. Universal's production studios estimated that it would require at least $17million before marketing and other costs, as the plan involved more set construction, including external sets and a large set piece for the original scripted death of Bennings, which was estimated to cost $1.5million alone. As storyboarding and designs were finalized, the crew estimated they would need at least $750,000 for creature effects, a figure Universal executives agreed to after seeing the number of workers employed under Rob Bottin, the special make-up effects designer. Associate producer Larry Franco was responsible for making the budget work for the film; he cut the filming schedule by a third, eliminated the exterior sets for on-site shooting, and removed Bennings's more extravagant death scene. Cohen suggested reusing the destroyed American camp as the ruined Norwegian camp, saving a further $250,000. When filming began in August, The Thing had a budget of $11.4million, and indirect costs brought it to $14million. The effects budget ran over, eventually totaling $1.5million, forcing the elimination of some scenes, including Nauls's confrontation of a creature dubbed the \"box Thing\". By the end of production, Carpenter had to make a personal appeal to executive Ned Tanen for $100,000 to complete a simplified version of the Blair-Thing. The final cost was $12.4million, and overhead costs brought it to $15million.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They are now available on DVD. The series began in 1991 with Summoned by Shadows, co-produced with the BBC Film Club as a knowing homage to the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who and in a pragmatic attempt to take advantage of the consequent pre-existing audience. Summoned by Shadows is a Who-style tale of strange doings in an unspecified time period on Earth featuring three actors known for their roles in Doctor Who and playing similar characters. The unnamed protagonist is played by Colin Baker, his assistant Miss Brown by Nicola Bryant, who had played the Doctor's assistant Peri Brown opposite Colin Baker for two years, and the villain of the piece by Michael Wisher, who had been the first actor to play Davros. The second story, More than a Messiah, adapted the Doctor Who Audio Visuals story of the same name, but with the Stranger and Miss Brown substituted for the Doctor and companion Ria .

Originally, he was attached to direct Pinkville, a film about the Army's investigation of the My Lai Massacre, but development was canceled due to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike and actor Bruce Willis pulling out of the film three weeks before shooting was set to start. As a result, United Artists shut the production down. Stone moved on to direct a film about the life of George W. Bush, shopping a script that had been written before the strike by Stanley Weiser, who had co-written Wall Street with Stone. Weiser and Stone read 17 books as part of their research for the script, and worked on the project for a year before venturing to film Pinkville. Stone has admitted that he and Weiser had to speculate on some dialogue: \"You take all the facts and take the spirit of the scene and make it accurate to what you think happened\". W. was financed independently for Stone, with Hong Kong, German, and Australian funds: he tried to approach American studios for money, but got turned down. Lions Gate Entertainment distributed the film. Though Stone has criticized Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the director said that he was not looking to make an \"anti-Bush polemic.\" Stone compared his goal of the film to that of The Queen, wanting to trace \"seminal events in Bush's life.\" According to the director, \"It's a behind-the-scenes approach, similar to Nixon, to give a sense of what it's like to be in his skin. But if Nixon was a symphony, this is more like a chamber piece, and not as dark in tone.\" He described the structure of W. as a three-act film starting with Bush as a young man \"with a missed life\", followed by his transformation and \"an assertion of will which was amazingly powerful\" as he came out from his father's shadow, and finally his invasion of Iraq. The film, originally titled Bush, was re-titled W.  Filming began on May 12, 2008, in Shreveport, Louisiana, and completed filming on July 11, 2008. On May 13, 2008, the New York Post published excerpts from an early draft of the script. The column, written by Cindy Adams, stated \"Pro-Bushies will hate it, antis will love it.\" The film was released on October 17, 2008, timed just before that year's presidential election. W.

It is the first feature film directed by Anton Corbijn, who had worked with Joy Division as a photographer. The screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh was based on the biography Touching from a Distance by Curtis's widow Deborah, who served as a co-producer on the film. Tony Wilson, who released Joy Division's records through his Factory Records label, also served as a co-producer. Curtis' bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via their post-Joy Division incarnation New Order. Control was filmed partly on location in Nottingham, Manchester, and Macclesfield, including areas where Curtis lived, and was shot in colour and then printed to black-and-white. Its title comes from the Joy Division song \"She's Lost Control\", and that much of the plot deals with the notion that Curtis tried to remain in control of his own life, and yet had no control over his epilepsy and pharmaceutical side effects. Sam Riley and Samantha Morton star as Ian and Deborah Curtis, and the film portrays the events of the couple's lives from 1973 to 1980, focusing on their marriage, the formation and career of Joy Division, Ian's struggle with epilepsy, and his extramarital affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honor\u00e9, culminating in his May 1980 suicide. Alexandra Maria Lara plays Honor\u00e9, while James Anthony Pearson, Joe Anderson, and Harry Treadaway play Sumner, Hook, and Morris, respectively. The film also features Toby Kebbell as band manager Rob Gretton and Craig Parkinson as Tony Wilson. Control premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2007 where it won several awards including the Director's Fortnight, the CICAE Art & Essai prize for best film, the Regards Jeunes Prize for best first/second directed feature film, and the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film in the sidebar. It went on to win five British Independent Film Awards including Best Film, Best Director for Corbijn, Most Promising Newcomer for Riley, and Best Supporting Actor for Kebbell.

Brad Johnson, Senior Vice President of comedy development, said The Simple Life was born out of a challenge from Fox Television Entertainment Group Chairman, Sandy Grushow, and News Corp.

In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who\u00a0\u2013 The Ultimate Adventure. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor. A pilot episode for a potential spinoff series, K-9 and Company, was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series. Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced. Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled Torchwood , set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, Dreamland, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official Doctor Who website in 2009. Class, featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness. Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show's first episode. The series was picked up by BBC America on 8 January 2016 and by BBC One a day later. On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled. Numerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series Faction Paradox, Iris Wildthyme and Bernice Summerfield; as well as the made-for-video series P.R.O.B.E.; the Australian-produced television series K-9, which aired a 26-episode first season on Disney XD; and the audio spin-off Counter-Measures.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "164_1295", "question": "Who was the producer of The Eighth Day?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_83035", "text": "The predominant element of the piece is that of a bass guitar played through a delay unit, set to produce repeats in quarter-note triplets. The result of this setting is: if the player plays simple quarter notes, the added echoes will produce a pattern of quarter note \u2013 eighth note, quarter note \u2013 eighth note. Pink Floyd would again use this technique on the bass line for \"Sheep\". This riff was first created by David Gilmour on guitar with effects, then Roger Waters had the idea of using bass instead of guitar, so they recorded the song on two different bass guitars. The piece is in B minor, occasionally alternating with an A major chord. The distinctive keyboard accents on this track are composed of three components: A Hammond organ forms the 'fade in', followed by a \"Stab\" composed of a second Hammond organ with percussion stop, overdubbed with an acoustic piano fed through a Leslie speaker, as was also used on \"Echoes\". For live versions, the 'fade in' part was played on a Farfisa organ. The threatening lyric, a rare vocal contribution by Nick Mason, was recorded through a ring modulator and slowed down to create an eerie effect. It was aimed at Sir Jimmy Young, the then BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 DJ who the band supposedly disliked because of his tendency to babble. During early 1970s concerts, they sometimes played a sound collage of clips from Young's radio show that was edited to sound completely nonsensical, thus figuratively \"cutting him into little pieces\". The bootleg compilation A Treeful of Secrets contains a demo version of \"One of These Days\" in which the Jimmy Young collage loops in the background during the performance. However, the authenticity of this demo has not been confirmed. According to John Peel, Waters described \"One of These Days\" as a \"poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation\". Gilmour said it was the most collaborative piece ever produced by the group. A film, French Windows, was made by Ian Emes, set to the piece and featuring people and gibbons dancing against various backgrounds. After being seen on television by the band, it was back-projected by Pink Floyd during live performances and Emes was commissioned to make further films for the band. The tune also quotes Delia Derbyshire's realisation of Ron Grainer's Doctor Who theme music from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. This quotation is most clear in live performances, particularly in concerts on the Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell tours. Part of the song was used on the Soviet television program \"Mezhdunarodnaya Panorama\" . The playing of the track in the program is also discussed in Victor Pelevin's novel Omon Ra. A similar bass riff is used during the first seconds of Brian Eno's song \"Third Uncle\" on the album  Taking Tiger Mountain .", "hasanswer": false}]}

Buildings used were the Electricity Board building for the Alpha 60 computer centre and the Hotel Scribe. Constantine came to the film through producer Andr\u00e9 Michelin, who had the actor under contract. Constantine had become a popular actor in France and Germany through his portrayal of tough-guy detective Lemmy Caution in a series of earlier films. Godard appropriated the character for Alphaville but according to director Anne Andreu, Godard's subversion of the Lemmy Caution \"stereotype\" effectively shattered Constantine's connection with the character\u2014he reportedly said that he was shunned by producers after Alphaville was released. Constantine didn't play Lemmy Caution again until Panic Time in 1980. The opening section of the film includes an unedited sequence that depicts Caution walking into his hotel, checking in, riding an elevator and being taken through various corridors to his room. According to cinematographer Raoul Coutard, he and Godard shot this section as a continuous four-minute take. Part of this sequence shows Caution riding an elevator up to his room, which was achieved thanks to the fact that the hotel used as the location had two glass-walled elevators side by side, allowing the camera operator to ride in one lift while filming Constantine riding the other car through the glass between the two. However, as Coutard recalled, this required multiple takes, since the elevators were old and in practice they proved very difficult to synchronize. Like most of Godard's films, the performances and dialogue in Alphaville were substantially improvised. Assistant director Charles Bitsch recalled that, even when production commenced he had no idea what Godard was planning to do. Godard's first act was to ask Bitsch to write a screenplay, saying that producer Michelin had been pestering him for a script because he needed it to help him raise finance from backers in Germany . Bitsch protested that he had never read a Lemmy Caution book, but Godard simply said \"Read one and then write it.\" Bitsch read a Caution book, then wrote a 30-page treatment and brought it to Godard, who said \"OK, fine\" and took it without even looking at it. It was then given to Michelin, who was pleased with the result, and the \"script\" was duly translated into German and sent off to the backers. In fact, none of it even reached the screen and according to Bitsch the German backers later asked Michelin to repay the money when they saw the completed film.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_1307", "question": "Who was the producer of The Sessions?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_35634", "text": "Who Are You was recorded when punk rock was popular. This is not reflected in the album's music, which incorporates elements of progressive rock and, according to biographer Tony Fletcher, it was produced in such a way as to appeal to commercial rock radio at the time. The album showcased some of Townshend's most complicated arrangements, with multiple layers of synthesizer and strings. Many of the songs also revisited themes from Townshend's long-contemplated Lifehouse project, featuring lyrics about songwriting and music as a metaphor for life, as indicated by titles like \"Guitar and Pen\", \"New Song\", \"Music Must Change\", and \"Sister Disco\". The latter two, along with \"Who Are You\", ultimately appeared on Lifehouse Chronicles, Townshend's later actualization of the project. Several of the song's lyrics also reflect Townshend's uncertainty about the Who's continued relevance in the wake of punk rock, and his dissatisfaction with the music industry. There was a three-year hiatus between Who Are You and the Who's previous album, The Who by Numbers. The band was drifting apart during this period, as band members were working on various solo projects, and Moon was driving deeper into drug and alcohol abuse. The initial sessions at Ramport Studios, produced by Glyn Johns and Jon Astley, were lackadaisical; Jon Astley recalled that \"no one wanted to work\", and the members looked forward more to drinking and reminiscing at six in the evening. Astley felt that he and Johns pushed Moon too hard to play a simpler style, while Johns believed that Moon had \"lost confidence in his ability\" and would deliberately go out of his way to resist his suggestions. Moon's health was especially an object of concern, as his drumming skills had noticeably deteriorated and his performances for most of the sessions were substandard. He was unable to play in 6/8 time on the track \"Music Must Change\", so the drums were removed completely from the track, and replaced with the sound of footsteps and a few cymbal crashes. Bassist John Entwistle remarked that Moon \"couldn't think of anything to play.\" On another occasion, Astley recalled, \"I was doing a drum track, and he hadn't learned the song. I actually had to stand up and conduct. He said, 'Can you give me a cue when you get to the middle part?' [...] He hadn't done his homework.\" Entwistle similarly described Moon as \"really out of condition\", and \"disgusted with himself\" as a result. The recording was further delayed when lead singer Roger Daltrey underwent throat surgery, and when during a lengthy Christmas break, Townshend sliced his hand in a window during an argument with his parents. Former Zombies and Argent member Rod Argent was also called in to replace session keyboardist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick after Bundrick suffered a broken arm falling out of a taxi at the studio door. When the sessions resumed in March, they were moved to RAK Studios, which caused further delays due to the equipment malfunctioning, including the wiping of a backing track. Astley stated that the RAK equipment made the existing material sound different when played back, necessitating further delays as he attempted to fix the audio problems. In one incident, Daltrey punched Johns in the face due to an argument over a rough mix, rendering him unconscious. The argument was fueled by Ted Astley adding a string arrangement to \"Had Enough\", which Daltrey derided as \"slushy\". After one long and frustrating day, Townshend planned to fire Moon from the band unless he cleaned up his act. The plan drove Moon to attempt to kick his alcohol habit and work more enthusiastically. Due to a prior commitment to produce the Joan Armatrading album To the Limit, Johns had to leave in April, with Astley remaining as sole producer. Under Astley's command, the sessions returned to Ramport, with all of the drums except for \"Who Are You\" recorded in the last two weeks of production. Who Are You was released on 18 August 1978. Moon died on 7 September 1978, just under a month after the album's release; on the cover, he is shown sitting in a chair labelled \"Not to be taken away\". Photographer Terry O'Neil had insisted Moon sit with the back of the chair facing the camera so as to hide his distended stomach, a result of his alcoholism.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, Karaszewski figured, \"there would be no one on the planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren't the sort of movies that are made.\" Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films for their work on Problem Child and Problem Child 2, Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page film treatment for Ed Wood and pitched the idea to Heathers director Michael Lehmann, with whom they attended USC film school. The basis for their treatment came from Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy, a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues. Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on Heathers, Denise Di Novi. Di Novi had previously worked with Tim Burton on Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing. Burton began reading Nightmare of Ecstasy and some of Wood's letters. He was taken by how he \"wrote about his films as if he was making Citizen Kane, you know, whereas other people perceived them as, like, the worst movies ever\". Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with an aggrandizing bias born of his admiration for Wood's work, rather than the derisive attitude of Wood's detractors. The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton's relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, Vincent Price. He said in an interview, \"Meeting Vincent had an incredible impact on me, the same impact Ed must have felt meeting and working with his idol.\" Meanwhile, Burton had been asked to direct Mary Reilly for Columbia Pictures with Winona Ryder in the title role. However, Burton dropped out of Mary Reilly over Columbia's decision to fast track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts in the title role instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to become interested in directing Ed Wood himself, on the understanding that it could be done quickly. Lehmann said, \"Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to Airheads.\" Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. Ed Wood gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, \"On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous.\" Initially, Ed Wood was in development with Columbia, but when Burton decided he wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, studio head Mark Canton would not agree to it unless Columbia was given a first-look deal. Burton said black-and-white was \"right for the material and the movie, and this was a movie that had to be in black-and-white\". He insisted on total creative control, and so in April 1993, a month before the original start date, Canton put Ed Wood into turnaround. The decision sparked interest from Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox in optioning the film rights, but Burton accepted an offer from Walt Disney Studios, who had previously produced The Nightmare Before Christmas. Similar to Nightmare, Disney released Ed Wood under their Touchstone Pictures banner. With a budget of $18 million, Disney did not feel the film was that much of a risk, and granted Burton total creative autonomy. Burton also refused a salary, and was not paid for his work on Ed Wood. Principal photography began in August 1993, and lasted 72 days. Despite his previous six-film relationship with Danny Elfman, Burton chose Howard Shore to write the film score. Under the pressure of finishing the score for Batman Returns, Burton's relationship with Elfman became strained and Burton admitted he and Elfman experienced \"creative differences\" during The Nightmare Before Christmas. The movie was filmed at various locations in and around the Los Angeles area.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Music remained an important element in establishing the atmosphere of Halloween III. Just as in Halloween and Halloween II, there was no symphonic score. Much of the music was composed to solicit \"false startles\" from the audience. The score of Halloween III differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and sequel. Carpenter replaced the familiar 10/8 piano melody with an electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping tonalities. Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film: The music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music. This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has \"instant gratification\", allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the picture. This is quite an invaluable asset. One of the more memorable aspects of the film's soundtrack was the jingle from the Silver Shamrock Halloween mask commercial. Set to the tune of \"London Bridge Is Falling Down\", the commercial in the film counts down the number of days until Halloween beginning with day eight followed by an announcer's voice encouraging children to purchase a Silver Shamrock mask to wear on Halloween night: ReceptionHalloween III: Season of the Witch received generally negative reviews. The New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby struggled to apply a definite label to the film's content. He remarks, \"Halloween III manages the not easy feat of being anti-children, anti-capitalism, anti-television and anti-Irish all at the same time.\" On the other hand, he says that the film \"is probably as good as any cheerful ghoul could ask for.\" Other critics were far more decisive in their assessments. Roger Ebert wrote that the film was \"a low-rent thriller from the first frame. This is one of those Identikit movies, assembled out of familiar parts from other, better movies.\" However, he did praise Stacey Nelkin's performance. Cinefantastique magazine called the film a \"hopelessly jumbled mess\". Jason Paul Collum points to the absence of Michael Myers and the film's nihilistic ending as reasons why the film dissatisfied reviewers and audiences alike. Tom Milne of Time Out offered a more positive review, calling the title \"a bit of a cheat, since the indestructible psycho of the first two films plays no part here.\" Unlike other critics, Milne thought the new plot was refreshing: \"With the possibilities of the characters [of the previous Halloween films] well and truly exhausted, Season of the Witch turns more profitably to a marvellously ingenious Nigel Kneale tale of a toymaker and his fiendish plan to restore Halloween to its witch cult origins.\" Although Milne was unhappy that Kneale's original script was reduced to \"a bit of a mess\", he still believed the end result was \"hugely enjoyable\".

The site's consensus reads, \"Its laudable deviation from series formula not withstanding, Halloween III: Season Of The Witch offers paltry thrills and dubious plotting.\"PopMatters journalist J. C. Ma\u00e7ek III wrote that the film \"features no serial killers or slashers of any kind ... Still, this could have been somewhat interesting, or at least not condemnable, had the film been any good. It's not. Almost every time it starts to get to the point where we might actually become engrossed in the film, director Tommy Lee Wallace throws in something corny like ... oh, like a human decapitation scene that shows just how much the producers invested in latex. Seriously, could the special effects look a little more fake, please? I was just getting to the point where I could almost tell the robots from the real people ... making a real person look faker than Michael Jackson's nose blissfully confuses me all over again.\" Academics find the film full of critiques of late 20th-century American society; historian Nicholas Rogers points to an anti-corporate message where an otherwise successful businessman turns \"oddly irrational\" and seeks to \"promote a more robotic future for commerce and manufacture.\" Cochran's \"astrological obsessions or psychotic hatred of children overrode his business sense.\" Tony Williams argues that the film's plot signified the results of the \"victory of patriarchal corporate control.\" In a similar vein, Martin Harris writes that Halloween III contains \"an ongoing, cynical commentary on American consumer culture.\" Upset over the commercialization of the Halloween holiday, Cochran uses \"the very medium he abhors as a weapon against itself.\" Harris also discusses other big business critiques in the film, including the unemployment of local workers and the declining quality of mass-produced products. Box officeHalloween III: Season of the Witch opened in 1,297 theaters in the United States on October 22, 1982, and earned $6,333,259 in its opening weekend. Like its predecessor, the film was distributed through Universal by Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis. It grossed a total of $14,400,000 in the United States, but was the worst performing Halloween film at the time. Several other horror films that premiered in 1982 performed far better, including Poltergeist , Friday the 13th Part III , and Creepshow .", "hasanswer": false}]}

This is not reflected in the album's music, which incorporates elements of progressive rock and, according to biographer Tony Fletcher, it was produced in such a way as to appeal to commercial rock radio at the time. The album showcased some of Townshend's most complicated arrangements, with multiple layers of synthesizer and strings. Many of the songs also revisited themes from Townshend's long-contemplated Lifehouse project, featuring lyrics about songwriting and music as a metaphor for life, as indicated by titles like \"Guitar and Pen\", \"New Song\", \"Music Must Change\", and \"Sister Disco\". The latter two, along with \"Who Are You\", ultimately appeared on Lifehouse Chronicles, Townshend's later actualization of the project. Several of the song's lyrics also reflect Townshend's uncertainty about the Who's continued relevance in the wake of punk rock, and his dissatisfaction with the music industry. There was a three-year hiatus between Who Are You and the Who's previous album, The Who by Numbers. The band was drifting apart during this period, as band members were working on various solo projects, and Moon was driving deeper into drug and alcohol abuse. The initial sessions at Ramport Studios, produced by Glyn Johns and Jon Astley, were lackadaisical; Jon Astley recalled that \"no one wanted to work\", and the members looked forward more to drinking and reminiscing at six in the evening. Astley felt that he and Johns pushed Moon too hard to play a simpler style, while Johns believed that Moon had \"lost confidence in his ability\" and would deliberately go out of his way to resist his suggestions. Moon's health was especially an object of concern, as his drumming skills had noticeably deteriorated and his performances for most of the sessions were substandard. He was unable to play in 6/8 time on the track \"Music Must Change\", so the drums were removed completely from the track, and replaced with the sound of footsteps and a few cymbal crashes. Bassist John Entwistle remarked that Moon \"couldn't think of anything to play.\" On another occasion, Astley recalled, \"I was doing a drum track, and he hadn't learned the song. I actually had to stand up and conduct. He said, 'Can you give me a cue when you get to the middle part?' [...] He hadn't done his homework.\" Entwistle similarly described Moon as \"really out of condition\", and \"disgusted with himself\" as a result. The recording was further delayed when lead singer Roger Daltrey underwent throat surgery, and when during a lengthy Christmas break, Townshend sliced his hand in a window during an argument with his parents. Former Zombies and Argent member Rod Argent was also called in to replace session keyboardist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick after Bundrick suffered a broken arm falling out of a taxi at the studio door. When the sessions resumed in March, they were moved to RAK Studios, which caused further delays due to the equipment malfunctioning, including the wiping of a backing track. Astley stated that the RAK equipment made the existing material sound different when played back, necessitating further delays as he attempted to fix the audio problems. In one incident, Daltrey punched Johns in the face due to an argument over a rough mix, rendering him unconscious. The argument was fueled by Ted Astley adding a string arrangement to \"Had Enough\", which Daltrey derided as \"slushy\". After one long and frustrating day, Townshend planned to fire Moon from the band unless he cleaned up his act. The plan drove Moon to attempt to kick his alcohol habit and work more enthusiastically. Due to a prior commitment to produce the Joan Armatrading album To the Limit, Johns had to leave in April, with Astley remaining as sole producer. Under Astley's command, the sessions returned to Ramport, with all of the drums except for \"Who Are You\" recorded in the last two weeks of production. Who Are You was released on 18 August 1978. Moon died on 7 September 1978, just under a month after the album's release; on the cover, he is shown sitting in a chair labelled \"Not to be taken away\". Photographer Terry O'Neil had insisted Moon sit with the back of the chair facing the camera so as to hide his distended stomach, a result of his alcoholism.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Brad Johnson, Senior Vice President of comedy development, said The Simple Life was born out of a challenge from Fox Television Entertainment Group Chairman, Sandy Grushow, and News Corp.

The Simple Life was inspired by Green Acres, a sitcom about a New York society couple who moved to a farm. Johnson said they originally thought of moving an entire family to the South. Cameras would observe as the former socialites, deprived of access to their bank accounts and Beemers, attempt to get a job, buy groceries, and fit in with average Americans. At the same time the comedy department was developing the idea, Paris Hilton was meeting with the studio's casting department. Sharon Klein, senior VP of casting at the studio, said she was immediately fascinated by Hilton and wanted to do a show with her. \u201cI'm used to meeting with actors who are putting on a facade,\u201d Klein said. \u201cShe was so real. She was funny. At that first meeting she did not come off stupid. She was in her own reality and not embarrassed to talk about it. There was a sweetness to her.\u201d The two departments talked and realized they had their show: Send Paris Hilton and her sister Nicky, who had never worked a day in their lives, to live and work on a farm. At the time, the studio was working closely with Mike Darnell, head of reality programming at Fox, who liked the idea. \u201cThey wanted to see stilettos in cow shit,\u201d Klein said.

Henry's wife Martha, a Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she dislikes Alicia. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel , which would mean more money and respectability for shorter hours, but may also be too boring for his tastes. A hot story is circulating the city, involving the murder of two white businessmen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Two African-American teenagers are arrested for the crime, which both Henry and Sun columnist Michael McDougal believe to be false charges when they overhear the NYPD discuss the arrest on the Sun office's police scanner. Henry becomes obsessed with the case, getting others from the Sun staff to investigate along with him. He blows his job offer at the Sentinel after he steals information about the case from the editor's notes while being interviewed for the job, reporting it during a Sun staff meeting. Martha discovers through her friend in the Justice Department that the businessmen were bankers who stole a large sum of money from their largest investor, a trucking company with ties to the Mafia. Henry begins to believe that it was a setup and the Brooklyn boys were likely just caught in the midst of it. Henry leaves a dinner with Martha and his parents to go to the police station with McDougal to confirm that the boys were not responsible before they print the story.

Ho had argued that to ensure success in his films, Chan should play to his fanbase by only doing action movies and avoiding the love scenes that may alienate certain markets . Ho died on 16 February 1998 and Chan left Golden Harvest soon after, seeking a change and a new freedom to make the films he really wanted to. This coincided with his growing fame in the West, due to the international success of the film Rush Hour. Gorgeous was originally conceived purely as a love story, with Chan as producer, but not as one of the film's cast. In order to secure the actress Shu Qi, the script of the film was re-written and a role for Chan was created. This soon developed into a starring role, and elements of action crept in. However, Gorgeous remains primarily a romantic comedy and so it differs from his usual all-out action films. The action scenes are fewer and there is no real bad guy character \u2013 the fight with the nominal enemy is a pre-arranged bout and both fighters wear boxing gloves \u2013 competitive rather than motivated by revenge or the fight for survival. The director had wanted to use Chan's office as the set for C.N.'s apartment, but this proved impractical, particularly as that section of the office is on the third floor. However, many props from Chan's office were used including his own training dummy. Chan said of his character C.N., that he was \"60-70% Jackie Chan\". The clothing the character wears, the training routine he undergoes and healthy lifestyle he maintains, his general good nature and his environmental role are all traits and actions of Chan himself. Chan summarised the difference between the films Rush Hour and Gorgeous, stating the former was a job, and the latter was his baby. In Rush Hour his role was restricted to actor and action director. In Gorgeous, he was also the producer, editor and was involved in casting. Although a romantic comedy, the only significant kissing scene was dropped from the main film for fear that it would alienate certain East Asian markets who may not want to see Chan in such a relationship. The underwater kiss scene was retained and appeared amongst the out-takes that accompany the film's closing credits.

When his driving prowess is questioned by Glasses and Teeth, he systematically wrecks the criminals' car while giving them a display of his skill; while Glasses and Teeth are screaming in the back seat for him to stop, Fingers enjoys the demonstration. The Driver then tells the gang that he will not work with them. Later, Teeth visits The Driver, first asking him again to join them, but then drawing his gun and threatening him. The Driver calmly challenges Teeth to shoot, but when he backs down, they fight and The Driver easily defeats him. Since the gang could not convince The Driver to work with them, The Detective confronts him at his rented room, taunting him and challenging him to a 'game' between them. Despite knowing that the job has been set up to catch him, The Driver agrees to take part on the condition that his fee is doubled, and that Teeth does not take part. During the heist, Glasses kills Fingers, who he does not trust, and successfully escapes with The Driver. However, Glasses does not bring him to The Detective: instead, he plans to kill The Driver and make off with the money, relying on his reputation for never carrying a gun. However, The Driver surprises him by being armed on this occasion, killing him and taking the money. The Driver stashes the money in a locker at Union Station. He meets with The Connection, who agrees to launder the dirty money. He then meets with The Player, enlisting her to help with retrieving the clean money. Meanwhile, Teeth, who has discovered Glasses dead, interrogates The Connection at gunpoint, killing her once she reveals The Driver's plans. The Player heads to the train station, meeting with the Exchange Man. He stashes the clean money in an empty locker, then boards a train with the dirty money. Unbeknownst to them, the station is being watched by the police. The Exchange Man is followed on board by The Detective, who kills him in a shootout. Meanwhile, Teeth confronts The Player, stealing her purse containing the key to the locker containing the clean money. Teeth and his new driver, The Kid, are chased by The Driver and The Player. The chase culminates in a warehouse, where The Driver drives directly at Teeth's car, causing The Kid to swerve out of the way and roll the car. The Driver tells Teeth to surrender, killing him when he refuses. The Kid returns the purse and is allowed to leave. The Driver returns to the train station with The Player and retrieves the bag from the locker. He is met by The Detective and numerous police officers waiting to arrest him, but reveals that the bag is empty, as he had been ripped off by the Exchange Man. Upon seeing the empty bag, The Player leaves. The Driver leaves The Detective literally 'holding the bag', and each man departs from the station.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn\u2019t operate in any comparable way\".

Peart said that the lyrics are related to a tendency that people have for idealizing the lifestyle of others. People tend to imagine that those who are rich and famous are to be viewed as people who have fewer personal issues than ordinary people. However, he argues that every life has its own level of \"toughness.\" As an example of this idea, he recounts that people used to refer to him as someone who has the best job in the world. He claims that he is very proud of being a musician, which was a job that he dreamed of in his youth. However, he claims people tend not to realize that being away from family for several months while on tour is not as easy as others make it sound.  A key verse to express that concept says \"We each pay a fabulous price for our visions of paradise,\" referring to personal sacrifices he had to make to achieve his dream. A Sputnikmusic review gave a description of \"Mission\" as a \"rocky ballad.\" It plays in a D major key, though key changes into Bmajor occur in certain parts of the song. Most of the song is played at a moderate tempo in a time signature of common time. However, the musical interlude between the second chorus and final verse is played in  time. The song features prominent keyboard parts played by Geddy Lee. When working on the song in Britain, producer Peter Collins added brass and choir instrumentation. The brass was performed by the William Faery brass band, and was recorded in Oldham, England. Collins also suggested that new verses be added to the song. A marimba solo is played in the song, in unison with the snare drum and bass. The marimba was a KAT mini-marimba sampled in the AKAI S-900 sampler.", "hasanswer": false}]}

To gain a more realistic performance, the show's producers have deceived Bolt his entire life, arranging the filming in such a way that Bolt believes everything in the show is real and that he really has superpowers including a devastatingly powerful sonic scream-like \"superbark\". After a cliffhanger episode causes Bolt to believe Penny has been kidnapped, he escapes from his on-set trailer in Hollywood, but knocks himself unconscious in the process and is trapped inside a box of foam peanuts being shipped to New York City. In New York, Bolt resumes his search for Penny. Much to his dismay and confusion, he finds out the hard way that his \"superpowers\" are useless.

Penny is genuinely distraught over Bolt\u2019s disappearance, but reluctantly agrees to halt the search so production can continue. Surprised at his first feelings of hunger, Bolt is shown by Mittens how to act like a cute but needy dog, obtaining food for them both at an RV park. They are joined by Rhino, a fearless hamster and huge Bolt fanatic. Rhino's unwavering faith in Bolt substantiates the dog's illusions about himself, but allows Mittens to figure out Bolt is from a television show. She tries to tell Bolt this, but Bolt simply becomes frustrated as everything he believed to be real starts to crumble around him. Attempting to \"superbark\" her repeatedly, the noise draws the attention of Animal Control and Bolt and Mittens are both captured and taken to an animal shelter.

They rescue Mittens from the shelter and as they continue west, Bolt and Mittens form a close friendship in which she teaches Bolt how to be an ordinary dog and enjoy typical dog activities. Mittens makes plans for the three of them to stay in Las Vegas, but Bolt is still drawn to find Penny. Mittens tells him that Penny is only an actor and humans never truly love their pets because eventually they will betray and abandon them as it happened to her. Bolt refuses to believe her and continues on alone to Hollywood, but Rhino encourages Mittens to stand by him as friends and they follow shortly after. Bolt reaches the studio and finds Penny embracing his look-alike, unaware that Penny still misses him and her affection for the lookalike is only a part of a rehearsal. A broken-hearted Bolt leaves, but Mittens sees Penny telling her mother how much she misses Bolt. Mittens follows Bolt and explains. At the same time, the Bolt look-alike panics during the show's filming and accidentally knocks over some flaming torches, setting the sound stage on fire with Penny trapped inside. Bolt arrives and the two reunite inside the burning studio, but are unable to escape before Penny begins to suffocate from the smoke. Penny begs Bolt to go, but Bolt refuses to leave her.

It boasts a cast of pure gold, and its \"recreation of the Old Globe, the fame that brought ruin and dishonour to both Oxford and the money-grubbing Shakespeare, and the sacrifice of Oxford's own property and family fortune to write plays he believed in against a background of danger and violence make for a bloody good yarn, masterfully told, lushly appointed, slavishly researched and brilliantly acted.\" He adds the caveats that it does play \"hopscotch with history\", has a bewildering and confusing cast of characters and is jumpy in its timeframes. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune writes that the film is ridiculous but not dull. Displaying a \"rollicking belief in its own nutty bombast\" as \"history is simultaneously being made up and rewritten\", its best scenes are those of the candle-lit interiors caught by the Alexa digital camera on a lovely copper-and-honey-toned palette. After a week, what remains in Phillips' memory is not the de Vere/Shakespeare conspiracy theory but \"the way Redgrave gazes out a window, her reign near the end, her eyes full of regret but also of fiery defiance of the balderdash lapping at her feet.\" Roger Ebert finds Orloff's screenplay \"ingenious\", Emmerich's direction \"precise\", and the cast \"memorable\". Though \"profoundly mistaken\", Anonymous is \"a marvellous historical film\", giving viewers \"a splendid experience: the dialogue, the acting, the depiction of London, the lust, jealousy and intrigue.\" However, Emmerich must \"tiresomely insist that Edward de Vere did not write Shakespeare's plays.\" Kirk Honeycutt ranked it as Emmerich's best film, with a superb cast of British actors, and a stunning digitally-enhanced recreation of London in Elizabethan times. The film is \"glorious fun as it grows increasingly implausible\", for the plot \"is all historical rubbish\". Damon Wise, reviewing the film for The Guardian, appraises Emmerich's \"meticulously crafted\" and \"stunningly designed takedown of the Bard\", as shocking only in that it is rather good. Emmerich's problem, he argues, is that he was so intent on proving his credentials as a serious director that the film ended up \"drowned in exposition\". Orloff's screenplay heavily confuses plotlines; the politics are retrofitted to suit the theory. The lead roles are \"unengaging\" but special mention is given to Edward Hogg's performance as Robert Cecil, and Vanessa Redgrave's role as Elizabeth. Robert Koehler of Variety reads the film as an \"illustrated argument\" of an \"aggressively promoted and more frequently debunked\" theory, and finds it less interesting than the actors who play a role in, or endorse, it. Narrative cogency is strained by the constant switches in time signature, and the imbroglio of Shakespeare and Jonson squabbling publicly over claims to authorship is both tiresome and \"veers close to comedy\"; indeed it is superfluous given Ifans's commanding and convincing acting as the \"real\" Shakespeare. The supporting cast of actors is praised for fine performances, except for Spall's Shakespeare, who is \"often so ridiculous that the 'Stratfordians' will feel doubly insulted.\" Sebastian Krawinkel's \"ambitious and gorgeous production design\" comes in for special mention, as does Anna J. Foerster's elegant widescreen lensing. The score, however, fails their standards. Kristopher Tapley champions the film, finding that Orloff has spun \"a fascinating yarn\". Ifans gives a stunning performance, and Spall's Shakespeare provides delightful comic relief. The film is \"gorgeous\" and Tapley agrees with a colleague's judgement that \"people will likely look back to Anonymous as the tipping point of what you can really do with digital in a next-level kind of way\". David Denby of The New Yorker writes of Emmerich's \"preposterous fantasia\", where confusion reigns as to which of the virgin queen's illegitimate children is Essex and which Southampton, and where it is not clear what the connection is between the plot to hide the authorship of the plays and the struggle to find a successor to the officially childless Elizabeth. He concludes that, \"The Oxford theory is ridiculous, yet the filmmakers go all the way with it, producing endless scenes of indecipherable court intrigue in dark, smoky rooms, and a fashion show of ruffs, farthingales, and halberds. The more far-fetched the idea, it seems, the more strenuous the effort to pass it off as authentic.\" James Lileks of Star Tribune, noting favourable responses, including one where a critic wondered if Emmerich had anything to do with it, says the devious message must be that a shlock-merchant like Emmerich wasn't involved, but, like the film plot itself, must conceal the hand of some more experienced filmmaker, whose identity will be much debated for centuries to come. Reviewing for Associated Press, Christy Lemire commends Rhys Ifans' performance as \"flamboyant, funny, sexy\" in an otherwise heavy-handed and clumsy film, whose script \"jumps back and forth in time so quickly and without rhyme or reason, it convolutes the narrative.\" A \"flow chart\" is perhaps needed to keep track of all of the sons, and sons of sons. The \"blubbering\" about the brilliance of Shakespeare's works is repetitive, and upstages the initial whiff of scandal, giving the impression that the film is \"much ado about nothing\". A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that Anonymous is \"a vulgar prank on the English literary tradition, a travesty of British history and a brutal insult to the human imagination\". Yet, a fine cast manages to \"burnish even meretricious nonsense with craft and conviction\", and one is \"tempted to suspend disbelief, even if Mr. Emmerich finally makes it impossible.\" Lou Lumenick, writing for the New York Post, writes that the movie \"is a thoroughly entertaining load of eye candy with solid performances, even if John Orloff's exposition-heavy script practically requires a concordance to follow at times.\" For The Globe and Mails Liam Lacey, \"the less you know about Shakespeare, the more you're likely to enjoy Anonymous.\" Ingenuity is wasted on an \"unintelligent enterprise\", that of arguing that people of humble origins cannot outwrite blue-bloods. Emmerich's CGI effects are well-done, but it is amazing just to watch an \"actor on a bare wooden stage, using nothing but a sequence of words that make your scalp prickle.\" Andrea Chase in Killer Movie Reviews rates Anonymous as \"superb\", dwelling on Orloff's rich script, which has \"done an excellent job of fitting the known facts to the thesis on offer\", on Emmerich's dramatic flair and the wonderful supporting cast. It is somewhat spoiled by Ifans's leaden presence, which betrays nothing of \"the ribald temper to be found in the plays.\" By contrast, Spall's Shakespeare, \"preening with the narcissist's elan of a confirmed ham, lights up the screen.\" Louise Keller for Urban Cinefile admires the \"thought-provoking scenario\" of Orloff's \"marvellous conspiracy story\", though its \"twists and turns\" are headspinning: \"anyone who can follow the first 30 minutes of the plot, must have been polishing the grey matter with advanced Sudoku: it's an unholy mess of complicated situations and jumps in time frame.\" Despite the exemplary cast, exquisite production design and extraordinary look, Emmerich has lost an opportunity to make more of it, \"on account of the jumbled, convoluted storyline that had me confused, frustrated and mentally scrambling to keep abreast of every detail\", though everything falls together in the final 45 minutes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The cast includes Griffin Dunne, Daniel Eric Gold, Anson Mount, Stephanie Romanov, Scott Adsit, Justine Cotsonas, and Chriselle Almeida. Last Night was produced by Entertainment One in association with the Gaumont Film Company, and deals with questions about emotional and physical infidelity. The film was developed as a romance and suspense story before Tadjedin recognized its moral significance.

Mendes originally turned down the role of Laura but agreed to appear in the film after a conversation with Tadjedin. Scenes were filmed in SoHo, Manhattan, between 2008 and 2009 with Peter Deming as the director of photography.

It is a sequel to the 1982 film Tron, whose director Steven Lisberger returned to produce. The cast includes Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprising their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley, respectively, as well as Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, James Frain, Beau Garrett and Michael Sheen. The story follows Flynn's adult son Sam, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality called \"the Grid,\" where Sam, his father, and the algorithm Quorra must stop the malevolent program Clu from invading the real world. Interest in creating a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, in and around the city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music. Tron: Legacy premiered in Tokyo on November 30, 2010 and was theatrically released in North America on December 17, 2010. Disney vigorously promoted the film across multiple media platforms, including merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews from film critics, who praised the visual effects, production design and soundtrack, but criticized the character development, cast performance and story. The film grossed $400\u00a0million during its worldwide theatrical run, making it a box office success.

As well as doing his work, he takes frequent telephone calls during Yankees games and passes the line scores on to the kitchen staff by arranging food items in a display case .  But he loses the job after he is ordered to deliver some flowers and lets someone close a car door on them when he gets distracted by a display of baseball scores in a shop window. Streetcar magnate W.S. Wilton comes to Pop's home to ask for his price to sell the car line, but Speedy spots a newspaper article and realizes that this is part of a plan to form a streetcar monopoly in the city.  He surreptitiously raises Pop's written price from $10,000 to $70,000.  Wilton angrily refuses and threatens to force Pop out instead. Speedy is unworried about being unemployed; he is very much used to losing jobs and finding new ones.  He and Jane go to Coney Island, where they greatly enjoy themselves despite various mishaps, such as Speedy ruining his suit jacket by leaning against wet paint.  On the way home along with a stray dog that decided to follow them, Speedy proposes to Jane, but she will not marry him until her grandfather's affairs are settled. Speedy is hired as a taxi driver, but for some time a series of mishaps prevents him from actually taking a passenger, and he antagonizes a policeman.

At the stadium, Speedy happens to overhear Wilton on the telephone. Wilton has learned that if Pop fails to operate the horsecar every 24 hours he will lose his right to the line, and orders goons to be sent to disrupt the operation.  Speedy rushes home and arranges with small-business owners on the street to organize a defense.  The goons are beaten off with the help of Speedy's dog, but return and steal the horse and car. Again helped by his dog, Speedy finds out where the car has been taken and manages to steal it back.  In a madcap chase scene, he brings it back across the city to Pop's tracks, stealing fresh horses, tricking police to avoid being stopped, and replacing a broken wheel with a manhole cover.

Most of the population of 2,812,000 are of African or partially African descent, with many being able to trace their origins to the West African countries of Ghana and Nigeria. Other major ancestral areas are Europe, South Asia, and East Asia. It is uncommon for Jamaicans to identify themselves by race as is prominent in other countries such as the United States, with most Jamaicans seeing Jamaican nationality as an identity in and of itself, identifying as simply being \"Jamaican\" regardless of ethnicity. The Jamaican Maroons of Accompong and other settlements are the descendants of African slaves who fled the plantations for the interior where they set up their own autonomous communities. Many Maroons continue to have their own traditions and speak their own language, known locally as Kromanti. Asians form the second-largest group and include Indo-Jamaicans and Chinese Jamaicans. Most are descended from indentured workers brought by the British colonial government to fill labour shortages following the abolition of slavery in 1838. Prominent Indian Jamaicans include jockey Shaun Bridgmohan, who was the first Jamaican in the Kentucky Derby, NBC Nightly News journalist Lester Holt, and Miss Jamaica World and Miss Universe winner Yendi Phillips. The southwestern parish of Westmoreland is famous for its large population of Indo-Jamaicans. Along with their Indian counterparts, Chinese Jamaicans have also played an integral part in Jamaica's community and history. Prominent descendants of this group include Canadian billionaire investor Michael Lee-Chin, supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyson Beckford, and VP Records founder Vincent \"Randy\" Chin. There are about 20,000 Jamaicans who have Lebanese and Syrian ancestry. Most were Christian immigrants who fled the Ottoman occupation of Lebanon in the early 19th century. Eventually their descendants became very successful politicians and businessmen. Notable Jamaicans from this group include former Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga, Jamaican politician and former Miss World Lisa Hanna, Jamaican politicians Edward Zacca and Shahine Robinson, and hotelier Abraham Elias Issa. In 1835, Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford gave 500 acres of his 10,000 acre estate in Westmoreland for the Seaford Town German settlement. Today most of the town's descendants are of full or partial German descent. The first wave of English immigrants arrived to the island 1655 after conquering the Spanish, and they have historically been the dominant group. Prominent descendants from this group include former American Governor of New York David Paterson, Sandals Hotels owner Gordon Butch Stewart, United States Presidential Advisor and \"mother\" of the Pell Grant Lois Rice, and former United States National Security Advisor and Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice. The first Irish immigrants came to Jamaica in the 1600s as war prisoners and later, indentured labour. Their descendants include two of Jamaica's National Heroes: Prime Ministers Michael Manley and Alexander Bustamante. Along with the English and the Irish, the Scots are another group that has made a significant impact on the island. According to the Scotland Herald newspaper, Jamaica has more people using the Campbell surnames than the population of Scotland itself, and it also has the highest percentage of Scottish surnames outside of Scotland. Scottish surnames account to about 60% of the surnames in the Jamaican phone books. The first Jamaican inhabitants from Scotland were exiled \"rebels\". Later, they would be followed by ambitious businessmen who spent time between their great country estates in Scotland and the island. As a result, many of the slave owning plantations on the island were owned by Scottish men, and thus a large number of mixed-race Jamaicans can claim Scottish ancestry. High immigration from Scotland continued until well after independence. Today, notable Scottish-Jamaicans include the businessman John Pringle, former American Secretary of State Colin Powell, and American actress Kerry Washington. There is also a significant Portuguese Jamaican population that is predominantly of Sephardic Jewish heritage. The first Jews arrived as explorers from Spain in the 15th century after being forced to convert to Christianity or face death. A small number of them became slave owners and even famous pirates. Judaism eventually became very influential in Jamaica and can be seen today with many Jewish cemeteries around the country. During the Holocaust Jamaica became a refuge for Jews fleeing persecution in Europe. Famous Jewish descendants include the dancehall artist Sean Paul, former record producer and founder of Island Records Chris Blackwell, and Jacob De Cordova who was the founder of the Daily Gleaner newspaper. In recent years immigration has increased, coming mainly from China, Haiti, Cuba, Colombia, and Latin America; 20,000 Latin Americans reside in Jamaica. In 2016, the Prime Minister Andrew Holness suggested making Spanish Jamaica's second official language. About 7,000 Americans also reside in Jamaica. Notable American with connection to the island include fashion icon Ralph Lauren, philanthropist Daisy Soros, Blackstone's Schwarzman family, the family of the late Lieutenant Governor of Delaware John W. Rollins, fashion designer Vanessa Noel, investor Guy Stuart, Edward and Patricia Falkenberg, and iHeart Media CEO Bob Pittman, all of whom hold annual charity events to support the island.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Does the man named Mr. Paradise represent some actual hope for paradise, as opposed to that offered by the Evangelist and Mrs. Connin? If so, clearly that hope is something beyond both the belief of the evangelist and Mrs. Connin, and the unbelief of Mr. Paradise, since neither are able to save Bevel. While Bevel's drowning in the river that promised him baptism and eternal life, that promised him that he would 'count' for something, is a grotesquely humorous irony, typical of O'Connor's stories, it might be pointed out that Bevel does indeed experience an epiphany of sorts as he is swept away to his death; 'for an instant he was overcome with surprise; then, since he was moving quickly and knew that he was getting somewhere, all his fury and his fear left him.' Baptism in Christian theology has long been associated with death and detachment; in baptism we enter into the death of Christ, undergoing a 'dying to sin' and a 'dying to self.' It is perhaps this dying to self that Bevel is experiencing as 'his fury and fear leave him' and why 'he knew he was getting somewhere.'", "hasanswer": false}]}

Directed by Klay Hall, it is a spin-off of Pixar's Cars franchise. Despite not being produced by Pixar, the film was co-written and executive produced by Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios' then-chief creative officer John Lasseter, who directed the first two Cars films. The film stars the voices of Dane Cook, Stacy Keach, Priyanka Chopra in her Hollywood debut, Brad Garrett, Teri Hatcher, Danny Mann, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Roger Craig Smith, John Cleese, Carlos Alazraqui, Sinbad, Val Kilmer, and Anthony Edwards. In this film, Dusty Crophopper, a crop duster plane who does all the cornfield work in the town of Propwash Junction, hopes to get the courage which he needs to fulfill his dream. He wants to complete Wings Around the Globe with racing planes, with the help of naval aviator Skipper Riley, who trains him, despite his fear of heights and not being built for racing. Like many of Disneytoon's films, Planes was initially set to be released as a direct-to-video film, but was instead theatrically released on August 9, 2013 in the Disney Digital 3D and RealD 3D formats. The film grossed $239.3 million worldwide on a $50 million budget, despite receiving negative reviews from critics.

AllMusic writes  \"Through and through, Exposed is an album directed at older tweens and teens, and it does tend to act its age, never presenting DeBarge as someone pretending to be any more wise or worldly than the average 19-year-old. Some of the material could use a shot of personality, but DeBarge is too relatable to deny. And though her voice has yet to fully develop and lacks the uniqueness running through her bloodline, it's clear she landed a major-label contract on the basis of her talent. Entertainment Weekly writes, \"the featherweight kiss-off \"Goodbye\", which cannily samples one-off wonder Steam's 1969 sports-stadium staple, \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\". It likely helped the 19-year-old land a gig opening for Britney Spears' Circus tour beginning this August, though Exposed'''s airy, girlish pop \u2013 especially cotton-candy Casio grooves like \"Future Love\" and \"Died in Your Eyes\" \u2013 mostly recalls the female stars of her dad's era: Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Paula Abdul, and Expos\u00e9.Blues & Soul states, Exposed \"showcases the teenage Ms. DeBarge's personal journey of self-discovery through a variety of musical moods -ranging from the robust urban pop of 'Somebody' and furiously-driving 'Sabotage' to more soulful cuts like the hauntingly yearning 'Future Love', sexily undulating 'It's Gotta Be Love', and the sadly surging break-up anthem 'Cried Me a River'\".Newsday states, \"Exposed is the result of all that work, featuring her light, effortless vocals tackling a lot of sweet, pretty pop \u2013 much of which was written and/or produced by Babyface. No wonder it all seems pretty inevitable. DeBarge comes across as a streetwise Jordin Sparks with the stomping smash 'Goodbye' and the new, more dance-oriented Rihanna-esque single 'Sabotage'. But what really sets her apart are the first-rate ballads that she flutters across, from the lovelorn 'Disconnect', which anyone from Miley Cyrus to Whitney Houston would have fought to get on their albums, to the simple, quirky piano ballad 'Doesn't Everybody Want to Fall in Love' that is also destined to be a smash. She even makes the tender, almost sappy 'Died in Your Eyes' work for her. Exposed really does unveil DeBarge, who's set to open for Britney Spears this fall, as a complete package and a music marketer's dream \u2013 a teenager who can sing grown-up songs and make them feel young, and feel comfortable with everything from hip-hop to Celine Dion ballads. Her wait to break into the public eye is about to be so totally worth it\".People praises DeBarge's album as \"a winning debut, fresh and seemingly sun-kissed, makes her this summer's answer to Rihanna. The two share a similar vocal timbre and the same pop charms. First single 'Goodbye', an undeniable dance-pop confection, recalls Rihanna's 'S.O.S. ', reworking Steam's 1969 hit 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye' much like 'S.O.S. ' did 'Tainted Love'. Meanwhile, another Babyface-produced track, 'It's Gotta Be Love', slyly borrows from LL Cool J's 'I Need Love'. Digital Spy praised DeBarge on a good first impression, though lacking top-notch material. \"Her girlish vocals are committed and surprisingly soulful, only slipping into stage schooly mannerisms occasionally, and she's equally comfortable doing vulnerable on 'Died In Your Eyes', empowered on 'Powerless', or a combination of the two on 'Cried Me a River'. She shows real glimpses of potential here, and having spent five years together already, it's safe to presume that DeBarge and her mentor are in it for the long haul.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

New York was then a centre of punk rock and what would come to be known as new wave, and Fripp became part of the scene, playing and recording with Blondie and the Roche sisters, absorbing the sounds of the active downtown music scene. He envisioned a new approach, and incorporated elements of these NYC experiences into his current palette, including \"Frippertronics\", the tape-delay/looping technique he had developed with Brian Eno. At Eno's invitation, Fripp performed on David Bowie's \"Heroes\" single and album in 1977. Originally, Fripp envisioned Exposure as the third part of a simultaneous trilogy also comprising Daryl Hall's Sacred Songs and Peter Gabriel's second album aka Scratch, both of which Fripp contributed to and produced. Fripp's aim with the trilogy \"was to investigate the 'pop song' as a means of expression. I think it's an incredibly good way of putting forward ideas. I think it's a supreme discipline to know that you have three to four minutes to get together all your lost emotions and find words of one syllable or less to put forward all your ideas. It's a discipline of form that I don't think is cheap or shoddy\". The album was to be originally titled The Last Great New York Heartthrob and feature a track list configuration different from that of the final release. Hall's management and label resisted the project, fearing the music would damage Hall's commercial appeal, insisting as well that Exposure be equally credited to Hall, initially Fripp's main vocalist. Fripp instead used only two Hall vocals on his album, substituting Peter Hammill and Terre Roche in various places. The trilogy did not work out as intended, although all the albums were released. \"Urban Landscape\" appears on the Hall album, as does \"NYCNY\" . The Gabriel record also features a version of \"Exposure\". \"Here Comes the Flood\" had previously appeared with a prog-rock arrangement on Gabriel's first album, but Gabriel disliked the production, and created a simpler rendition of the song for Exposure. Fripp stated in the liner notes that Exposure \"is indebted to all those who took part in the hazardous series of events culminating in this record, and several who do not appear but who helped determine the final shape: Tim Cappella, Alirio Lima, Ian McDonald and John Wetton\". The version of the album that was released, after the changes and compromises that had to be made, was reconceptualized as part of a new trilogy, \"The Drive to 1981\", marking the beginning of three-year campaigns by Fripp as a professional musician, which would include an album of Frippertronics and one of \"Discotronics\", to be released between September 1979 and September 1980. Both album concepts were released together as God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners, with each concept getting its own followup\uff0dThe League of Gentlemen for Discotronics and Let the Power Fall for Frippertronics, making for a five-step trilogy. The end of The Drive to 1981 marked the beginning of \"the incline to 1984\", Fripp's tenure with a reformed King Crimson, originally intended as Discipline. Fripp's tour to support Exposure was strictly a solo tour, utilizing only his own electric guitar and Frippertronics, and included then unorthodox rock music venues such as restaurants and retail outlets.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that \"life goes on\" and end the series with \"their heads held high\". In the finale, Callum Stone has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding.

Keaton used numerous elements seen in the film, including \"the wedding, the Model T and the use of the pages from a daily calendar to show the house being built in one week\" in his comic parody. Years later, Keaton told an interviewer that the film's title is a play on Three Weeks, a notorious 1907 sex novel by Elinor Glyn. Keaton reportedly joked that it was \"one-third as scandalous\". Knopf notes that One Week is Keaton's first attempt to move away from a plot-driven narrative, as he employed in his earlier film The High Sign, toward mining more and more gags from a few basic elements\u2014in this case, the house and ladders. According to Kevin Brownlow, One Week \"set the style for all the future Keatons; the opening gag sequence ... the slow build-up ... the frenetic climax ... and then that climax outmatched by the final sequence\". Furthermore, the film lay the basis for the cinematic techniques of his future films: \"The simple setups, the flat comedy lighting, the spare use of titles\u2014and the overall excellence of the direction\".

{"id": "164_1380", "question": "Who was the producer of Doctor Who theme music?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_3272", "text": "The Doctor Who theme music was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised. The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills, and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 . It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\" She answered \"Most of it.\" Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time. Derbyshire would not receive an on-screen credit until the 50th anniversary story \"The Day of the Doctor\" in 2013. A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 , which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 . Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for Doctor Who in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\". A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, \"Voyage of the Damned\"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series. He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers. In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special \"The Snowmen\", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" in November 2013. Versions of the \"Doctor Who Theme\" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, \"Who Is the Doctor\". In 1978, a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988, the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu released the single \"Doctorin' the Tardis\" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Gary Glitter . Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on The Chaser's War on Everything. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011, the Mankind version was released as a digital download on the album Gallifrey And Beyond.

As the band tried to lean towards a more hard rock sound, they felt that Johns was overemphasizing their country-influenced rock sound. Johns however felt that the Eagles were not capable of what the band wanted and told the band: \"You are not a rock-and-roll band, The Who is a rock-and-roll band, and you're not that.\"  The band\u2014Glenn Frey in particular, but not Don Henley\u2014were also unhappy with the no-drug policy of Johns during the recording; furthermore they did not feel at home recording in London. The band was concerned about the lack of success of the previous album Desperado, and were more assertive in wanting more input into the album, which Johns was unwilling to allow. The Eagles spent six weeks recording in London, with both the band and the producer becoming frustrated with each other and frequent arguments between Johns and Frey. The band then took a break, decided to find a new producer and discarded all the recordings except for two usable tracks, \"Best of My Love\" and \"You Never Cry Like a Lover\". The band relocated back to California and hired Bill Szymczyk, who had produced The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get by Joe Walsh\u2014who was also managed by their manager Irving Azoff and who would go on to join the Eagles in late 1975\u2014that interested the band. The band recorded the rest of the album at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. They were allowed more input in how the album was made and enjoyed more freedom with Szymczyk in the making of the album. Szymczyk suggested they bring in a harder-edged guitarist to add slide guitar to the song \"Good Day in Hell\". Bernie Leadon suggested his old friend Don Felder, whom they had met and jammed with on a few occasions. The band was so impressed that they invited Felder to become the fifth Eagle. The only other track on this album on which he appeared was \"Already Gone\". They credited him as a late arrival on the album's liner notes. On the difference in sound between Johns' and Szymczyk's productions, Henley said: \"There\u2019s a lot less echo with Bill, for one thing. There\u2019s more of a raw and funky presence. Glyn had a stamp he put on his records which is a deep echo that is really smooth like ice cream\". He thought that the production on the two songs that Johns produced was good and necessary. Frey, however, found that L.A. country-rock records were \"all too smooth and glassy\", and wanted a \"tougher sound\". Their friend and collaborator J. D. Souther ascribed the change of producer to \"Eagles\u2019 desire to get more of a live, thin sound on the albums\". The first two singles released were more rock-oriented; Frey was reluctant to release the Johns-produced \"Best of My Love\" as a single, and held off its release for some months. However, when it was finally released, the label had truncated the song\u2013without the band's knowledge or approval\u2013so that it would be more radio-friendly. \"Best of My Love\" would become their biggest hit thus far, and their first No. 1 on the charts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Cartman is distraught to discover that most of the park's attendants are people of different races, while Kyle is incredibly repulsed to learn so many people freely urinate in the pools. Based on his observance of more minorities at the park than white people, Cartman calculates there will be no white people left by the year 2012, and interprets this as a sign that Mayans accurately predicted the world would end the same year, and that the new world will be \"made up of minorities.\" Annoyed by Cartman's \"racism\", Kyle points out that since white people do not make up the majority of the park's attendance, then they are the new minority, but Cartman refuses to believe it, ignorantly thinking that a minority is someone who is \"black or brown.\" At the same time, Kyle walks by an elderly man and woman and finds out that the man peed in the pool, which disgusts Kyle. A bespectacled male scientist tests the park's water and discovers it is 98% urine. He urges Pi Pi, the park's Venetian owner, to immediately close and evacuate his park, claiming the high urine content will soon trigger a cataclysmic event. Pi Pi dismisses the warning. But when a little girl is shown urinating in a wave pool, the park is overcome and destroyed by tsunamis of yellow urine and volcanic eruptions. Hundreds of people drown in the subsequent flood, including Kenny, but the other boys manage to survive. The destroyed park is quarantined, and the scientist advises against a mission to rescue those trapped inside, fearing their exposure to \"pee contamination\" has turned them into dangerous, hate-filled mutants. To prove his theory, the scientist urinates onto a test monkey, which clearly becomes annoyed and enraged. An antidote to this reaction is then tested on other monkeys, but proven unsuccessful when the monkeys still become angered when urinated on. Meanwhile, Cartman clings to debris to stay afloat, while the other boys have reached higher ground. Cartman is rescued by the occupants of an inflatable raft from a water park ride. Noticing he is the only white person in the raft, Cartman assumes he is the \"last of his species,\" and that his envisioned 2012 scenario has occurred three years early. He imagines a world in which he must speak in minority slang, is paid lower wages, and eventually forced to live in a concentration camp. The other boys find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the inundation if someone can swim through the pee to reach an emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees to do the job as he said at the start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which makes Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest.

Initially, the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce lactase, an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk. People therefore converted milk to curd, cheese and other products to reduce the levels of lactose. Thousands of years ago, a chance mutation spread in human populations in Europe that enabled the production of lactase in adulthood. This mutation allowed milk to be used as a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed. Milk is processed into a variety of products such as cream, butter, yogurt, kefir, ice cream, and cheese. Modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein, whey protein, lactose, condensed milk, powdered milk, and many other food-additives and industrial products. Whole milk, butter and cream have high levels of saturated fat. The sugar lactose is found only in milk, and possibly in forsythia flowers and a few tropical shrubs. Lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, reaches its highest levels in the human small intestine immediately after birth, and then begins a slow decline unless milk is consumed regularly. Those groups who continue to tolerate milk have often exercised great creativity in using the milk of domesticated ungulates, not only cattle, but also sheep, goats, yaks, water buffalo, horses, reindeer and camels. India is the largest producer and consumer of cattle- and buffalo milk in the world.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hilton built a small house situated half-way between Greeley and Fort Collins. The \u201chalf-way\u201d house, as it became known, directed travelers along a route, which was soon adopted by the Greeley, Salt Lake and Pacific railway. The railroad brought investors and farmers to Windsor in increasing numbers. Windsor's rich alluvial plains lent themselves to extensive wheat production and the establishment of one of the town's first commercial enterprises, a flour mill, which through a subsequent fire in 1899, was rebuilt and became the Windsor Milling and Elevator Company. A rich wheat farming district, the area around Windsor first drew permanent residents in the early 1870s. Two factors were to play a critical role in stimulating Windsor's early development: irrigation and the railroad. Irrigation increased crop variety and production and the railroad shipped this bounty to market. The town was platted in 1882, the same year the Windsor Railroad Depot was built, and incorporated in 1890. It was named for the Rev. Samuel Asa Windsor. By 1900, tariffs on foreign sugar had created a market for new sources of sugar. Research in the improved cultivation of sugar beets was taking place at Colorado Agricultural College in Fort Collins, and the capital to advance production and manufacture of beet sugar was coming together. In 1903 a factory for producing sugar from sugar beets was built in Windsor. Sugar beet cultivation required large numbers of \"stoop laborers,\" a need that was met by ethnic German immigrants from Russia. With large families and a strong work ethic, the German-Russians who settled in Windsor and other sugar beet areas would achieve financial success within one generation and own the highest producing beet farms. The Great Western Sugar Company fueled Windsor's economy through the mid-1960s, when the Windsor factory closed. Plentiful water and land drew Kodak to Windsor where it opened a manufacturing plant on the heels of the sugar factory's closing. Kodak's opening spurred economic development in the town, and a population surge as the sugar beet factory closed.  Later in the 1980s Metal Container Corporation opened a can factory and Deline Box Company opened a factory, which closed in December 2010, that primarily served the Budweiser facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. In the last two decades, its central location among the population centers of northern Colorado, together with its proximity to Interstate 25, have made it the site of rapid urban growth, particularly on the western edge of town, as it grows towards the interchange on I-25. In the 1990s, the town limits were westward into Larimer County. The incorporated town limits west of Interstate 25 are now contiguous with Loveland, and are separated from southeast Fort Collins by the Fossil Creek Open Space public lands of Larimer County acquired through a county-wide vote-approved sales tax. In this century, there has been significant industrial development on the southeast side of town.  Vestas has a wind turbine factory, and several related companies, Hexcel and Ice Energy have headquarters in Windsor.  Owens Illinois has a glass factory that primarily serves the Budweiser facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. Windsor has also attracted digital services providers in recent years, such as farm management software provider Agworld whose North American headquarters is based here. Windsor ranked No. 1 in a study  of the \"Best Cities to Live in Colorado,\" from 2014. The town's low crime rate, ideal location and nearby amenities helped it beat out other favorable locations in the state.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is surrounded by five landlocked countries: Kazakhstan to the north; Kyrgyzstan to the northeast; Tajikistan to the southeast; Afghanistan to the south, Turkmenistan to the south-west. Its capital and largest city is Tashkent. Uzbekistan is part of the Turkic languages world, as well as a member of the Organisation of Turkic States. Uzbek language is the majority-spoken language in Uzbekistan. Islam is the predominant religion in Uzbekistan, most Uzbeks being Sunni Muslims. The first recorded settlers on what is now Uzbekistan were Eastern Iranian nomads, known as Scythians, who founded kingdoms in Khwarazm , Bactria , Sogdia , Fergana , and Margiana . The area was incorporated into the Iranian Achaemenid Empire and, after a period of Macedonian rule, was ruled by the Iranian Parthian Empire and later by the Sasanian Empire, until the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century. The Early Muslim conquests and the subsequent Samanid Empire converted most of the people, including the local ruling classes, into adherents of Islam. During this period, cities such as Samarkand, Khiva, and Bukhara began to grow rich from the Silk Road, and witnessed the emergence of leading figures of the Islamic Golden Age, including Muhammad al-Bukhari, Al-Tirmidhi, al Khwarizmi, al-Biruni, Avicenna and Omar Khayyam. The local Khwarazmian dynasty and Central Asia as a whole were decimated by the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, after which the region became dominated by Turkic peoples. The city of Shahrisabz was the birthplace of the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur , who in the 14th century established the Timurid Empire and was proclaimed the Supreme Emir of Turan with his capital in Samarkand, which became a centre of science under the rule of Ulugh Beg, giving birth to the Timurid Renaissance. The territories of the Timurid dynasty were conquered by Uzbek Shaybanids in the 16th century, moving the centre of power to Bukhara. The region was split into three states: the Khanate of Khiva, Khanate of Kokand and Emirate of Bukhara. Conquests by Emperor Babur towards the east led to the foundation of India's newest invasions as Mughal Empire. All of Central Asia was gradually incorporated into the Russian Empire during the 19th century, with Tashkent becoming the political center of Russian Turkestan. In 1924, national delimitation created the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic as an independent republic within the Soviet Union. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it declared independence as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August 1991. Uzbekistan is a secular state, with a presidential constitutional government in place. Uzbekistan comprises 12 regions , Tashkent City and one autonomous republic, Karakalpakstan. While non-governmental human rights organisations have defined Uzbekistan as \"an authoritarian state with limited civil rights\", significant reforms under Uzbekistan's second president's administration have been made following the death of the first president Islam Karimov. Owing to these reforms, relations with the neighbouring countries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan have drastically improved. A United Nations report of 2020 found much progress toward achieving the UN's sustainable development goals. The Uzbek economy is in a gradual transition to the market economy, with foreign trade policy being based on import substitution. In September 2017, the country's currency became fully convertible at market rates. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton. With the gigantic power-generation facilities from the Soviet era and an ample supply of natural gas, Uzbekistan has become the largest electricity producer in Central Asia. From 2018 to 2021, the republic received a BB- rating by both Standard and Poor and Fitch. Strengths indicated by Brookings Institution include Uzbekistan having large liquid assets, high economic growth, and low public debt.

She worked in a McDonald's restaurant in her hometown, until 1998. She was chosen to be in the second generation of Morning Musume.  After they joined, Morning Musume went on to produce one album and three more singles until Asuka Fukuda decided to leave to pursue her studies. Yasuda was given almost all of Fukuda's lines in future performances of these early songs. She had also collaborated with other Morning Musume members in special projects during these early days. One of the more notable ones was when she co-wrote and co-sang with Natsumi Abe the song \"Sanpo\" for a radio contest. It became wildly popular and a petition was circulated to make it an official single, though that never happened. Yasuda and Ichii sang a particularly catchy duet known as \"Otome no Shinrigaku\" on Morning Musume's second album. In response to the popularity, Tsunku decided to group them together with the third generation member, Maki Goto to create the Morning Musume subgroup Petitmoni in 1999. Their first single, \"Chokotto Love,\" sold over a million copies. After Ichii left Morning Musume and Petitmoni, fourth generation member Hitomi Yoshizawa joined the subgroup. Yasuda had taken on the role of leader for Petitmoni and the group continued to produce three singles and an album. After Morning Musume's then-leader Yuko Nakazawa left in 2001, Yasuda became a co-leader along with Kaori Iida. Yasuda left in mid-2003 at the same time when Morning Musume's 6th generation became full-fledged members. Tsunku commented that this one-time sixteen-member formation will be the largest Morning Musume. During her good-bye concert, Yasuda sang a remixed rock version of \"Never Forget,\" which was also Fukuda's good-bye song. Additionally, as a special gift, Tsunku gave Yasuda a CD of her own solo version of \"As for One Day,\" her last single with Morning Musume. Following Yasuda's leaving, Iida became the leader of Morning Musume and Yaguchi became sub-leader. The Petitmoni leadership was handed over to Yoshizawa, and two members were added and Goto left. This new line up of Petitmoni never had another release, but a few of their songs were featured on compilation albums. Yasuda was still in the Hello! Project after leaving the group, and acted in dramas outside of H!P. Within H!P, she has collaborated with Nakazawa and other H!P artists on two Folk Songs albums, performed and MC'd Abe's first solo concert, sang backup on Goto's single \"Daite Yo! Please Go On,\" and hosted Morning Musume's weekly TV show Hello! Morning until Rika Ishikawa took that position. Yasuda participated in the H.P. All Stars single \"All for One & One For All\" and the Puripuri Pink shuffle unit. Puripuri Pink was a new type of shuffle unit, since it was the first unit to feature former Morning Musume members, who were usually not included in the shuffles. During a promotional appearance on Utaban in 2004, Yasuda revealed that she has been learning how to play the flute. Yasuda graduated from Hello!

That practice was ended with the Declaration of Independence by the United States in 1776. Britain decided in 1786 to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by Cook some 16 years earlier. Captain Phillip led the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water. He travelled a short way further north and arrived at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788. This was to become the location of the new colony. Phillip described Port Jackson as being \"without exception the finest harbour in the world\". The colony was at first to be titled \"New Albion\" , but Phillip decided on \"Sydney\", whom he named after Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. The official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 February 1788. Lieutenant William Dawes produced a town plan in 1790, but it was ignored by the colony's leaders, and Sydney's layout today reflects this lack of planning. Between 1788 and 1792, 3,546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney, many of them \"professional criminals\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce. From 1791 on, however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies. The colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity. Maps from this time show no prison buildings; the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration, but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging. Phillip sent exploratory missions in search of better soils and fixed on the Parramatta region as a promising area for expansion, and moved many of the convicts from late 1788 to establish a small township, which became the main centre of the colony's economic life, leaving Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and Toongabbie, but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land. The region's indigenous population was also suffering. It is estimated that half the native people in Sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 1789. Enlightened for his time, Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers \u2013 most notably Watkin Tench \u2013 left journals and accounts that tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Part of Macquarie's effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re-enter society as free citizens. Roads, bridges, wharves, and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and by 1822 the town had banks, markets, and well-established thoroughfares. Parramatta Road was opened in 1811, being one of Sydney's oldest roads and Australia's first highway between two cities \u2013 Sydney and Parramatta. Conditions in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving metropolis, but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade helped to lessen the burden of isolation. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their jailers made up the majority of the population; in one generation, however, a population of emancipated convicts who could be granted land began to grow. These people pioneered Sydney's private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired, and later still by free settlers who began arriving from Britain. Governor Phillip departed the colony for England on 11 December 1792, with the new settlement having survived near starvation and immense isolation for four years.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This is not reflected in the album's music, which incorporates elements of progressive rock and, according to biographer Tony Fletcher, it was produced in such a way as to appeal to commercial rock radio at the time. The album showcased some of Townshend's most complicated arrangements, with multiple layers of synthesizer and strings. Many of the songs also revisited themes from Townshend's long-contemplated Lifehouse project, featuring lyrics about songwriting and music as a metaphor for life, as indicated by titles like \"Guitar and Pen\", \"New Song\", \"Music Must Change\", and \"Sister Disco\". The latter two, along with \"Who Are You\", ultimately appeared on Lifehouse Chronicles, Townshend's later actualization of the project. Several of the song's lyrics also reflect Townshend's uncertainty about the Who's continued relevance in the wake of punk rock, and his dissatisfaction with the music industry. There was a three-year hiatus between Who Are You and the Who's previous album, The Who by Numbers. The band was drifting apart during this period, as band members were working on various solo projects, and Moon was driving deeper into drug and alcohol abuse. The initial sessions at Ramport Studios, produced by Glyn Johns and Jon Astley, were lackadaisical; Jon Astley recalled that \"no one wanted to work\", and the members looked forward more to drinking and reminiscing at six in the evening. Astley felt that he and Johns pushed Moon too hard to play a simpler style, while Johns believed that Moon had \"lost confidence in his ability\" and would deliberately go out of his way to resist his suggestions. Moon's health was especially an object of concern, as his drumming skills had noticeably deteriorated and his performances for most of the sessions were substandard. He was unable to play in 6/8 time on the track \"Music Must Change\", so the drums were removed completely from the track, and replaced with the sound of footsteps and a few cymbal crashes. Bassist John Entwistle remarked that Moon \"couldn't think of anything to play.\" On another occasion, Astley recalled, \"I was doing a drum track, and he hadn't learned the song. I actually had to stand up and conduct. He said, 'Can you give me a cue when you get to the middle part?' [...] He hadn't done his homework.\" Entwistle similarly described Moon as \"really out of condition\", and \"disgusted with himself\" as a result. The recording was further delayed when lead singer Roger Daltrey underwent throat surgery, and when during a lengthy Christmas break, Townshend sliced his hand in a window during an argument with his parents. Former Zombies and Argent member Rod Argent was also called in to replace session keyboardist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick after Bundrick suffered a broken arm falling out of a taxi at the studio door. When the sessions resumed in March, they were moved to RAK Studios, which caused further delays due to the equipment malfunctioning, including the wiping of a backing track. Astley stated that the RAK equipment made the existing material sound different when played back, necessitating further delays as he attempted to fix the audio problems. In one incident, Daltrey punched Johns in the face due to an argument over a rough mix, rendering him unconscious. The argument was fueled by Ted Astley adding a string arrangement to \"Had Enough\", which Daltrey derided as \"slushy\". After one long and frustrating day, Townshend planned to fire Moon from the band unless he cleaned up his act. The plan drove Moon to attempt to kick his alcohol habit and work more enthusiastically. Due to a prior commitment to produce the Joan Armatrading album To the Limit, Johns had to leave in April, with Astley remaining as sole producer. Under Astley's command, the sessions returned to Ramport, with all of the drums except for \"Who Are You\" recorded in the last two weeks of production. Who Are You was released on 18 August 1978. Moon died on 7 September 1978, just under a month after the album's release; on the cover, he is shown sitting in a chair labelled \"Not to be taken away\".

The distinctive location filming in the Napa Valley and the dry, wryly humorous tone of the scripts gave the series a personality of its own. The rivalry between Angela, Chase, and Richard stayed at the core of the show for several years, as more romantic entanglements spun around them. Lance and Cole found themselves not only caught up in their family battles for control of Falcon Crest, but were also competing for Melissa's affections. Like its counterparts, Falcon Crest employed memorable end-of-season cliffhangers to boost ratings. The 1982\u201383 season ended with the resolution of a murder mystery \"whodunit\" plot that had spanned most of the season. The killer was revealed in front of the entire cast, only to produce a handgun. Shots were fired as the camera panned away from the mansion, fading into the final scene of a rose-draped coffin being lowered into the ground, leaving the audience to wonder who had been killed. The third-season cliffhanger in 1984 involved a plane crash carrying most of the major characters, resulting in three of their deaths. A bomb explosion which ended the fourth season left Richard and Maggie in peril, and an earthquake that rippled through the valley ended the fifth season. The cliffhanger of the sixth season put Chase, Melissa, Richard, newcomer Dan Fixx and Maggie's baby in danger of drowning in the San Francisco Bay area. At the end of the seventh season, Melissa had finally wrested complete control of Falcon Crest away from Angela, while Richard was apparently murdered by \"The Thirteen\", a powerful group of shady businessmen whom he had turned against. Falcon Crest was a top ten series from 1982 to 1985 , airing after Dallas on Friday nights at 10:00\u00a0p.m. The series also frequently cast former Hollywood royalty in guest roles: Lana Turner, Gina Lollobrigida, Mel Ferrer, Cesar Romero, Robert Stack, Cliff Robertson, Celeste Holm, Lauren Hutton, Ursula Andress and Kim Novak all appeared on Falcon Crest. This aspect to the series seemed to be well-embraced by the producers, who at one stage instituted a rotating guest-star policy. Leslie Caron, Lauren Hutton, Eddie Albert, Eve Arden, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Ursula Andress all made appearances during the 1987\u20131988 season, as did Rod Taylor, who would remain with the series until its cancellation in 1990.

Charlie uses speakers in his offices to communicate with the Angels, and his assistant Bosley works with them directly when needed. Charlie assigns the Angels to find Eric Knox , a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company, Knox Enterprises. Knox is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin , who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar. The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot a suspicious-looking man that they had previously seen from surveillance videos of Knox's kidnapping. Dubbing him the \"Thin Man\" , the Angels chase him down and fight him; he gets away, but the Angels find Knox, safely held nearby. After the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood , Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Thin Man has stolen Knox's voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer. Dylan takes up Knox's offer to spend the night with him, and they end up having sex. Afterwards, Knox betrays her; simultaneously, attacks are made on Natalie and Alex, Bosley is captured by Vivian, and Corwin is murdered by the Thin Man. Knox tells Dylan his kidnapping was all faked to get the Angels to help him access the Redstar satellite network. He plans to use it along with his voice recognition software to find and kill Charlie, who Knox asserts killed his father in the Vietnam War. Dylan escapes and reunites with Natalie and Alex, who survived their attacks. They approach Charlie's office just as the building explodes. They find a radio transmitter that Bosley is able to communicate through via a tooth implanted radio transmitter. Bosley provides enough information of where he's captured to allow Natalie to deduce its location, an abandoned lighthouse. With help from Dylan's boyfriend Chad , the Angels stealthily approach it. Upon finding Knox, Dylan is captured by his henchmen, and is tied up and gagged. The Angels are too late to stop Knox from determining Charlie's location, though they rescue Bosley while Dylan fights off her captors. They come together to defeat Vivian, the Thin Man, and other assorted henchmen, but Knox blows up the lighthouse and flies off in an attack helicopter towards Charlie's house. Bosley helps the Angels board it, where Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards; blowing up the helicopter and killing Knox while the Angels land safely. Seeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, they enter the nearby beach house that Knox had targeted, but Charlie has already left. He remotely congratulates the Angels on a job well done through another speaker, and treats them and Bosley to a vacation. Charlie also tells them that Knox's father was undercover; he was discovered and killed, but not by Charlie. When he speaks to the Angels by telephone on the beach, they ask if they could ever meet him in person. Dylan suspects she sees him nearby talking into a cell phone, but does not tell the group; opting to raise a toast to Charlie instead. Bosley playfully douses the Angels with his drink, and they chase him towards the ocean. From afar, a silhouetted Charlie watches them and walks off.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world. Joey's catchphrase, \"How you doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech. Friends has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, BTS member RM and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters. Friends is parodied in the twelfth season Murder, She Wrote episode \"Murder Among Friends.\" In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher investigates the murder of a writer for Buds, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved Murder, She Wrote from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite Friends on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and Murder, She Wrotes supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\" Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of Buds by watching episodes of Friends. Producers of Married... with Children attempted to create a spinoff series called Enemies, which was intended to act as an antithesis to Friends in the same way Married... with Children had been to family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show. However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series. The Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by Friends, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses also contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing Friends episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai caf\u00e9, where he worked as a waiter. Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004. From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold real coffee to customers and featured a display of Friends memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football.\" In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010. In India, there are six Friends-themed cafes, located in Chandigarh ; Kolkata; and West Bengal , which features many icons from the original T.V. series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra. There are two Friends themed cafes in Pakistan as wellone in Lahore, Punjab known as \"Friends Cafe\" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called \"Central Perk\". Both of those cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and even episode reruns on a projector. They're also planning to have their own Gunther at the bar. In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The caf\u00e9 also includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show. In August 2019, it was announced that a Central Perk Lego set would be launched to mark the show's 25 anniversary. Friends has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \"all you need are good friends\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other. Vox stated that Friends impacted the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is How I Met Your Mother, which The Guardians TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with Friends, Manhattan.

Due to the economy, they could not make the film that year. They were then inspired by the concept of Buy Nothing Day, an international day of protest against consumerism, and decided to experience a Buy Nothing summer. They spent two months in 2009 with proponents of freeganism, which is a practice of eating \"discarded food in their pursuit of a moneyless existence\". Marling said, \"We wanted to have some adventure, and we didn't have any money. We learned to hop trains, we learned to sleep on rooftops, we learned to claim the space that feels so private. We joined this anarchist collective.\" The pair drew from their experiences as well as thriller films like All The President's Men, The Bourne Identity and Michael Clayton to craft The East, which they wrote before they began filming Sound of My Voice for a 2011 release. Batmanglij and Marling wrote to have the anarchist organization target a multinational corporation instead of a government. Marling said, \"Multinational corporations are outside of the purview of any nation-state. These are the entities that are shaping and running the world... The modern anarchy movement is about rebelling against the corporate structure.\" Batmanglij said the film focused on the pharmaceutical industry due to the writers hearing stories about the side effects of drugs, such as a drug to help quit smoking that resulted in some people committing suicide. He said they considered focusing on banks due to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, but they chose the pharmaceutical industry so the mission in the film would have emotional resonance. They titled the film The East to make a variety of references. The director explained, \"'The East' is ... the East Coast, which is like something in our American collective consciousness\u2014New England, tony, center of power. The Wicked Witch of the East in the Oz mythology was the bad witch because the book was about how the Midwest was getting screwed over by the east, by Washington. And then of course we have the Middle East or the Far East, which is seen as different or other. The ultimate Other. So, it's funny that this word means two things, and I thought that was an interesting name for a resistance group that is combined of kids from New England who want to make themselves the Other.\" Sound of My Voice, directed by Batmanglij and starring Marling, screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in January. Producer Michael Costigan, who liked Sound of My Voice, got a copy of the screenplay for The East. Costigan liked the screenplay and approached Batmanglij to say that he and his fellow producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott at Scott Free Productions were interested in making the film. After the festival, Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired distribution rights for Sound of My Voice and Another Earth . In the process, the distributor greenlighted production of The East. By September 2011, Marling and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd were cast in the starring roles. Felicity Jones was attached to play Izzy, but she dropped out to promote Like Crazy. Jones was replaced by Elliot Page. Production of the film, which had a budget of , took place in Shreveport, Louisiana. Production designer Alex DiGerlando converted an alternative lifestyle club in Shreveport into a house for The East. The club was originally painted black and gold, and it was repainted different shades of green for the film. Filming took place in late 2011; Batmanglij said it lasted .

I think he plays that frustration well. I also love his [Chad's] connection to Vivien in that he and Vivien are both with sex addicts.

To compensate for this loss, co-executive producers Vince Gilligan and John Shiban decided to write an episode based around The Lone Gunmen. The writers wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines, mostly notably the disappearance of Susanne Modeski, who had last appeared in season five's \"The Unusual Suspects\". Gilligan explained, \"I'd been thinking a lot about what happened to Susanne Modeski\u2014what happened to her after she drove off with X in that mysterious car at the end of 'Unusual Suspects'\". Gilligan and Shiban soon formulated a plot that revolved around the Lone Gunmen in Las Vegas, \"Las Vegas just seemed a really good place to put these guys\", according to Gilligan. He explained: \"First of all, because the idea of them running through a casino is instantly hilarious. But the other thing [...] is that Las Vegas is in some ways the most watched city in the world\".

The Football Association is the oldest governing body in the sport, with the rules of football first drafted in 1863 by Ebenezer Cobb Morley. The FA Cup and The Football League were the first cup and league competitions respectively. In the modern day, the Premier League is the world's most-watched football league, most lucrative, and amongst the elite. As is the case throughout the UK, football in England is notable for the rivalries between clubs and the passion of the supporters, which includes a tradition of football chants.

This line-up was to stay constant until 1996, except from a short spell, when Weathers was unwell, and Rick Martinez temporarily took over. After rehearsals, their first gig was on All Fools Day at the Marquee Club in London, and in June 1983 they recorded Friday 13th at The Marquee, but this comprised old numbers, not new material.  Not having a recording contract to promote them, albums were issued on several labels, e.g. Friday 13th was also issued as Live at the Marquee and Talk about a Morning . Later that year, they played the Reading Festival which was recorded for Tommy Vance's Friday Rock Show and released as Live at Reading '83 in 1993. In 1983, they also recorded an album of new material in Germany, but fell out with the producer, who was also the album's promoter, so the album was never issued.  The first studio album to be issued, The Twang Dynasty, was issued in 1992 and included the track \"Fast and Dangerous\", which was used on trailers for Paul Whitehouse's Fast Show, although the band were not paid for this. Their performance at 1994's Glastonbury Festival was issued as Live 1994 - Official Bootleg , and in 1995 they recorded Call Down the Moon issued on the Hypertension label, and produced by the band and Ron Sanchez \u2013 a US musician and DJ, who had long championed their cause. Weathers left in 1996, allegedly because Gentle Giant were about to reform, and was replaced by returning drummer Terry Williams, who in the interim, had served in bands such as Dire Straits. Williams recorded some tracks, later released on the Undrugged album, and then Leonard suffered a minor stroke, so the band played a few gigs as a three-piece.  When Leonard returned in 1997, Williams left, to be replaced by drummer Bob Richards, formerly of 'The Wild Family' and 'The Adrian Smith Band'. Former keyboardist Phil Ryan returned in 1998, taking the band back to the classic five-piece line-up, which recorded a live double album 1998 at the Star Club at The Star Club, Oberhausen, West Germany, in March that year. Ryan played a major role in producing Endangered Species , but then had to withdraw from the band for personal reasons. Ryan was replaced by Gareth Llewellyn Thorrington, who missed the recording of Down Town Live at the Down Town Blues Club, Hamburg, in May 2001, as his flight was cancelled due a bomb-scare, but appeared on part of the Undrugged album , which had been started in 1996, and was finally issued in 2002. Undrugged has some classic covers, including \"Sail on, Sailor\" by the Beach Boys and Ray Charles's \"Georgia on My Mind\", both lead vocals being by Micky Jones. In 2002, Micky Jones was diagnosed with a brain tumour and had to take time off for treatment. Jones's place was temporarily taken by his son George Jones, but when Micky had recovered enough to rejoin, in 2004, Leonard decided to leave, again, so George became a permanent member of the band.  In 2005, Micky Jones' health deteriorated due to the re-occurrence of his brain tumour and he was replaced by Martin Ace's son Josh Ace. In November 2006, the album Diamonds and Coal was released, after which Thorrington was sacked, and the band continued as a four-piece.  The 40th anniversary tour in 2008 saw the return of Ryan on keyboards, giving a multi-generational line-up, with two early members , two sons of early members and drummer Bob Richards, who had been in the band since 1997. This line-up also recorded a studio album, but before it was mixed, the band split. Josh Ace, Martin Ace and Phil Ryan recruited James Beck and Rene Robrahn to the new line-up and wiped parts of the album to replace George Jones.  Bob Richards's parts were kept on as they were unable to record over them, due to the lack of a click track.  This album, Kingdom of Noise, was finally released in June 2009. George Jones and Bob Richards formed a new band 'Son of Man', together with Richie Galloni , Marco James and Ray Jones from Welsh band Sassafras and Glenn Quinn from Tigertailz. As of 2020 they are continuing to play Man's music at gigs around England and Wales, having released Son of Man, an album of new material in October 2016. Their second album State Of Dystopia was released in March 2020. After leaving Man, Micky Jones continued to perform for a while, but was then diagnosed with another tumour; he spent the next year and a half in and out of hospital; his health meant he remained at a care home in Swansea for the next three years until he died peacefully, at the age of 63, on 10 March 2010. Clive John, AKA Clint Space, another of the founding members, died after a long fight against emphysema on 24 August 2011 in Hanover Street, Swansea, aged 66. Former bassist Ken Whaley died from lung cancer on 8 May 2013, aged 66. Phil Ryan remained in the band until his death on 30 April 2016, aged 69. A new album, Reanimated Memories, was launched at a gig at The Half Moon, Putney on 22 February 2015, the band's first performance in the UK since October 2011. In 2015 Swansea Museum mounted an exhibition, The Evolution of Man 1965-2014, Acid Rock from Wales, displaying Man memorabilia from the last 50 years, from the collection of local fan, John Bannon. On 31 January 2017 Deke Leonard, one of the founding members of the group and an essential part of the group's history, died at the age of 72. On 13 September 2017, Will Youatt died peacefully in his sleep. Since 2011 Man have been based in Germany, where they still perform occasionally, including autumn tours in 2012 and 2013, and a short UK tour in 2019. For their 50th anniversary tour in 2018, Shane Dixon joined the band as the new drummer and Malcolm Morley returned to play keyboards. Their latest album Anachronism Tango was released in October 2019. Bassist John McKenzie died on 10 May 2020 at the age of 64.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although activists tend to believe that it was because of the publicity generated by the film, it has been reported that the delay was due to the weather and rough seas. According to campaigners, out of the 100 dolphins captured on September 9, some were taken to be sold to marine museums and the rest were released, while 50 pilot whales were killed and sold for meat on the same day. While campaigners claim that it has become apparent that The Cove is having an impact on the way in which Japanese fisherman normally conduct the dolphin hunt, on March 23, 2010, the Japanese government stated \"The dolphin hunting is a part of traditional fishery of this country and it has been lawfully carried out.\" Upon the film winning the Oscar, the town mayor of Taiji and the chief of Taiji Fishery Union said \"The hunt is performed legally and properly with the permission of Wakayama Prefecture [local government].\"  Taiji assemblyman Hisato Ryono, one of the two local legislators who broke ranks and publicly called for removal of dolphin meat from school lunches, said he was lied to by the documentary's producers about what the film would contain. Since the release of the film, a much larger number of activists, mainly non-Japanese, have visited Taiji to protest or film the dolphin hunts. The Taiji fishermen responded by constructing an elaborate structure of tarps to better conceal the drive-hunting activities in and around the cove. Filmmaker Megumi Sasaki has argued that the film and subsequent activism and campaigning by foreigners with Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have been poorly received by the population of Taiji, and that backlash has resulted in the practice continuing.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film follows Las Vegas magician Burt Wonderstone as he attempts to reunite with his former partner Anton Marvelton to take on dangerous street magician Steve Gray . It also features Alan Arkin, Olivia Wilde, and James Gandolfini in his final film appearance during his lifetime. The film began development in 2006, when New Line Cinema bought Kultgen's script, \"Burt Dickenson: The Most Powerful Magician on Planet Earth\". The development process gained momentum when Charles McDougall was hired as director in 2011, but he eventually left the project and was replaced with Scardino.

GDP annual average growth was 2.9% in 2016 and 2% in 2017. Agriculture has comprised 4% of the economy over the last two decades, while industry contributes 33% and services contribute 63%. Mexico's GDP in PPP per capita was US$18,714.05. The World Bank reported in 2009 that the country's Gross National Income in market exchange rates was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US$1,830.392\u00a0billion, which led to the highest income per capita in the region at $15,311. Mexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006, even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth. The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively. By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy. Although multiple international organizations coincide and classify Mexico as an upper middle income country, or a middle class country Mexico's National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy , which is the organization in charge to measure the country's poverty reports that a huge percentage of Mexico's population lives in poverty. According to said council, from 2006 to 2010 the portion of Mexicans who live in poverty rose from 18%\u201319% to 46% . However, rather than Mexico's economy crashing, international economists attribute the huge increase in the percentage of population living below the country's poverty line to the CONEVAL using new standards to define it, as now besides people who lives below the economic welfare line, people who lacks at least one \"social need\" such as complete education, access to healthcare, access to regular food, housing services and goods, social security etc. were considered to be living in poverty . Said economists do point out that the percentage of people living in poverty according to Mexico's national poverty line is around 40 times higher than the one reported by the World Bank's international poverty line and ponder if it would not be better for countries in the situation of Mexico to adopt internationalized standards to measure poverty so the numbers obtained could be used to make accurate international comparisons. According to the OECD's own poverty line 20% of Mexico's population lives in a situation of poverty. Among the OECD countries, Mexico has the second-highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich, after Chile\u00a0\u2013 although it has been falling over the last decade, being one of few countries in which this is the case. The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average. This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world. According to a 2008 UN report the average income in a typical urbanized area of Mexico was $26,654, while the average income in rural areas just miles away was only $8,403. Daily minimum wages are set annually being set at $102.68 Mexican pesos in 2019. All of the indices of social development for the Mexican Indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average, which is motive of concern for the government. The electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011. The Mexican electronics industry is dominated by the manufacture and OEM design of televisions, displays, computers, mobile phones, circuit boards, semiconductors, electronic appliances, communications equipment and LCD modules. The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009. Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports. Mexico produces the most automobiles of any North American nation. The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities. The \"Big Three\" have been operating in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the 1960s. In Puebla alone, 70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen. In the 2010s expansion of the sector was surging. In 2014 alone, more than $10 billion in investment was committed. In September 2016 Kia motors opened a $1 billion factory in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, with Audi also opening an assembling plant in Puebla the same year. BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan currently have plants in construction. The domestic car industry is represented by DINA S.A., which has built buses and trucks since 1962, and the new Mastretta company that builds the high-performance Mastretta MXT sports car. In 2006, trade with the United States and Canada accounted for almost 50% of Mexico's exports and 45% of its imports. During the first three quarters of 2010, the United States had a $46.0 billion trade deficit with Mexico. In August 2010 Mexico surpassed France to become the 9th largest holder of US debt. The commercial and financial dependence on the US is a cause for concern. The remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United States account for 0.2% of Mexico's GDP which was equal to US$20 billion per year in 2004 and is the tenth largest source of foreign income after oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.

Eisner declined but recommended Harlan Ellison, who wrote a two-hour live-action script for the filmmaker. Friedkin and Ellison afterward had an unrelated argument, and the project was abandoned. During the 1980s, Brad Bird, Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz attempted to get an animated adaptation off the ground, though studio executives praised the screenplay, they thought the film would be unmarketable, and this version was scrapped. In the early 1990s, producer Michael Uslan and executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Steven Maier subsequently obtained the rights for a live-action film adaptation. The producer promised Eisner that he would not permit anyone who \"didn't get it\" to work on the project. Two ideas pitched to Uslan were to put the Spirit in a costume and to have the Spirit be a resurrected dead man who possessed supernatural powers. Screenwriter John Turman, a comic book fan, expressed interest in writing the script. In July 2004, financier OddLot Entertainment acquired the rights to the film. OddLot's producers Gigi Pritzker and Deborah Del Prete began a collaboration with Uslan, Melniker, and Maier working at Batfilm Productions, to adapt the story. Eisner, who was protective of the rights to his creations, said that he believed in the producers to faithfully adapt The Spirit. In April 2005, comic-book writer Jeph Loeb was hired to adapt The Spirit for the big screen, but the writer eventually left the project. Later in April, Uslan approached Frank Miller at Will Eisner's memorial service in New York City several weeks after Miller's Sin City was released in theaters, interested in initiating the adaptation technique with Miller's film for The Spirit.  Miller had initially hesitated, doubting his skill in adapting The Spirit, but ultimately embraced his first solo project as writer-director. Miller described his decision-making: In July 2006, the film trade press reported Miller would write and direct the film adaptation for The Spirit\u2009; Miller and the producers publicly announced this at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Miller said that he was putting together a film treatment that included large parts of The Spirit strip panels. As Miller described the project, \"I intend to be extremely faithful to the heart and soul of the material, but it won't be nostalgic. It will be much scarier than people expect\". Miller filmed The Spirit using the same digital background technology that was used for Sin City and 300. The film would also copy specific shots from the comic, similar to Sin City. In February 2007, Miller completed the first draft of the screenplay and began work on a second draft.  Principal photography was initially slated to begin in late spring 2007.  Miller also planned to begin filming Sin City 2 in spring 2009, and Uslan indicated that filming for The Spirit would begin before Miller started Sin City 2. Following the casting of Gabriel Macht as the Spirit in August 2007, filming was re-slated for the following October.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While recording with Spears over the years, Karlsson and Winnberg often saw first-hand how her regular activities were interrupted by the paparazzi, including one experience in Hamburg which Winnberg deemed \"really scary\". For Blackout, Spears worked with them on \"Radar\", \"Freakshow\" and \"Toy Soldier\". When the album was considered to be finished, Bloodshy & Avant were persuaded by her A&R Teresa LaBarbera Whites to work on a new track. Winnberg commented that it had always been an unwritten rule not to write songs about Spears's personal life since the label rejected \"Sweet Dreams My LA Ex\", a response track to Justin Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River\". However, the duo wrote \"Piece of Me\" with \u00c5hlund and sent it to Spears, who loved it. Bloodshy & Avant worked on the track at Bloodshy & Avant Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and Spears recorded her vocals at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Winnberg stated that Spears was extremely psyched when she came to the studio, where she recorded the song in about half an hour as she had learned the lyrics by heart in her car. \"Piece of Me\" was later mixed by Niklas Flyckt at Mandarine Studios in Stockholm. On October 31, 2007, during a radio interview with Ryan Seacrest, Spears talked about the song, saying, \"Wherever you go, there's a lot of people who ask questions, and sometimes you don't know their intentions and stuff like that.

Bruce McDaniel was born in Boston, Massachusetts of Mexican and Scottish/American parents on 23 September 1962 and grew up in New York.  He was raised by musical parents who met while attending the Juilliard School of Music.  He had an early start in NYC's underground punk rock scene as lead guitarist for the Sic F*cks with Tish Bellomo and Snooky Bellomo, a band who, despite the inability to have their name said on the radio, parlayed their comedy-punk spectacle to a feature in Playboy Magazine and movie appearances, including 1982's Alone in the Dark. After the dissolution of the late '70s punk scene, McDaniel laid low for much of the '80s, recording jingles and demos. A group of these demos, recorded under the name Life of Riley were picked up by Grammy-award nominated producer Paul Wickliffe, who produced an album's worth of material for the group, only to have the arrangement dissolve under contract disputes. Several of these tracks can be heard on the McDaniel/Gartner collection Ongepotchket. Through the '90s, he served as guitarist and bassist for R&B singer Vaneese Thomas, daughter of soul icon Rufus Thomas, known for her 1987 top 20 hits \"Let's Talk It Over\" and \"Close To You\". McDaniel was ultimately elevated to the role of musical director of her touring band, a job which he still holds. The '90s also saw the formation of McDaniel's band Nine Men's Morris and their first release Monster in My Stomach on Segue Records. McDaniel provided the songs, guitars and lead vocals, and was joined by Gartner on drums and bassist Donald Kyle. The follow-up album, It's a Wonderful Life, was released in 2004 to excellent reviews, with the title cut being featured on MTV's show Made. In 2000, McDaniel extended his musical horizons by composing a ballet, Alice in Wonderland, set on the East Coast Youth Ballet. The ballet was performed in 2001 and 2002 at the Rich Forum and Palace Theater in Stamford, Connecticut to sold-out houses and rave reviews.

The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind and Daphne Honeybutt . One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File was released in 1965. The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin , the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn , while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films. Following the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond\u00a0... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere. The 24 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 26 Bond films have grossed over $7.04\u00a0billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\". Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart. Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps.

One strategy, often called the 'shipping strategy', is to attempt a high level of goods production, and to ship those goods back to the homeland for points. Corn is produced free and indigo has a low investment cost, therefore these goods are commonly chosen when this strategy is used because all exports are valued the same. The major disadvantage of this strategy is that doubloons are harder to acquire, and thus buildings are harder to build. The other major strategy is to produce crops that are worth more , and to use the cash produced from selling/trading to buy more buildings that also give new abilities. Expensive buildings can give a player many victory points, but fewer goods are likely to be shipped to the homeland, and so the VPs from exports can be expected to be low.

{"id": "164_1444", "question": "Who was the producer of Innocence?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_5670", "text": "When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter, died on 13 July 1205, John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III that would lead to the King's excommunication. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the Church being \"governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre\" and established \"its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler\", in the words of historian Richard Huscroft. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English Church, albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome. These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. Pope Innocent was, according to historian Ralph Turner, an \"ambitious and aggressive\" religious leader, insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church. John wanted John de Gray, the Bishop of Norwich and one of his own supporters, to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral claimed the exclusive right to elect the Archbishop. They favoured Reginald, the chapter's sub-prior. To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop. The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent. John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de Gray, and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision. Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray, and instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton. John refused Innocent's request that he consent to Langton's appointment, but the Pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207. John was incensed about what he perceived as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election. He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole. He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place to try to convince John to change his mind, but to no avail. Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and confessions and absolutions for the dying. John treated the interdict as \"the equivalent of a papal declaration of war\". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, releasing them only after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the King in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy, this did not appear to worry the King greatly. Two of John's close allies, Emperor Otto IV and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, had already suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued. John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks to John. Official figures suggest that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year. Innocent gave some dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic communities were allowed to celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England. Under mounting political pressure, John finally negotiated terms for a reconciliation, and the papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks annually: 700 marks for England and 300 marks for Ireland, as well as recompensing the Church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the , or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the compensation money he had promised the Church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship. Failure in France and the First Barons' War Tensions and discontent Tensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years, as demonstrated by the 1212 plot against the King. Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as \"the Northerners\". The northern barons rarely had any personal stake in the conflict in France, and many of them owed large sums of money to John; the revolt has been characterised as \"a rebellion of the king's debtors\". Many of John's military household joined the rebels, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England; their local links and loyalties outweighed their personal loyalty to John. Tension also grew across North Wales, where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict. For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was an important factor, as he was considered an \"abrasive foreigner\" by many of the barons. The failure of John's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw that precipitated the baronial uprising during John's final years as king; James Holt describes the path to civil war as \"direct, short and unavoidable\" following the defeat at Bouvines.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The 1971 film takes place in Central Park in New York City and follows a documentary entitled Over the Cliff, one supposedly directed by Greaves himself and focusing on different pairs of actors who prepare to audition for a dramatic piece. Greaves employed three sets of camera crews to document this audition process. The first crew focuses on the actors in an effort to document the audition process. The second documents the first film crew. The third documents the actors, the remaining two crews, and any other passers-by or spectators who happen to fit into Over the Cliff'''s overarching theme of \"sexuality.\" As the film goes on, the various film crews start to grow irritated, as they come to perceive that Greaves is an incompetent and sexist director. Divided about whether or not this entire situation is a plot by Greaves, the crews find themselves divided against him, at one point even plotting a revolt against their director. All of their doubts, insecurities, and complaints are captured on film, and, when the project is complete, they turn all of their footage over to Greaves . Greaves, in turn, incorporates their footage into his final product. Through all of this, Greaves creates a giant circular meta-documentary featuring a documentary, a documentary about a documentary, and a documentary documenting a documentary about a documentary, and all in an attempt to create and capture reality on film. To add to the coherence or incoherence of the piece, the film is also edited untraditionally, with the different cameras' various shots intercut in split screens so that all three sets of simultaneous footage display the same sequence but from three perspectives.Symbiopsychotaxiplasm was unable to find mainstream distribution and instead toured various festivals and museum screenings, gaining something of a cult status amongst those filmmakers who had seen it. It eventually caught the eye of famous actor and filmmaker Steve Buscemi who saw it at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992.

Winslet was originally cast as Hanna, but scheduling difficulties with Revolutionary Road led her to leave the film and Nicole Kidman was cast as her replacement. In January 2008, Kidman left the project, citing her recent pregnancy as the primary reason. She had not filmed any scenes yet, so the studio was able to recast Winslet without affecting the production schedule. Filming took place in Berlin, G\u00f6rlitz, on the Kirnitzschtal tramway near Bad Schandau, and finished in the MMC Studios K\u00f6ln in Cologne on July 14. Filmmakers received $718,752 from Germany's Federal Film Board.  Overall, the studio received $4.1 million from Germany's regional and federal subsidiaries. Schlink insisted the film be shot in English rather than German, as it posed questions about living in a post-genocide society that went beyond mid-century Germany. Daldry and Hare toured locations from the novel with Schlink, viewed documentaries about that period in German history, and read books and articles about women who had served as SS guards in the camps. Hare, who rejected using a voiceover narration to render the long internal monologues in the novel, also changed the ending so that Michael starts to tell the story of Hanna and him to his daughter. \"It's about literature as a powerful means of communication, and at other times as a substitute for communication\", he explained. The filming of sex scenes with Kross and Winslet were delayed until Kross turned 18. The primary cast, all of whom were German besides Fiennes, Olin, and Winslet, decided to emulate Kross's accent since he had just learned English for the film. Chris Menges replaced Roger Deakins as cinematographer. One of the film's producers, Scott Rudin, left the production over a dispute about the rushed editing process to ensure a 2008 release date and had his name removed from the credit list. Rudin differed with Harvey Weinstein \"because he didn't want to campaign for an Oscar along with Doubt and Revolutionary Road, which also stars Winslet.\" Winslet won the Best Actress Academy Award for The Reader. Marc Caro wrote, \"Because Winslet couldn't get Best Actress nominations for both movies, the Weinstein Co. shifted her to supporting actress for The Reader as a courtesy...\" but that it is \"...up to [the voters] to place the name in the category that they think is appropriate to the performance\", resulting in her receiving more Best Actress nomination votes for this film than the Best Actress submission of her Revolutionary Road performance. Winslet's head-to-head performances also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for Revolutionary Road and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Reader. Entertainment Weekly reported that to \"age Hanna from cool seductress to imprisoned war criminal, Winslet endured seven and a half hours of makeup and prosthetic prep each day.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly writes that \"Ralph Fiennes has perhaps the toughest job, playing the morose adult Michael\u00a0\u2013 a version, we can assume, of the author.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Roland Emmerich delivers his trademark visual and emotional bombast, but the more Anonymous stops and tries to convince the audience of its half-baked theory, the less convincing it becomes.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Rex Reed regards Anonymous as \"one of the most exciting on-screen literary rows since Norman Mailer was beaten with a hammer\", and well worth the stamina required to sit out what is an otherwise exhausting film. Not only Shakespeare's identity, but also that of Queen Elizabeth, the \"Virgin Queen\" is challenged by Orloff's script, which has her as \"a randy piece of work who had many lovers and bore several children.\" Visually, the film gives us a \"dazzling panorama of Tudor history\" which will not bore viewers. It boasts a cast of pure gold, and its \"recreation of the Old Globe, the fame that brought ruin and dishonour to both Oxford and the money-grubbing Shakespeare, and the sacrifice of Oxford's own property and family fortune to write plays he believed in against a background of danger and violence make for a bloody good yarn, masterfully told, lushly appointed, slavishly researched and brilliantly acted.\" He adds the caveats that it does play \"hopscotch with history\", has a bewildering and confusing cast of characters and is jumpy in its timeframes. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune writes that the film is ridiculous but not dull. Displaying a \"rollicking belief in its own nutty bombast\" as \"history is simultaneously being made up and rewritten\", its best scenes are those of the candle-lit interiors caught by the Alexa digital camera on a lovely copper-and-honey-toned palette. After a week, what remains in Phillips' memory is not the de Vere/Shakespeare conspiracy theory but \"the way Redgrave gazes out a window, her reign near the end, her eyes full of regret but also of fiery defiance of the balderdash lapping at her feet.\" Roger Ebert finds Orloff's screenplay \"ingenious\", Emmerich's direction \"precise\", and the cast \"memorable\". Though \"profoundly mistaken\", Anonymous is \"a marvellous historical film\", giving viewers \"a splendid experience: the dialogue, the acting, the depiction of London, the lust, jealousy and intrigue.\" However, Emmerich must \"tiresomely insist that Edward de Vere did not write Shakespeare's plays.\" Kirk Honeycutt ranked it as Emmerich's best film, with a superb cast of British actors, and a stunning digitally-enhanced recreation of London in Elizabethan times. The film is \"glorious fun as it grows increasingly implausible\", for the plot \"is all historical rubbish\". Damon Wise, reviewing the film for The Guardian, appraises Emmerich's \"meticulously crafted\" and \"stunningly designed takedown of the Bard\", as shocking only in that it is rather good. Emmerich's problem, he argues, is that he was so intent on proving his credentials as a serious director that the film ended up \"drowned in exposition\". Orloff's screenplay heavily confuses plotlines; the politics are retrofitted to suit the theory. The lead roles are \"unengaging\" but special mention is given to Edward Hogg's performance as Robert Cecil, and Vanessa Redgrave's role as Elizabeth. Robert Koehler of Variety reads the film as an \"illustrated argument\" of an \"aggressively promoted and more frequently debunked\" theory, and finds it less interesting than the actors who play a role in, or endorse, it. Narrative cogency is strained by the constant switches in time signature, and the imbroglio of Shakespeare and Jonson squabbling publicly over claims to authorship is both tiresome and \"veers close to comedy\"; indeed it is superfluous given Ifans's commanding and convincing acting as the \"real\" Shakespeare. The supporting cast of actors is praised for fine performances, except for Spall's Shakespeare, who is \"often so ridiculous that the 'Stratfordians' will feel doubly insulted.\" Sebastian Krawinkel's \"ambitious and gorgeous production design\" comes in for special mention, as does Anna J. Foerster's elegant widescreen lensing. The score, however, fails their standards. Kristopher Tapley champions the film, finding that Orloff has spun \"a fascinating yarn\". Ifans gives a stunning performance, and Spall's Shakespeare provides delightful comic relief. The film is \"gorgeous\" and Tapley agrees with a colleague's judgement that \"people will likely look back to Anonymous as the tipping point of what you can really do with digital in a next-level kind of way\". David Denby of The New Yorker writes of Emmerich's \"preposterous fantasia\", where confusion reigns as to which of the virgin queen's illegitimate children is Essex and which Southampton, and where it is not clear what the connection is between the plot to hide the authorship of the plays and the struggle to find a successor to the officially childless Elizabeth. He concludes that, \"The Oxford theory is ridiculous, yet the filmmakers go all the way with it, producing endless scenes of indecipherable court intrigue in dark, smoky rooms, and a fashion show of ruffs, farthingales, and halberds. The more far-fetched the idea, it seems, the more strenuous the effort to pass it off as authentic.\" James Lileks of Star Tribune, noting favourable responses, including one where a critic wondered if Emmerich had anything to do with it, says the devious message must be that a shlock-merchant like Emmerich wasn't involved, but, like the film plot itself, must conceal the hand of some more experienced filmmaker, whose identity will be much debated for centuries to come. Reviewing for Associated Press, Christy Lemire commends Rhys Ifans' performance as \"flamboyant, funny, sexy\" in an otherwise heavy-handed and clumsy film, whose script \"jumps back and forth in time so quickly and without rhyme or reason, it convolutes the narrative.\" A \"flow chart\" is perhaps needed to keep track of all of the sons, and sons of sons. The \"blubbering\" about the brilliance of Shakespeare's works is repetitive, and upstages the initial whiff of scandal, giving the impression that the film is \"much ado about nothing\". A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that Anonymous is \"a vulgar prank on the English literary tradition, a travesty of British history and a brutal insult to the human imagination\". Yet, a fine cast manages to \"burnish even meretricious nonsense with craft and conviction\", and one is \"tempted to suspend disbelief, even if Mr. Emmerich finally makes it impossible.\" Lou Lumenick, writing for the New York Post, writes that the movie \"is a thoroughly entertaining load of eye candy with solid performances, even if John Orloff's exposition-heavy script practically requires a concordance to follow at times.\" For The Globe and Mails Liam Lacey, \"the less you know about Shakespeare, the more you're likely to enjoy Anonymous.\" Ingenuity is wasted on an \"unintelligent enterprise\", that of arguing that people of humble origins cannot outwrite blue-bloods. Emmerich's CGI effects are well-done, but it is amazing just to watch an \"actor on a bare wooden stage, using nothing but a sequence of words that make your scalp prickle.\" Andrea Chase in Killer Movie Reviews rates Anonymous as \"superb\", dwelling on Orloff's rich script, which has \"done an excellent job of fitting the known facts to the thesis on offer\", on Emmerich's dramatic flair and the wonderful supporting cast. It is somewhat spoiled by Ifans's leaden presence, which betrays nothing of \"the ribald temper to be found in the plays.\" By contrast, Spall's Shakespeare, \"preening with the narcissist's elan of a confirmed ham, lights up the screen.\" Louise Keller for Urban Cinefile admires the \"thought-provoking scenario\" of Orloff's \"marvellous conspiracy story\", though its \"twists and turns\" are headspinning: \"anyone who can follow the first 30 minutes of the plot, must have been polishing the grey matter with advanced Sudoku: it's an unholy mess of complicated situations and jumps in time frame.\" Despite the exemplary cast, exquisite production design and extraordinary look, Emmerich has lost an opportunity to make more of it, \"on account of the jumbled, convoluted storyline that had me confused, frustrated and mentally scrambling to keep abreast of every detail\", though everything falls together in the final 45 minutes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element. At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to \"powder her nose\"\u00a0\u2013 literally; she snorts coke in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth. As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom\u00a0\u2013 his actions will lead to Jules' transformative \"moment of clarity\". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel. When the diner hold-up turns into a Mexican standoff, \"Honey Bunny\" whines, \"I gotta go pee!\" As described by Peter and Will Brooker, \"In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.\" The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance: Vincent and Jules's diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet. While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus's wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses. During a stakeout at Butch's apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch. In the Brookers' analysis, \"Through Vince\u00a0... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.\" Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading Modesty Blaise in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as \"the archetypal consumers of pulp\": Locating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of \"pulp\" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations\u00a0\u2013 pulp, women, shit\u00a0\u2013 that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub. Willis reads Pulp Fiction in almost precisely the opposite direction, finding \"its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one's childhood, as is Tarantino's wont as well as his stated aim.\" Despite that, argues Fraiman, \"Pulp Fiction demonstrates\u00a0... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is one of only three Brazilian states which together produce the world's entire supply of carnauba wax. Share of the Brazilian economy: 2,04% . According to the data from IPECE and IBGE, the GDP growth of the State of Cear\u00e1 in 2014 was of 4.36%, while Brazil's overall GDP grew only 0.1% in the same year. Traditionally an agriculture-based state, Cear\u00e1 began an industrialisation program under the military regime , and the industrial sector continues to expand annually. In 1999, industry accounted for 39.3% of the state's GDP. Tourism also plays a large role in Cear\u00e1's economy, with the state's many waterfalls, beaches and rainforests. On average, Fortaleza alone receives half a million tourists annually. In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of cashew nuts, coconut, papaya, melon and beans. The production of cashew in Brazil is carried out almost exclusively in the Northeast. The area occupied by cashew trees in Brazil in 2017 was estimated at 505,500 ha; of this total, 99.5% is located in the Northeast. The main producers in this region are Cear\u00e1 , Rio Grande do Norte and Piau\u00ed. However, Brazil, which in 2011 was the fifth largest world producer of cashew nuts, in 2016, fell to 14th position, with 1.5% of the total volume of nuts produced in the world. Vietnam, Nigeria, India and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were the world's largest cashew nut producers in 2016, with 70.6% of global production. In recent years, there has been increased competition with some African countries, where government programs have driven the expansion of culture and processing capacity. It is estimated that at 295 thousand tons per year the installed capacity for processing cashew nuts in the Northeast, however, the Region only managed to produce around a quarter of that quantity. Among the main world producers, Brazil has the lowest productivity. Several factors are pointed out as the cause of the low productivity and the fall in the Brazilian production of cashew nuts. One reason is that most orchards are in a phase of natural decline in production. In addition, the giant cashew trees, which are the majority in the Region, are exploited in an almost extractive manner, with low use of technology. In 2017, the Northeast Region was the largest producer of coconut in the country, with 74.0% of national production. Bahia produced 351 million fruits, Sergipe, 234 million, and Cear\u00e1 187 million. However, the sector has been suffering strong competition and losing market to Indonesia, the Philippines and India, the world's largest producers, who even export coconut water to Brazil. In addition to climatic problems, the low productivity of coconut palms in the Northeast Region is the result of factors related to the variety of coconut harvested and the technological level used in coastal regions. In these areas, the semi-extractive cultivation system still prevails, with low fertility and without the adoption of cultural management practices. The three states that have the largest production, Bahia, Sergipe and Cear\u00e1, present a yield three times lower than that of Pernambuco, which is in 5th place in the national production. This is because most of the coconut trees in these three states are located in coastal areas and cultivated in semi-extractivist systems. In 2018, the South Region was the main producer of beans with 26.4% of the total, followed by the Midwest , Southeast Region , Northeast and North . The largest producers in the Northeast were Cear\u00e1 and Bahia. In cassava production, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. Maranh\u00e3o was the 7th largest producer in the country, with 681 thousand tons. Cear\u00e1 was 9th, with 622 thousand tons. In total, the northeast produced 3,5 million tons. Rio Grande do Norte is the largest producer of melon in the country. In 2017 it produced 354 thousand tons. The Northeast region accounted for 95.8% of the country's production in 2007. In addition to Rio Grande do Norte, which in 2005 produced 45.4% of the country's total, the other 3 largest in the country were Cear\u00e1, Bahia and Pernambuco. In the production of papaya, in 2018 Bahia was the 2nd largest producer state in Brazil, almost equaling with Esp\u00edrito Santo. Cear\u00e1 was in 3rd place and Rio Grande do Norte in 4th place. In the production of banana, in 2018 Cear\u00e1 was the 8th largest national producer, with 408 thousand tons. The state stands out nationally in raising goats and sheep. In 2016, Cear\u00e1 had the fourth largest herd of goats in the country, with 1.13 million heads. The state occupied the same position in the herd of sheep, with 2.31 million animals. Cear\u00e1's cattle herd is small compared to other states in Brazil. In 2019, it had 2.4 million heads. Milk production was 705 million liters this year. In 2017, the Northeast was the largest shrimp producer in the country. National production was 41 thousand tons. Rio Grande do Norte and Cear\u00e1 were the largest producers. Aracati, in Ceara, was the municipality with the highest participation. About industry, Cear\u00e1 had in 2017 an industrial GDP of R$ 22.2 billion, equivalent to 1.9% of the national industry. It employs 296,734 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Construction , Industrial Public Utility Services, such as Electricity and Water , Food , Leather and footwear and Clothing . These 5 sectors concentrate 75.7% of the state's industry. The main sectors of the Cear\u00e1 industry are clothing, food, metallurgy, textiles, chemicals and footwear. Most of the industries are installed in the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza, where the Industrial District of Maracana\u00fa is located. In S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Amarante, a steel mill is installed, Companhia Sider\u00fargica do Pec\u00e9m, which in 2018 produced 2.9 million tons of crude steel, of the 35.4 million produced in the country.

Parodies and pastiches of it have continued decades after it airs, such as Only Fools and Horses Christmas episode Miami Twice and Moonbeam City . The video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, published by Rockstar Games in 2002, is heavily inspired by Miami Vice in multiple ways. It is set in a stylized 1980s Miami inspired fictional city named \"Vice City\". One of the main characters, Lance Vance, was actually voiced by Philip Michael Thomas. Two undercover police officers appear in a police sports car within the game when the player obtains a three-star wanted level. The two officers, one white and one black, resemble the two leading characters of Miami Vice. In the prequel, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, there are two officers in the multiplayer mode named Cracker and Butts, a parody of Crockett and Tubbs; these characters share the same role as the undercover cops in Vice City. Many of the fashion styles and trends popularized by the TV show, such as fast cars and speed boats, unshaven beard stubble, a T-shirt under pastel suits, no socks, rolled up sleeves, boat shoes and Ray Ban sunglasses symbolize the stereotypical image of 1980s fashion and culture. The show also had a lasting impact on Miami itself. It drew a large amount of media attention to the beginning revitalization of the South Beach and Art Deco District areas of Miami Beach, as well as other portions of Greater Miami, and increases tourism and investment. Even 30 years after Miami Vice first airs, it is still responsible for its share of tourist visits to the city.

At the time, the mention of homosexuality on stage was illegal in New York State, but authorities chose to overlook the play's subject matter when its Broadway production was acclaimed by critics. Because the Hays Code, which was in effect when the film was produced, would never permit a film to focus on or even hint at lesbianism, Samuel Goldwyn was the only producer interested in purchasing the film rights to the play.

Although Wyler wasn't completely happy with Goldwyn's casting choices, he accepted the offer, though he insisted on a three-year contract instead. He tried to convince Goldwyn to replace contract player Joel McCrea with Leslie Howard, but the producer refused and, unwisely, told McCrea about Wyler's preference, which led to difficulties between the actor and director during filming. The Lux Radio Theatre aired a one-hour adaptation of the film on December 6, 1937, with Barbara Stanwyck as Martha Dobie, Errol Flynn as Dr. Joe Cardin, Mary Astor as Karen Wright, and Constance Collier as Lily Mortar.

A 1966 letter from Gloag to Clayton suggests that 20th Century Fox was interested in producing a film adaptation and that Eleanor Perry had written a script, but it was acquired for Clayton by MGM and Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff. Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\". Richard Burton was the first choice to play Charlie, but it was thought that his fee would push the budget too high, so Bogarde was cast in the role. The juvenile cast was led by Pamela Franklin, who had worked with Clayton in The Innocents. Yootha Joyce had worked with Clayton in an acclaimed cameo role in Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . Our Mother's House is the second in a loose trilogy of films in which Clayton explored themes of the occult and of children in isolated situations who are threatened by evil. He most famously essayed these subjects in The Innocents, his acclaimed adaptation of Henry James' \"The Turn of the Screw\", and he returned to it in the 1980s with his screen adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes . In his 1975 memoir, Dirk Bogarde recounted his experience with the production in glowing terms: \"On my first morning in the gloomy house in Croydon I was in a bit of a funk. Eight pairs of eyes, ranging from five to fourteen, gazed at me solemnly. Not a smile, no welcoming grin even. In the little caravan in the scrubby front garden which I had been given to change in there was a jam jar stuffed with privet and some wilting Michaelmas daisies. Under it was a note. 'Let's hope you're as good as you're cracked up to be. You'd better be. Sincerely, The Children.' \"I loved every second of the film, which was one of the happiest I have ever made.\" Our Mother's House was also the second of five collaborations between Clayton and noted French composer Georges Delerue, who had written the score for Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater . 16 years after making Our Mother's House, Clayton and Delerue reunited for Something Wicked This Way Comes , but that production was troubled, with the studio forcing Clayton to replace Delerue's original music with a new score by James Horner. Delerue composed the music for Clayton's last two projects: The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne and the TV movie Memento Mori .", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was produced by Village Roadshow Pictures, Media Magik Entertainment and Malpaso Productions for film distributor Warner Bros. Eastwood co-produced with his Malpaso partners Robert Lorenz and Bill Gerber. Eastwood  has stated he enjoyed the idea \"that it dealt with prejudice, that it was about never being too old to learn\". Shooting began in July 2008. Hmong crew, production assistants, consultants, and extras were used. The film was shot over five weeks. Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach, the editors, cut the film so it was under two hours long. The crew spent over $10 million while shooting the film in Detroit. In the early 1990s, Schenk became acquainted with the history and culture of the Hmong while working in a factory in Minnesota. He also learned how they had sided with the South Vietnamese forces and its US allies during the Vietnam War, only to wind up in refugee camps, at the mercy of North Vietnamese Communist forces, when US troops pulled out and the government forces were defeated. Years later, he was deciding how to develop a story involving a widowed Korean War veteran trying to handle the changes in his neighborhood when he decided to place a Hmong family next door and create a culture clash. He and Dave Johannson, Schenk's brother's roommate, created an outline for the story. According to Schenk, each night he used a pen and paper to write the script while in Grumpy's, a bar in Northeast Minneapolis, while not working at his day jobs. He recalled writing 25 pages within a single night in the bar. He recalled asking the bartender, who was his friend, questions about the story's progress. Some industry insiders told Schenk that a film starring an elderly main character could not be produced, as the story could not be sold,  especially with an elderly main character who used language suggesting that he held racist views. Through a friend, Schenk sent the screenplay to Warner Bros. producer Bill Gerber. Eastwood was able to direct and star on the project as filming for Invictus was delayed to early 2009, leaving sufficient time for filming Gran Torino during the previous summer. Eastwood said that he had a \"fun and challenging role, and it's an oddball story.\" According to Schenk, aside from changing Minneapolis references to Detroit references, the production headed by Eastwood \"didn't change a single syllable\" in the script. Schenk added that the concept of the producers not making any substantial revisions to a submitted script \"never happens.\" Eastwood said that he stopped making significant revisions after attempting to change the script of Unforgiven and later deciding to return to the original revision, believing that his changes were \"emasculating\" the product.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In order to receive Kubrick's approval to re-adapt The Shining into a program closer to the original story, King had to agree in writing to eschew his frequent public criticism of Kubrick's film, save for the sole commentary that he was disappointed with Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance as though he had been insane before his arrival at the Overlook Hotel. ABC's success with previous miniseries adaptations of King's work, such as It , The Tommyknockers , and The Stand , made them more than willing to offer the author to work on the screenplay for The Shining miniseries with small Broadcast Standards and Practices enforced. The casting team had a very difficult time finding an actor for the role of Jack Torrance as most of the considerations who rejected the role worried about being compared to Nicholson's performance in the Kubrick version. Two of the many actors considered included Tim Daly and Gary Sinise. King got very impatient, threatening to \"wait another 18 years\" if the role for Jack Torrance wasn't booked. Finally, via a suggestion from Rebecca De Mornay, Weber was chosen for the role four days before filming began. Weber accepted the offer because he was a fan of the Mick Garris-directed miniseries for The Stand and found the script he read to be \"multi-layered\" and relatable. King was the one who chose De Mornay for the role of Wendy. The producers approached her in 1994, and she accepted the role, enjoying the script for being \"creepier, more disturbing, and more entertaining,\" and closer to the novel than the Kubrick version.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mack became friends while all three were working on individual small press projects. Bendis says that he also began to \"analyz[e] why it was that I [had] never attempted to write a superhero comic\" at the time, while he was writing crime books such as Jinx and Goldfish, despite his love of the genre. Concluding that Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen had sufficiently explored the genre, Bendis decided to work in other genres. The series' concept was derived from his love of crime fiction and police procedurals in general, as well as specific works such as Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, Janis Joplin's biography, Taxi Driver, T-Men, Traffic and Visions Of Light: The Art of Cinematography, and would take the form of a Behind the Music-type look at superheroes. Powers, Oeming says, is \"a superhero universe seen through the eyes of the police... [as] observed by the media\" and everyday individuals. Bendis' intention was to view the \"cliches of the superhero genre through the harder eyes of the cops\", but with the added layer that \"every arc has some footing in a famous rock star story\". Bendis' scripts are often compiled from \"a list of scenes\", eschewing \"the big exploding ending\" in favor of a \"character-driven or psychological ending\". Indeed, in experimenting with plots, the duo swiftly moved beyond 'mere' police procedurals , constantly pushing each other creatively in new ways. In conceiving plots for the series, Bendis emphasizes the purpose and themes in the narrative over \"just being cool\", and allowing the theme to dictate the direction of the story. Bendis would collaborate with Oeming, who had already expressed interest in producing a crime/noir comic with Bendis, inspired by his attempts to get work on Batman Adventures to do a book in a style reminiscent of Bruce Timm and Alex Toth. Bendis cites two images produced by Oeming as originating the then-experimental \"Powers' style\" and \"inspir[ing] everything in [Powers]\". Indeed, Bendis and Oeming's first collaboration was \"Mall Outing\" in Jinx: True Crime Confessions. It is included in Little Deaths \"for Powers completists and curiosity's sake\". Oeming has noted that, although seen as an overtly \"cartoony\" style, the artwork does not appeal to children, which helps sidestep the potential problem of the book, which contains mature content, being purchased by customers younger than its intended audience. Despite both creators only having produced work in black and white before Powers, Bendis envisioned Powers in color, and convinced Oeming that it could work, despite the dramatically higher number of sales required to sustain a color comic. Bendis also convinced Oeming that the book should juxtapose both the superhero and crime noir genres, as Oeming initially shied away from the former. Bendis writes in the 'Sketchbook' section of the Powers: Who Killed Retro Girl? TPB that \"one of the rules of film noir is that the city itself should be considered a lead character\". To this end, he made Oeming watch Visions of Light, a documentary by the American Cinematographers Institute about the art of lighting in film, which he saw as important to the feel of comics also. According to Oeming, both he and Bendis do copious research for their projects, and that before he began the series, he would do ride-alongs with police, meet police officials, and take extensive photo reference of their equipment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While promoting that episode, Lindelof said that it uses the flashback device \"in a way we never have before and never will again\" and while promoting \"The Constant\", he said that it \"upholds that pledge, unpledges it, then repledges it.\" Losts writer-producers enjoy science fiction themes such as time travel; however, they were careful not to create a paradox. The rules for time-travel in the series are outlined in \"Flashes Before Your Eyes\"\u2014although, Lindelof has said that \"The Constant\" is a more important episode in terms of explaining time travel on the show\u2014by Ms. Hawking , who explains that certain events are inevitable and the universe will eventually correct any errors. Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. The writers hoped that \"The Constant\" would further establish that there are no parallel universes or alternate realities. Lindelof reminisced that \"just breaking that episode was such a massive headache\" and Cuse added that \"it was definitely like doing the hardest New York Times crossword puzzle for the week\". Cuse and Lindelof admitted they took some inspiration from the final episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, \"All Good Things...\", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as \"someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist\". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction\u2014as Lindelof put it, \"He's our Doc Brown here, who basically is gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past\". Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, \"The Constant\" took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories. Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Lost's rules. Michio Kaku claimed that \"the show's producers did their homework\". According to Kaku, \"there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel\u2014just a lack of know-how\u00a0\u2026\u00a0[but] it would take a very advanced civilization to really do this\". Cuse stated that \"we [the writers] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility\". \"The Constant\" was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information\u2014Lindelof has declared that \"you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were in a constant state of crisis\". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew. Shooting occurred in the second half of October 2007. The scenes on the freighter in this and later episodes were filmed for several days on a freighter ten to fifteen minutes off the west coast of Oahu, Hawaii, where Lost is filmed. Instead of docking the ship and returning to the ocean each day, the actors and crew slept on the freighter in areas that were not being used for filming. The Oxford scenes were shot at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu. In 1996, Desmond has short hair and no facial hair and in 2004, Desmond sports long and untamed hair with a full beard. Cusick did not cut his hair; it was hidden underneath a short-haired wig by \"really talented hair and makeup folks\", according to Carlton Cuse. All freighter scenes were shot before Cusick shaved most of his beard for the 1996 scenes. A fake beard was glued onto Cusick for the episodes \"Ji Yeon\" and \"Meet Kevin Johnson\" while his beard grew back. The equations on Faraday's chalkboard were written by a physicist who was hired as a consultant by the producers. The way the transitions between the 1996 and 2004 scenes would take place was frequently discussed during production. The producers took the advice of editor Mark Goldman, who suggested sudden cuts with \"no fancy effect, and in some cases, no sound cut\", similar to the way \"All Good Things...\" was edited. The original ending would set up the following episode by having Charlotte drop a bag containing a gas mask at Faraday's feet. But the producers thought it did not work after the emotional scenes between Desmond and Penny, and decided to finish with Faraday reading his diary. Jeremy Davies, who plays Daniel Faraday, said \"I thought it was a remarkably well-written and brilliantly conceived story.

One of the stories involved monsters that came from a movie theatre screen and attacked the audience, a story that Bava liked more than the other two and began developing it into a feature film. Dardano and Bava took their 25-page treatment for the film to producer Fabrizio De Angelis, who wanted to use footage from Lucio Fulci's films as the film within a film to cut costs. The two would also take the treatment to Luciano Martino who suggested the two to produce the film themselves.  Meanwhile, Dario Argento, who was fresh from the financial success of Phenomena and was beginning to be interested in producing films as he had done previously with Dawn of the Dead. Argento began looking for films to produce, first reading a science fiction script from Luigi Cozzi which he was not convinced with, and then meeting with Bava who agreed to produce Demons. Sacchetti was not content with Argento's suggestions for the script, later stating that Argento brought in Franco Ferrini who he felt only tried to please Argento. Ferrini stated his contributions to the script was to post-pone the appearance of the demons, which he said originally appeared much earlier in the film. Sacchetti then said Argento paid him and had him leave the project, only to invite him back towards the end to give the script a final polish. Sacchetti later remarked that the first half of the film's story was the same as the original script while the second half had more blood and gore and special effect scenes.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "164_1488", "question": "Who was the producer of Persuasion?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_47252", "text": "The filming of Persuasion coincided with a sudden resurgence of Jane Austen adaptations, as it was one of six such productions released during the mid-1990s. The media dubbed the phenomenon \"Austenmania\". While it was common for a successful adaptation to lead to the production of others, this surge in Austen's popularity involved many simultaneous projects\u2014Persuasions production, for instance, coincided with the TV serial Pride and Prejudice and the feature film Sense and Sensibility. Despite the surge, film scholar Andrew Higson and others argue that there is little evidence that the various producers\u2014who were employed by different companies\u2014communicated when conceiving their adaptations. The idea for a film version of the 1817 Austen novel Persuasion began with the English producer Fiona Finlay, who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years. The novel had last been adapted by ITV in a 1971 serial starring Ann Firbank. Finlay felt that the \"very romantic\" story was one \"everyone can relate to. There's something very touching about long-lost love\". She approached the writer Nick Dear about adapting it for television; Finlay had enjoyed his contributions to theatre, particularly his play about William Hogarth, The Art of Success. Dear first suggested they try one of Austen's other works\u2014either Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice\u2014but agreed to adapt Persuasion after reading it. Dear considered the novel\u2014the author's last completed work\u2014a more mature story than the others. Dear later wrote that Persuasion was superficially \"a love story in the Cinderella mould\" but it was also one of \"realism and truthfulness\", particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. He spent two years working on a script, and found this task difficult for several reasons. First, he needed to find a structure that would be faithful to the novel. Second, his protagonist barely spoke for the first half, and \"therefore can't motor the action along as a central character conventionally does\". Adapting Austen's wit was another challenge; much could not be used \"because it's almost all in the author's voice telling us about characters, with a certain wit or lightness that came from the characters themselves. It's a craft job, interpreting the novel for oneself and then finding a film language for it\". An experienced theatre and television serial director, Roger Michell was chosen to direct Persuasion, in what was to be his first feature film. As a young child, Michell had been an admirer of Austen's, which set him apart from his male classmates. \"I was the only boy in my class who took Austen as a special paper\", he said. His attraction to Persuasion was based on his belief that it was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, as well as her most autobiographical.  He described the work as an \"erotic love story which is full of sexual yearning\". While directing, Michell sought to emphasise contrasts in Austen's story, seen for instance between \"the chilly formality of Kellynch Hall and the warm, wet feel of Uppercross\". The Royal Navy was another point of interest, as officers like Wentworth would often have returned to society wealthy and full of stories. The director wished to depict the integration of cultures, as naval officers came back with \"an informality of behaviour and language which was in marked contrast to what was there before\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The creators of the comic exercised their right to go elsewhere, but this required approval from all divisions of Warner Bros., including television, before it could be approved. After several years, in 2008, Noveck was allowed to take the project to Mark Vahradian at Di Bonaventura Productions. Unusually, this made it the first film from DC not produced by Warner Bros., after the purchase. In June 2008, Summit Entertainment announced plans to adapt Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner's Red. Red was adapted for the big screen by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber, who also wrote the adaptations of Whiteout and Alice. The project was produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura . By April 2009, Bruce Willis was reportedly in discussions with Summit to take the starring role of Frank Moses. It was reported in July 2009 that Morgan Freeman was in talks to co-star alongside Willis in the film. Also in July 2009, Robert Schwentke, the director of The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan, was in negotiations to direct Red. In August 2009, Schwentke confirmed to MTV News that he was on board. He stated that he loved the script, but differences existed between the comic and the movie, stating; \"It's very funny, which the comic book isn't ... It's not as violent as the comic book,\" and  \"The script that I've read is obviously different from the comic, because I don't think the comic gives you enough for a two-hour movie.\" In November 2009, Helen Mirren was reported to be engaged to work alongside Freeman and Willis in the film. Also in November 2009, John C. Reilly and Mary-Louise Parker were in negotiations to join the cast. Reilly would play a retired CIA agent who is paranoid that everyone is out to kill him. Parker would play the romantic interest, a federal pension worker who becomes embroiled in the Willis character's struggle to stay alive. In the same month, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dreyfuss, and Brian Cox entered negotiations to join the cast. In December 2009, creator Warren Ellis stated on his mailing list: \"Read the RED script. Not bad. Not the book, but not bad. Funny. Especially when you know the casting. Very tight piece of work. Talked to the producers last week. They're all kind of giddy over the casting coups. Who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren with a sniper rifle?\" Also in December 2009 Summit Entertainment announced a release date of October 22, 2010. The same month, James Remar was cast in an unspecified role, in addition to Karl Urban as \"Cooper\". In January 2010, reportedly John Malkovich had signed to star opposite Bruce Willis, replacing John C. Reilly, who exited the role in late December. Principal photography began on January 18, 2010, in Toronto, Canada. Red was shot in and around the Toronto metropolitan area for nine weeks before moving on to the road and ending in New Orleans in late March for the final two weeks of principal photography.

Buildings used were the Electricity Board building for the Alpha 60 computer centre and the Hotel Scribe. Constantine came to the film through producer Andr\u00e9 Michelin, who had the actor under contract. Constantine had become a popular actor in France and Germany through his portrayal of tough-guy detective Lemmy Caution in a series of earlier films. Godard appropriated the character for Alphaville but according to director Anne Andreu, Godard's subversion of the Lemmy Caution \"stereotype\" effectively shattered Constantine's connection with the character\u2014he reportedly said that he was shunned by producers after Alphaville was released. Constantine didn't play Lemmy Caution again until Panic Time in 1980. The opening section of the film includes an unedited sequence that depicts Caution walking into his hotel, checking in, riding an elevator and being taken through various corridors to his room. According to cinematographer Raoul Coutard, he and Godard shot this section as a continuous four-minute take. Part of this sequence shows Caution riding an elevator up to his room, which was achieved thanks to the fact that the hotel used as the location had two glass-walled elevators side by side, allowing the camera operator to ride in one lift while filming Constantine riding the other car through the glass between the two. However, as Coutard recalled, this required multiple takes, since the elevators were old and in practice they proved very difficult to synchronize. Like most of Godard's films, the performances and dialogue in Alphaville were substantially improvised. Assistant director Charles Bitsch recalled that, even when production commenced he had no idea what Godard was planning to do. Godard's first act was to ask Bitsch to write a screenplay, saying that producer Michelin had been pestering him for a script because he needed it to help him raise finance from backers in Germany . Bitsch protested that he had never read a Lemmy Caution book, but Godard simply said \"Read one and then write it.\" Bitsch read a Caution book, then wrote a 30-page treatment and brought it to Godard, who said \"OK, fine\" and took it without even looking at it. It was then given to Michelin, who was pleased with the result, and the \"script\" was duly translated into German and sent off to the backers. In fact, none of it even reached the screen and according to Bitsch the German backers later asked Michelin to repay the money when they saw the completed film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Between 1617 and 1619, what was possibly smallpox killed approximately 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans. The first English settlers in Massachusetts, the Pilgrims, arrived on the Mayflower at Plymouth in 1620, and developed friendly relations with the native Wampanoag people. This was the second successful permanent English colony in the part of North America that later became the United States, after the Jamestown Colony. The event, known as the \"First Thanksgiving\", was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World, which lasted for three days. The Pilgrims were soon followed by other Puritans, who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony at present-day Boston in 1630. The Puritans, who believed the Church of England needed to be purified and experienced harassment from English authority because of their beliefs, came to Massachusetts intending to establish an ideal religious society. Unlike the Plymouth colony, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded under a royal charter in 1629. Both religious dissent and expansionism resulted in several new colonies being founded, shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay, elsewhere in New England. The Massachusetts Bay banished dissenters such as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams due to religious and political disagreements. In 1636, Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island, and Hutchinson joined him there several years later. Religious intolerance continued. Among those who objected to this later in the century were the English Quaker preachers Alice and Thomas Curwen, who were publicly flogged and imprisoned in Boston in 1676. In 1641, Massachusetts expanded inland significantly, acquiring the Connecticut River Valley settlement of Springfield, which had recently disputed with, and defected from its original administrators, the Connecticut Colony. This established Massachusetts's southern border in the west, though surveying problems resulted in disputed territory until 1803\u201304. Currency was another issue in the colonies. In 1652 the Massachusetts legislature authorized John Hull to produce coinage . \"The Hull Mint produced several denominations of silver coinage, including the pine tree shilling, for over 30 years until the political and economic situation made operating the mint no longer practical.\" Mostly political for Charles\u00a0II of England deemed the \"Hull Mint\" high treason in the United Kingdom which had a punishment of Hanging, drawing and quartering. \"On April 6, 1681, Randolph petitioned the king, informing him the colony was still pressing their own coins which he saw as high treason and believed it was enough to void the charter. He asked that a writ of Quo warranto be issued against Massachusetts for the violations.\" In 1691, the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth were united into the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Shortly after the arrival of the new province's first governor, William Phips, the Salem witch trials took place, where a number of men and women were hanged for alleged witchcraft. The most destructive earthquake yet known in New England occurred in 1755, causing considerable damage across Massachusetts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The New York Times ran a brief news item mentioning Huie's novel prior to its publication, but never reviewed the novel, although in 1963 Paddy Chayefsky's development of the novel into a screenplay was found worthy of note. A first draft of the screenplay for the film was written by George Goodman, who previously had a success at MGM with The Wheeler Dealers , also with James Garner in the male lead and with the same director and producer. In 1964 a Broadway musical with music written by John Barry was announced. Chayefsky's adaptation, while retaining the title, characters, situation, background and many specific plot incidents, told a very different story. He said, \"I found the book, which is serious in tone, essentially a funny satire, and that's how I'm treating it.\" The screenplay's theme of cowardice as a virtue has no parallel in the novel; in fact, the novel does not mention cowardice at all. The screenplay implies, but never explicitly explains, what is meant by the term \"Americanization.\" The novel uses \"Americanized\" to refer to a woman who accepts, as a normal condition of wartime, the exchange of her sexual favors for gifts of rare wartime commodities. Thus, in reply to the question \"Has Pat been Americanized?\", a character answers: This theme runs throughout the novel. Another character says, \"We operate just like a whorehouse ... except we don't sell it for cash. We swap it for Camels and nylons and steak and eggs and lipstick ... this dress ... came from Saks Fifth Avenue in the diplomatic pouch.\" Emily asks Jimmy, \"Am I behaving like a whore?\" Jimmy replies, \"Whoring is a peacetime activity.\" The screenplay uses Hershey bars to symbolize the luxuries enjoyed by Americans and their \"Americanized\" companions, but the novel uses strawberries. The novel briefly mentions that Emily's mother, Mrs. Barham, has been mentally affected by wartime stress, but she is not a major character. There is no mention of her self-deception or pretense that her husband and son are still alive. The film contains a long scene between Charlie and Mrs. Barham, full of eloquent antiwar rhetoric, in which Charlie breaks down Mrs. Barham's denial and reduces her to tears while insisting that he has performed an act of kindness. The novel has no parallel to this scene. In the film, Charlie is comically unprepared to make the documentary film demanded by Admiral Jessup and is assisted only by bumbling drunken servicemen played by Keenan Wynn and Steve Franken.

The first installment in the  Toy Story franchise, it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The film was directed by John Lasseter and written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, was produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull. The film features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten. Taking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and a modern astronaut action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner, Andy Davis, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy after being separated from him. Following the success of their 1988 short film Tin Toy, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints. Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1995. The film received critical acclaim, and holds a rare 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, wit and thematic sophistication of the screenplay, musical score, and vocal performances ; it is considered by many to be one of the best animated films ever made. The film received three Academy Award nominations , Best Original Song for \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Original Score) as well as winning a Special Achievement Academy Award. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress, Toy Story was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2005.

Though the pilot was produced, it was never released. Twelve years later, on August 12, 2008, CBS commissioned another sequel to Five-O, with Criminal Minds executive producer Edward Allen Bernero appointed to write the pilot. The sequel would center on Steve McGarrett's son. However the sequel was never produced. Later, CBS approached CSI: NY writer Peter M. Lenkov to pitch a reimagined pilot of the show, as Lenkov himself was a fan of the original. When executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman known about the remake, the two were originally hesitant to participate, but were impressed by Lenkov's pitch, since the story had \"such a great kind of paradigm for the show and how to really get into the characters that he really talked us into it.\" All three developed the story of the pilot, though Lenkov was the one who wrote the script. On February 19, 2010, CBS ordered the production of the pilot, with Len Wiseman chosen to direct. It was the first time Wiseman worked on a television program, and it was also the first time he used digital cinematography rather than film. The producers discussed changing Kono to a female character. Lenkov noted that the producers did not have reservations as he initially though, but instead embraced the idea, as it would empower women in the remake by including them as main characters and not just victims or other minor characters. The pilot episode of the original series already established the Five-O task force, and when writing the pilot Lenkov wanted to give a proper introduction to the characters so that the audience can get to know them. Another difference in both the original and reimagined shows was the genre; the original was more police procedural, whereas the remake would be more action orientated, as well as some comedy mixed in, particularly from the banter between McGarrett and Danny. In the original script, there was no fighting between the two main characters, but the producers felt this would launch their partnership. Lenkov also included the return of an iconic catch phrase from the original series, \"Book 'em, Danno\". A table read-through of the pilot took place on February 19, 2010.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The video game Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders contains key references to this movie, such as large-headed aliens disguised as humans, communications through interstellar teleconferencing, and an aircraft pulled into a flying saucer. Shock rock metal band GWAR's fourth album, This Toilet Earth , and its companion short-form movie Skulhedface contain numerous references to this movie, including the title, an alien with an oversized brain posing as a human, and communication between aliens using an interstellar teleconference device.

Just after \"Shore Leave\" was approved for preproduction, his wife and doctor insisted that he take a vacation. The script turned in by renowned science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon had emphasized the importance of fantasy as a component of relaxation, and the network was concerned that the script might be too surreal. Roddenberry assured the network that the script would be rewritten and the fantasy would be de-emphasized before he went on vacation. However, this was not made clear to incoming operational producer Gene L. Coon, who did the rewrite and emphasized the fantasy aspect even more. Roddenberry returned the day before shooting was due to begin and realized that he had a problem. Sturgeon particularly objected to McCoy's bringing back two women to the ship, believing it undermined the emotional tension between McCoy and Tonia. The location shooting that makes up 90% of the episode took place at Africa USA, an animal training preserve where the television series Cowboy in Africa and Daktari often filmed. Star Trek lore says that Roddenberry set up a table, a chair, and a typewriter under a tree, frantically rewriting Coon's revised script, trying to stay ahead of the shooting schedule while maintaining some sort of continuity. This caused a few problems. Even with Roddenberry's rewriting, many of Coon's and Sturgeon's fantasy aspects remained, from an encounter with a samurai, to meeting a tiger , and a scene using an elephant was cut before filming. Gregg Peters, newly promoted to the rank of assistant director, had been detailed to take care of the elephant. During the shoot, the cast and crew teased him about the pachyderm, asking when it would be used.

Because of strict British employment laws for juvenile actors, a succession of actresses took on the lead role every four months. One of the last girls to perform the role at the Victoria Palace before the show went on tour was 10-year-old Claudia Bradley from Leeds who was featured on a 1981 BBC program called Fame. Broadway revival A 20th anniversary Broadway revival, which played at the Martin Beck Theatre in 1997, entitled Annie, the 20th Anniversary, starred Nell Carter as Miss Hannigan, but controversy surrounded the casting of the titular character. The original actress cast in the role, Joanna Pacitti, was fired and replaced by her fellow orphan, Brittny Kissinger just two weeks before her Broadway debut, while battling bronchitis in Boston. The Pre-Broadway Tour was playing the Colonial Theatre. 'Annie' Understudy and Swing Orphan Alexandra Keisman performed the role the first night Pacitti was absent. The producers then gave Kissinger the next performance. The show then moved on to the Oakdale in Connecticut where an insert was placed in the Playbill claiming \"The role of Annie is now being played by Brittny Kissinger\". Public sentiment seemed to side with Pacitti as she was the winner of a highly publicized contest to find a new Annie, sponsored by the department store Macy's. This incident, coupled with the mixed reviews the new staging garnered, doomed it to a short run, although it was followed by a successful national tour. Kissinger, then 8, became the youngest actress to ever play Annie on Broadway. More controversy surrounding the show involved Nell Carter. Carter reportedly was very upset when commercials promoting the show used a different actress, Marcia Lewis, a white actress, as Miss Hannigan. The producers claimed that the commercials, which were made during an earlier production, were too costly to reshoot. Carter felt that racism played a part in the decision. \"Maybe they do not want audiences to know Nell Carter is black\", she told the New York Post. However, the ads did mention that Carter was in the show. \"It hurts a lot\", Carter told the Post, \"I've asked them nicely to stop it \u2014 it's insulting to me as a black woman.\" Later reports stated that \"Nell Carter of Broadway's 'Annie' denied Thursday that she called her show's producers racist because they chose to air commercials featuring a previous Miss Hannigan\u2014who is white\u2014instead of her.\" Her statement, released by the Associated Press, read: \"'Yes, it is true that I and my representatives have gone to management on more than one occasion about the commercial and were told that there was nothing they could do about it,' Carter said in a statement Thursday. 'Therefore, I have resigned myself to the fact that this is the way it is.' The statement also addressed the alleged charges of racism, first published in Thursday's New York Post. Carter is black. 'I, Nell Carter, never, ever, ever accused my producers or anyone in the show of racism,' she said. Producers have said it is too expensive to film a new commercial.\" Carter was later replaced by another white actress, Sally Struthers. The revival closed on October 19, 1997, after 14 previews and 239 performances. West End revival The show was revived at the Victoria Palace, running from September 30, 1998, to February 28, 1999.

In Norman Jewison's romantic comedy Moonstruck, she played an Italian widow in love with her fianc\u00e9's younger brother. The two last films ranked among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1987, at number ten and five, respectively.The New York Times Janet Maslin wrote Moonstruck \"offers further proof that Cher has evolved into the kind of larger-than-life movie star who's worth watching whatever she does.\" For that film, Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. By 1988, Cher had become one of the most bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1\u00a0million per film. That year, she released the fragrance Uninhibited, which earned about $15\u00a0million in its first year sales. In 1987, Cher signed with Geffen Records and revived her musical career with what music critics Johnny Danza and Dean Ferguson describe as \"her most impressive string of hits to date\", establishing her as a \"serious rock and roller\u00a0... a crown that she'd worked long and hard to capture\". Michael Bolton, Jon Bon Jovi, Desmond Child, and Richie Sambora produced her first Geffen album, Cher. Despite facing strong retail and radio airplay resistance upon its release, the album proved to be a commercial success, certified platinum by the RIAA. Cher features the rock ballad \"I Found Someone\", Cher's first US top-ten single in more than eight years. By the end of the 1980s, Cher was also receiving attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men. She had romantic relationships with actors Val Kilmer, Eric Stoltz, and Tom Cruise, hockey player Ron Duguay, film producer Josh Donen, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, and Rob Camilletti, a bagel baker 18-years her junior whom she dated from 1986 to 1989. Cher's 19th studio album Heart of Stone was certified triple platinum by the RIAA. The music video for its second single, \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", caused controversy due to Cher's performance on the battleship , straddling a cannon, and wearing a leather thong that revealed her tattooed buttocks. The song topped the Australian charts for seven weeks, reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became one of Cher's most successful singles. Other songs from Heart of Stone to reach the US top ten were \"After All\", a duet with Peter Cetera, and \"Just Like Jesse James\". At the 1989 People's Choice Awards, Cher won the Favorite All-Around Female Star Award. She embarked on the Heart of Stone Tour in 1989. Most critics liked the tour's nostalgic nature and admired Cher's showmanship. Its parent television special Cher at the Mirage was filmed during a concert in Las Vegas. In her first film in three years, Mermaids , Cher paid tribute to her own mother in this story about a woman who moves her two daughters from town to town at the end of a love affair. She clashed with the film's first two directors, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and Frank Oz, who were replaced by Richard Benjamin. Believing Cher would be the star attraction, the producers allowed her creative control for the film. Mermaids was a box office success and received generally positive reviews.

The player who selected Settler has the option to instead take a quarry tile, which provides a discount on building prices. After each player has had the option to add a plantation, the offer is replenished from a face-down pile so that it contains one more plantation than the number of players. Builder: Each player in turn order has the ability to purchase one building from the central market and add the building to their personal player board. The player who selected Builder receives a one-doubloon discount on any building they purchase, and occupied quarries provide further discounts. There are three types of buildings in the game: production buildings are required for producing goods, \"violet buildings\" grant players in-game advantages when occupied by a colonist, and large violet buildings provide bonus victory points if occupied at the end of the game. Mayor: Each player in turn order takes one colonist from the colonist ship until its supply is exhausted. The player who selected Mayor may then take an additional colonist from the central supply. After this, players may place their newly acquired colonists on their plantations, quarries, and buildings, as well as reposition their existing colonists. If a player has more colonists than available buildings, excess colonists can be stored on the San Juan space to be reassigned in a future Mayor phase. Finally, the colonist ship is replenished with a number of colonists from the supply - either the total number of unoccupied building spaces on all player boards or the total number of players, whichever is larger. Craftsman: Each player produces goods based on their occupied plantations and production buildings, taking them from the supply and storing them on their player boards. Corn can be produced simply by having an occupied plantation, while all other goods require an occupied plantation and an occupied production building. The player who selected Craftsman may produce one additional good of their choosing, provided that they were able to produce at least one of that type. Trader: Each player in turn order has the option to sell one of their resources by placing them on an empty space in the trading house and taking the appropriate number of doubloons in return. Players can only trade goods that are not already in the trading house, and if the trading house is full they cannot trade at all. The player who selected Trader earns an additional doubloon, provided they were able to trade a good. At the end of the phase the trading house is cleared of all goods if all four of its spaces are filled, otherwise it remains partially filled for future Trader phases. Captain: Each player in turn order ships goods in exchange for victory points, placing goods on the empty spaces of one of the available ships and taking one victory point chip for each barrel. The player who selected Captain gains one additional victory point, provided they were able to ship at least one good. The Captain phase is the only phase where player actions are not optional - a player must ship a good if able to, and must ship as many barrels of that good as possible. Each ship can contain only one type of good, and goods cannot be added to ships that have already been filled. The Captain phase continues until it is no longer possible for any player to ship, meaning that some players may get multiple turns in the phase. Afterward, any ships that are completely filled are cleared, while partially filled ships remain so for future Captain phases, and all remaining unshipped goods spoil - players may keep one barrel of their choosing on their player board, but all others are returned to the supply. Prospector: The player who selected Prospector takes one doubloon from the supply, and all other players take no action. The game is played with two Prospectors with five players, one Prospector with four players, and no Prospectors with three players, ensuring that there will always be three unselected roles in every round. Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.  This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Based on a story by O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, it follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo,  who encounter the eponymous Alien, an aggressive and deadly extraterrestrial set loose on the ship. The film stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto. It was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill through their company Brandywine Productions, and was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script; Shusett was executive producer. The Alien and its accompanying artifacts were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human settings. Alien premiered May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival, presented in 70mm at midnight. It received a wide release on June 22 and was released September 6 in the United Kingdom. It was met with mixed reviews on release but was a box-office success, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, three Saturn Awards , and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. In 2002, Alien was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2008, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as the seventh-best film in the science-fiction genre, and as the 33rd-greatest film of all time by Empire. The success of Alien spawned a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting career, providing her with her first lead role. The story of her character's encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic and narrative core of the sequels Aliens , Alien 3 , and Alien Resurrection . A crossover with the Predator franchise produced the Alien vs. Predator films: Alien vs. Predator and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem . A prequel series includes Prometheus and Alien: Covenant , both directed by Scott.", "hasanswer": false}]}
