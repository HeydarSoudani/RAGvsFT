        "content": "The Australian Labor Party , also simply known as Labor, is the major centre-left political party in Australia, one of two major parties in Australian politics, along with the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia. It has been in Opposition in the federal parliament since the 2013 election. The ALP is a federal party, with political branches in each state and territory. They are currently in government in Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory. The Labor Party is the oldest political party in Australia. The ALP was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the Australian parliament in 1901. Nevertheless, it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by the emerging labour movement in Australia, formally beginning in 1891. Colonial labour parties contested seats from 1891, and federal seats following Federation at the 1901 federal election. The ALP formed the world's first labour party government as well as the world's first social-democratic government at a national level. At the 1910 federal election, Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the Australian parliament. At the federal and state/colony level, the Australian Labor Party predates, among others, both the British Labour Party and the New Zealand Labour Party in party formation, government, and policy implementation. Internationally, the ALP is a member of the Progressive Alliance, a network of social-democratic parties, having previously been a member of the Socialist International."

Founded in 1764 as the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Brown is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. At its foundation, Brown was the first college in North America to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation. The university is home to the oldest applied mathematics program in the United States, the oldest engineering program in the Ivy League, and the third-oldest medical program in New England. The university was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887. In 1969, Brown adopted its Open Curriculum after a period of student lobbying. The new curriculum eliminated mandatory \"general education\" distribution requirements, made students \"the architects of their own syllabus\" and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory or no-credit which is unrecorded on external transcripts. In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university. Admission is among the most selective in the United States. In 2021, the university reported a first year acceptance rate of 5.4%. The university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Brown's international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and the university is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design. In conjunction with the Rhode Island School of Design, Brown offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs. Brown's main campus is located in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the western edge of the campus, contains one of the richest concentrations of 17th and 18th century architecture in the United States. , nine Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with Brown as alumni, faculty, or researchers, as well as seven National Humanities Medalists and ten National Medal of Science laureates. Other notable alumni include 26 Pulitzer Prize winners, 19 billionaires, one U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, four U.S. Secretaries of State, 99 members of the United States Congress, 57 Rhodes Scholars, 21 MacArthur Genius Fellows, and 37 Olympic medalists."

        "content": "Chrysler is one of the \"Big Three\" automobile manufacturers in the United States, headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It is the American subsidiary of Dutch-domiciled automotive company Stellantis. In addition to the Chrysler brand, Stellantis North America sells vehicles worldwide under the Dodge, Jeep, and Ram nameplates. It also includes Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division. The original Chrysler Corporation was founded in 1925 by Walter Chrysler from the remains of the Maxwell Motor Company. It was acquired by Daimler-Benz, which in 1998 renamed itself DaimlerChrysler. After Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007, the company operated as Chrysler LLC and Chrysler Group LLC before being acquired by Fiat S.p.A. and becoming a subsidiary of the newly formed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014. Chrysler in 2021 is a subsidiary of Stellantis, the company formed from the merger between FCA and PSA Group in 2021. After founding the company, Walter Chrysler used the General Motors brand diversification and hierarchy strategy that he had become familiar with when he worked in the Buick division at General Motors. He then acquired Fargo Trucks and the Dodge Brothers Company, and created the Plymouth and DeSoto brands in 1928. Facing postwar declines in market share, productivity, and profitability, as GM and Ford were growing, Chrysler borrowed $250 million in 1954 from Prudential Insurance to pay for expansion and updated car designs. Chrysler expanded into Europe by taking control of French, British, and Spanish auto companies in the 1960s; Chrysler Europe was sold in 1978 to PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn for $1. The company struggled to adapt to changing markets, increased U.S. import competition, and safety and environmental regulation in the 1970s. It began an engineering partnership with Mitsubishi Motors, and began selling Mitsubishi vehicles branded as Dodge and Plymouth in North America. On the verge of bankruptcy in the late 1970s, it was saved by $1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government. New CEO Lee Iacocca was credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1985, Diamond-Star Motors was created, further expanding the Chrysler-Mitsubishi relationship. In 1987, Chrysler acquired American Motors Corporation , which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella. In 1998, Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz to form DaimlerChrysler AG; the merger proved contentious with investors. As a result, Chrysler was sold to Cerberus Capital Management and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007. Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was impacted by the automotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010. The company remained in business through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat S.p.A., and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans in a short period. On January 1, 2014, Fiat S.p.A. announced a deal to purchase the rest of Chrysler from the United Auto Workers retiree health trust. The deal was completed on January 21, 2014, making Chrysler Group a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. In May 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles was established by merging Fiat S.p.A. into the company. This was completed in August 2014. Chrysler Group LLC remained a subsidiary until December 15, 2014, when it was renamed FCA US LLC, to reflect the Fiat-Chrysler merger."

The county includes the districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge and West Devon. Plymouth and Torbay are each geographically part of Devon, but are administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is  and its population is about 1.2 million. Devon derives its name from Dumnonia . During the British Iron Age, Roman Britain and the early Middle Ages, this was the homeland of the Dumnonii Brittonic Celts. The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of Wessex during the eighth and ninth centuries. The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the River Tamar by King \u00c6thelstan in 936. Devon was later constituted as a shire of the Kingdom of England. The north and south coasts of Devon each have both cliffs and sandy shores, and the county's bays contain seaside resorts, fishing towns and ports. The inland terrain is rural, generally hilly and has a lower population density than many other parts of England. Dartmoor is the largest open space in southern England, at ; its moorland extends across a large expanse of granite bedrock. To the north of Dartmoor are the Culm Measures and Exmoor. In the valleys and lowlands of south and east Devon the soil is more fertile, drained by rivers including the Exe, the Culm, the Teign, the Dart and the Otter. As well as agriculture, much of the economy of Devon is based on tourism. The comparatively mild climate, coastline and landscape make Devon a destination for recreation and leisure in England. Visitors are particularly attracted to the Dartmoor and Exmoor national parks; its coasts, including the resort towns along the south coast known collectively as the English Riviera; the Jurassic Coast and North Devon's UNESCO Biosphere Reserve; and the countryside including the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape."

It has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning at least 3,400 years of written records. Its writing system is the Greek alphabet, which has been used for approximately 2,800 years; previously, Greek was recorded in writing systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems. The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world. Beginning with the epics of Homer, ancient Greek literature includes many works of lasting importance in the European canon. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science and philosophy were originally composed. The New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek. Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the Greek texts and Greek societies of antiquity constitute the objects of study of the discipline of Classics. During antiquity, Greek was by far the most widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world. It eventually became the official language of the Byzantine Empire and developed into Medieval Greek. In its modern form, Greek is the official language of Greece and Cyprus and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. It is spoken by at least 13.5 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the many other countries of the Greek diaspora. Greek roots have been widely used for centuries and continue to be widely used to coin new words in other languages; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary."

        "content": "Old English , or Anglo-Saxon, is the earliest recorded form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages. It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the mid-5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century. After the Norman conquest of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, by Anglo-Norman as the language of the upper classes. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, since during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as Middle English in England and Early Scots in Scotland. Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or Ingvaeonic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes. As the Germanic settlers became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language; and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian, and Scots from Northumbrian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century. Old English is one of the West Germanic languages, and its closest relatives are Old Frisian and Old Saxon. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and Modern Scots, and largely incomprehensible for Modern English or Modern Scots speakers without study.  Within Old English grammar nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms, and word order is much freer. The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a runic system, but from about the 8th century this was replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet."

        "content": "The Royal Navy is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by English and Scottish kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years' War against France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is consequently known as the Senior Service. From the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the Dutch Navy and later with the French Navy for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the Second World War. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing and defending the British Empire, and four Imperial fortress colonies and a string of imperial bases and coaling stations secured the Royal Navy's ability to assert naval superiority globally. Owing to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification. Following World War I, it was significantly reduced in size, although at the onset of World War II it was still the world's largest. During the Cold War, the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force, hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, its focus has returned to expeditionary operations around the world and it remains one of the world's foremost blue-water navies. The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships, submarines, and aircraft, including 2 aircraft carriers, 2 amphibious transport docks, 4 ballistic missile submarines , 6 nuclear fleet submarines, 6 guided missile destroyers, 12 frigates, 11 mine-countermeasure vessels and 26 patrol vessels. As of August 2021, there are 75 operational commissioned ships in the Royal Navy, plus 11 ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ; there are also five Merchant Navy ships available to the RFA under a private finance initiative. The RFA replenishes Royal Navy warships at sea, and augments the Royal Navy's amphibious warfare capabilities through its three  vessels. It also works as a force multiplier for the Royal Navy, often doing patrols that frigates used to do. The Royal Navy is part of Her Majesty's Naval Service, which also includes the Royal Marines. The professional head of the Naval Service is the First Sea Lord who is an admiral and member of the Defence Council of the United Kingdom. The Defence Council delegates management of the Naval Service to the Admiralty Board, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Royal Navy operates from three bases in Britain where commissioned ships and submarines are based: Portsmouth, Clyde and Devonport, the last being the largest operational naval base in Western Europe, as well as two naval air stations, RNAS Yeovilton and RNAS Culdrose where maritime aircraft are based."

She was launched in 1797, one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed. The name \"Constitution\" was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March of 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed. Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so Constitution and her sister ships were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. She was built at Edmund Hartt's shipyard in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. Her first duties were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War. Constitution is most noted for her actions during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom, when she captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships: , , , , and . The battle with Guerriere earned her the nickname \"Old Ironsides\" and public adoration that has repeatedly saved her from scrapping. She continued to serve as flagship in the Mediterranean and African squadrons, and she circled the world in the 1840s. During the American Civil War, she served as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy. She carried American artwork and industrial displays to the Paris Exposition of 1878. Constitution was retired from active service in 1881 and served as a receiving ship until being designated a museum ship in 1907. In 1934, she completed a three-year, 90-port tour of the nation. She sailed under her own power for her 200th birthday in 1997, and again in August 2012 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of her victory over Guerriere. Constitutions stated mission today is to promote understanding of the Navy's role in war and peace through educational outreach, historical demonstration, and active participation in public events as part of the Naval History & Heritage Command. As she is a fully commissioned Navy ship, her crew of 75 officers and sailors participate in ceremonies, educational programs, and special events while keeping her open to visitors year round and providing free tours. The officers and crew are all active-duty Navy personnel, and the assignment is considered to be special duty.

When its mission was complete, the orbiter would reenter the Earth's atmosphere and land like a glider at either the Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base. The Shuttle is the only winged crewed spacecraft to have achieved orbit and landing, and the first reusable crewed space vehicle that has made multiple flights into orbit.  Its missions involved carrying large payloads to various orbits including the International Space Station , providing crew rotation for the space station, and performing service missions on the Hubble Space Telescope. The orbiter also recovered satellites and other payloads from orbit and returned them to Earth, though its use in this capacity was rare. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years' operational life.

Tocantins covers  and had an estimated population of 1,496,880 in 2014. Construction of its capital, Palmas, began in 1989; most of the other cities in the state date to the Portuguese colonial period. With the exception of Aragua\u00edna there are few other cities with a significant population in the state. The government has invested in a new capital, a major hydropower dam, railroads and related infrastructure to develop this primarily agricultural area. The state has 0.75% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 0.5% of the Brazilian GDP. Tocantins has attracted hundreds of thousands of new residents, primarily to Palmas. It is building on its hydropower resources. The Araguaia and Tocantins rivers drain the largest watershed that lies entirely inside Brazilian territory.  The Rio Tocantins has been dammed for hydropower, creating a large reservoir that has become a center of recreation. Because it is in the central zone of the country, Tocantins has characteristics of the Amazon Basin, and also semi-open pastures, known as cerrado. The Bananal Island , in the southwest of the State, is the second largest fluvial island in the world. Tocantins is also home to the Araguaia National Park, the Caraj\u00e1s Indian reservations, and Jalap\u00e3o State Park, which is about  from Palmas. There, the rivers create oases in the dry landscape, attracting many ecotourists to the region."

The Burns\u2013Hines region has a high-desert climate but was much wetter in the recent geologic past. The Harney Basin was the largest of many depressions in which lakes formed in southeastern Oregon during the late Pleistocene. Remnants of an ancient lake that reached as far north as Burns are at the center of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, south of the city. Northern Paiutes or their ancestors, who were hunter-gatherers, have lived in the region for thousands of years. Since the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19th\u00a0century, cattle ranching and other forms of agriculture have dominated land use in the area. In 1930, logging in the mountains north of Burns led to the creation of Hines, a lumber company town, and the timber industry remained important to the local economy until the 1990s. In addition to ranching, a variety of private and public enterprises support the Burns\u2013Hines economy in the 21st\u00a0century.

There is also a sizeable linguistic island in the Vojvodina, Serbia and a Rusyn diaspora throughout the world.

Other names are sometimes also used to refer to the language, mainly deriving from exonyms such as Ruthenian or Ruthene , that have more general meanings, and thus some specific designations are formed, such as: Carpathian Ruthenian/Ruthene or Carpatho-Ruthenian/Ruthene. The categorization of Rusyn as a language or dialect is a source of controversy.

Based on a tokamak design, the fusion research facility is a joint European project with a main purpose of opening the way to future nuclear fusion grid energy. At the design stage JET was larger than any such machine then in production. JET was built with the hope of reaching scientific breakeven where the fusion energy gain factor Q =1.0. It began operation in 1983 and spent most of the next decade increasing its performance in a lengthy series of experiments and upgrades. In 1991 the first experiments including tritium were made, making JET the first reactor in the world to run on the production fuel of a 50\u201350 mix of tritium and deuterium. It was also decided to add a diverter design to JET, which occurred between 1991 and 1993. Performance was significantly improved, and in 1997 JET set the record for the closest approach to scientific breakeven, reaching Q = 0.67 in 1997, producing 16\u00a0MW of fusion power while injecting 24\u00a0MW of thermal power to heat the fuel. Between 2009 and 2011, JET was shut down to rebuild many of its parts, to adopt concepts being used in the development of the ITER project in Saint-Paul-l\u00e8s-Durance, in Provence, southern France. In December 2020, a JET upgrade commenced using tritium, as part of its contribution to ITER. On 21 December 2021, using deuterium-tritium fuel, JET produced 59 megajoules during a five second pulse, beating its previous 1997 record of 21.7 megajoules, with Q = 0.33."

It operates as a deep-level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark, trains run in open cuts, at grade level, and on elevated track. The routes of the PATH system were originally operated by the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad , built to link New Jersey's Hudson Waterfront with New York City. The system began operations in 1908 and was fully built out in 1911. Three stations have since closed; two others were re-located after a re-alignment of the western terminus. From the 1920s, the rise of automobile travel and the concurrent construction of bridges and tunnels across the river sent the H&M into a financial decline from which it never recovered, and it was forced into bankruptcy in 1954. As part of the deal that cleared the way for the construction of the original World Trade Center, the Port Authority bought the H&M out of receivership in 1962 and renamed it PATH. In the 2000s and 2010s the system suffered considerably from disasters that affected the region, most notably the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Sandy. Both private and public stakeholders have proposed expanding PATH service in New Jersey, and an extension to Newark Liberty International Airport may be constructed in the 2020s. Although PATH has long operated as a rapid transit system, it is legally a commuter railroad under the jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration ; its trackage between Newark and Jersey City is located in close proximity to Northeast Corridor trackage and shares the Newark Dock Bridge with intercity and commuter trains. All PATH train operators must therefore be licensed railroad engineers and extra inspections are required. PATH currently uses one class of rolling stock, the PA5, which was delivered in 2009\u20132011."

The new party combined the conservative AP with several small Christian democratic and liberal parties . In 2002, Manuel Fraga received the honorary title of \"Founding Chairman\". The party's youth organization is New Generations of the People's Party of Spain . The PP is a member of the centre-right European People's Party , and in the European Parliament its 16 MEPs sit in the EPP Group. The PP is also a member of the Centrist Democrat International and the International Democrat Union. The PP was also one of the founding organizations of the Budapest-based Robert Schuman Institute for Developing Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe. On 24 May 2018, the National Court found that the PP profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the G\u00fcrtel case, confirming the existence of an illegal accounting and financing structure that ran in parallel with the party's official one since the party's foundation in 1989 and ruling that the PP helped establish \"a genuine and effective system of institutional corruption through the manipulation of central, autonomous and local public procurement\". This prompted a no confidence vote on Mariano Rajoy's government, which was brought down on 1 June 2018 in the first successful motion since the Spanish transition to democracy. On 5 June 2018, Rajoy announced his resignation as PP leader. On 21 July 2018 Pablo Casado was elected as the new leader of the PP. Under his leadership, the party was claimed to take a right-wing turn, including forging local alliances with the far-right Vox party. However later Casado bet on breaking ties with Vox, and caused an unprecidented leadership crysis inside PP, which collapsed popular support for PP accoding to opinion polls for future national elections."

It is the only political party in the Czech Republic that has always been represented in the Chamber of Deputies. Founded in 1991 as the pro-free market wing of the Civic Forum by V\u00e1clav Klaus and modeled on the British Conservative Party, the ODS won the 1992 legislative election, and has remained in government for most of the Czech Republic's independence. In every legislative election it emerged as one of the two strongest parties. V\u00e1clav Klaus served as the first Prime Minister of the Czech Republic after the partition of Czechoslovakia, from 1993 to 1997. Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, who succeeded him as leader of the party in December 2002, served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2009. In the 2010 election, the party lost 28 seats, finishing second, but as the largest party right of the centre, it formed a centre-right government with Petr Ne\u010das as Prime Minister. In the 2013 legislative election, the party was marginalized by only securing 16 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, relegating the party to the opposition from July 2013 to December 2021. In the 2017 legislative election, it has partly recovered and secured 25 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, making it the second strongest party in chamber. The party is currently being led by the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala, who has been leader since the 2014 party convention. The ODS is a member of the International Democratic Union, and co-founded together with the British Conservatives the eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists Party and the European Conservatives and Reformists in the European Parliament."

The CEN was founded in 1961. Its thirty-four national members work together to develop European Standards in various sectors to build a European internal market for goods and services and to position Europe in the global economy. CEN is officially recognized as a European standards body by the European Union, European Free Trade Association and the United Kingdom; the other official European standards bodies are the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute . More than 60,000 technical experts as well as business federations, consumer and other societal interest organizations are involved in the CEN network that reaches over 460 million people. CEN is the officially recognized standardization representative for sectors other than electrotechnical and telecommunications . On 12 February 1999, the European Parliament noted in a resolution that CEN, CENELEC and ETSI co-operate smoothly and that a merger of the three standardization bodies would not have clear advantages. The standardization bodies of the thirty national members represent the twenty seven member states of the European Union, three countries of the European Free Trade Association , the United Kingdom and other countries that are highly integrated into the European economy. CEN is contributing to the objectives of the European Union and European Economic Area with technical standards which promote free trade, the safety of workers and consumers, interoperability of networks, environmental protection, exploitation of research and development programmes, and public procurement. An example of harmonized standards are those for materials and products used in construction and listed under the Construction Products Directive. The CE mark is a declaration by the manufacturer that a product complies with all relevant EU directives. CEN owns the Keymark, a voluntary quality mark for products and services. A product bearing the Keymark demonstrates conformity to European Standards."

It has the rank of a Major Archiepiscopal Church and it uses the Byzantine liturgical rite in the Romanian language. It is part of the Major Archiepiscopal Churches of the Catholic Church that are not distinguished with a patriarchal title. Cardinal Lucian Mure\u0219an, Archbishop of F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 and Alba Iulia, has served as the head of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church since 1994. On December 16, 2005, as the Romanian Church United with Rome, the Greek-Catholic church was elevated to the rank of a Major Archiepiscopal Church by Pope Benedict XVI, with Lucian Mure\u0219an becoming its first major archbishop. Mure\u015fan was eventually created a cardinal, at the consistory of February 18, 2012. Besides the Archeparchy of F\u01ceg\u01cera\u0219 and Alba Iulia, there are five more Greek-Catholic eparchies in Romania , as well as one eparchy overseas, the Romanian Catholic Eparchy of St George's in Canton, answering directly to the Major Archbishop and the Holy See, in the United States of America and Canada. According to data published in the 2016 Annuario Pontificio, the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church had 504,280 members, 8 bishops, 1,225 parishes, some 835  diocesan priests and 235 seminarians of its own rite at the end of 2012. However, according to the 2011 Romanian government census, the number of its followers living in Romania was as low as 150,593, of which 124,563 are ethnic Romanians. The dispute over this figure is mentioned in the United States Department of State report on religious freedom in Romania. In addition, there are five other Catholic dioceses in Romania, belonging to the Latin Church, whose members are more numerous."

It was generally viewed to be further left than Alexa McDonough's leadership, but not as far left as the Socialist Caucus. The NPI believed that the NDP was moving too close to the right, and was dangerously close to becoming another Liberal Party. It believed in uniting Canada's left to combat that. The NPI viewed Canada's left as being more than just the labour unions, but rather as appealing to a staunch left wing who believe in anti-globalization, feminism, gay rights, and environmentalism. The NPI attributed the poor showing of the NDP in recent years to having alienated its left-wing base by moving towards the centre, and wished to bring these activists into the NDP by adopting their views. The NPI was founded in June 2001, and was soon joined by British Columbian Members of Parliament Libby Davies and Svend Robinson. Other prominent members included Judy Rebick and Jim Stanford.  The NPI originally called for the NDP to disband and form another, more left wing, party under a different name with the participation of social movements. It was said that this would have followed the path set by the NDP when it was created in 1961 by its predecessor party, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and labour unions, but the NPI did not propose a formal merger, but a disbanding. The NPI never articulated a specific plan for how social movements could be integrated into the NDP. At the NDP convention held in Winnipeg in November 2001, opponents of the initiative used that lack of detail to defeat the proposal. The NPI's resolution managed to win the support of almost 40 per cent of convention delegates. When Jack Layton won the NDP leadership in January 2003, it was taken as a victory by the NPI, with whom Layton had sympathized, but never joined. Key NPI leaders such as Robinson, Davies and Rebick supported Layton's campaign for leader. With Layton's election the NPI became less vocal and formally dissolved in early 2004, with a concluding public meeting being held on February 22."

The town is at the feet of the Ysterberg and is surrounded by the Witfonteinrand and Boshofberg with the majestic Kransberg in the background. The name Thabazimbi means mountain of iron because of the large iron ore reef that was discovered in 1919 by J. H. Williams. The mine boasts one of the largest mining shafts in Africa. More than 2 million tons of ore are mined every year and hauled by train to Mittal's iron and steel works. The railway line from Rustenburg reached the area in the 1930s and full scale iron and steel production began. The town was proclaimed in 1953. Kumba Iron Ore, previously Kumba Resources, is now the principal operator of the iron ore mine. The Marakele National Park about 20\u00a0km north-east of the town and in the heart of Waterberg Mountains is characterised by contrasting mountain landscapes, hills and valleys, as well a variety of wildlife.  Marakele National Park is also the home of some of the Tuli Elephants that were caught up in controversy in 1999 involving animal cruelty in South Africa. In the post-apartheid era, the town made headlines in 2003 as the site of Kamp Staaldraad, the Springboks' infamous training camp prior to the Rugby World Cup.  The excesses of Kamp Staaldraad helped lead to an almost complete housecleaning of the upper administrative levels of South African rugby union."

It is located approximately  southeast of the southern end of Waterton Lake, and approximately  south of the US\u2013Canada border. The east side of the future national park was purchased by the federal government from the Blackfoot Confederacy in 1895 during the second term of President Grover Cleveland. According to the United States Board on Geographic Names, the mountain is named for the former president. While not of great absolute elevation , Mount Cleveland is notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain. For example, its west flank rises over  in less than ; the northwest face, the steepest on the mountain, rises  in less than . The other faces show almost as much vertical relief. This scale and steepness of relief is quite rare in the contiguous United States. Mount Cleveland ranks 50th on the list of peaks in the contiguous U.S. with the greatest topographic prominence. The massif upon which Mount Cleveland is situated also includes  Kaiser Point, which is the seventh-highest peak in the park and is only  to the northeast. The first recorded ascent of Mount Cleveland was in 1920 by Frank B. Wynn. The easiest route on the peak is the West Face route, starting from the Waterton Valley; it is a Class 3 scramble with the possibility of some short exposed Class 4 sections. Other routes include the Stoney Indian Route, from Stoney Indian Pass to the south of the peak, first descended by noted Sierra mountaineer Norman Clyde and party in 1937; various routes on the Southeast Face; and the more difficult North Face, climbed partially in 1971 and completely in 1976. Although the peak has a relatively low fatality record, five Montana climbers were killed on the peak's west face in December 1969. The climbers were swept away by an avalanche and were not found for seven months."

Its favorable position in the area known as Old Serbia, along the Ra\u0161ka gorge, on the crossroads and trading routes between neighbouring regions of Zeta and Bosnia in the west and Kosovo and Metohija in the south, added to its importance as a city. Today the fortress of Arsa lies in mostly unenclosed and unprotected ruins. However, there are plans for future reconstruction of the site. In the close vicinity of Arsa there is impressive group of medieval monuments consisting of fortresses, old market-places, churches and monasteries. Serbian medieval Monastery of Sopo\u0107ani near Arsa is a reminder of the contacts between Western world and the Byzantine world.

The nearest Inuit village is Umiujaq, about  north-northeast of Kuujjuarapik. The police services in Kuujjuaraapik are provided by the Nunavik Police Service, formerly the Kativik Regional Police Force. Like most other northern villages in Quebec, there is an Inuit reserved land of the same name, Kuujjuarapik. However, unlike most other Inuit reserved lands, the Inuit reserved land of Kuujjuarapik is not adjacent to its eponymous northern village; rather, it is located considerably farther north and in fact borders on the Inuit reserved land of Umiujaq. Although the permanent cohabitation of Inuit and Cree at the mouth of the Great Whale River only goes back to the year 1950, the two Indigenous peoples were rubbing shoulders in this area for a very long time: Inuit close to the coast and the Cree more in the interior lands."

The state road runs for just over , passing through five counties in northern Indiana, mostly through rural farm fields and small towns. The largest city along its path is Huntington. It is entirely a surface highway that is very rural outside of the towns. SR 5 runs along two dams the first being J. Edward Roush Lake Dam and the second being the Wilmot Dam. Dating back to the early days of the state road system, SR 5 was first signed in the southern part of the state in the 1920s. During the 1930s, the highway was moved to northern Indiana, before being moved very soon after to its current alignment. The road was extended to the Michigan state line in the late 1930s. In the mid-1960s SR 5 had its southern end moved north to Warren. Within the next several year the northern end was moved to SR 120 from the Michigan state line. Around the mid-1980s SR 5 was extended south SR 22 in Upland, replacing an old state road that was decommissioned around ten years earlier."

WFUS is one of the eight stations in the Tampa Bay market owned by iHeartMedia. The station formerly went by \"Thunder 103.5\" as a classic rock station that started on March 14, 1995, on 105.5 FM. Ron Diaz worked as the morning drive host at that time. On April 5, 1999, WTBT swapped frequencies with then-sister station WDUV, moving to 103.5 FM. Towards the end of the station's days, it was the Tampa affiliate for The Bob and Tom Show. On April 13, 2005, WTBT flipped to its current country format as WFUS, \"US 103.5\", leaving Cox Radio's WHPT as the market's only classic rock station at that time. iHeartMedia later relaunched the classic rock format as \"Thunder Across The Bay\", operating on FM translators at 94.5 FM , 99.1 FM , 105.9 FM , and on WMTX-HD2. In August 2014, its HD2 subchannel's format changed to \"Soft EZ Oldies\", a format meant to compete with market leader WDUV. Prior to that, the HD2 subchannel was classic rock, branded as \"Thunder 103.5 HD2\". In September 2014, WFUS-HD2 flipped once again, as alternative/new rock formatted \"ALT 99-9\", meant to compete with Cox Radio's WSUN. \"ALT\" was also broadcast on FM translator W207BU at 99.9\u00a0MHz, located in Bayonet Point. On November 7, 2014, at Noon, W207BU moved from 99.9\u00a0MHz to 100.3\u00a0MHz to eliminate interference with WXJB in Brooksville. The station then re-branded as \"ALT 100.3\". The translator also changed call letters, and is now identifying as W262CP. On March 14, 2016, the \"ALT\" format was replaced with a rebroadcast of iHeart's Sarasota-based tropical/Latin pop-formatted WRUB \"Rumba 106.5\". WFUS was the official flagship station of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2004 to 2016. Games are now airing on WXTB."

Known for most of its length as Central Avenue, the highway runs  from Southern Avenue and East Capitol Street at the District of Columbia boundary in Capitol Heights east to Beverley Beach. MD 214 connects the central Prince George's County suburbs of Capitol Heights, Seat Pleasant, Largo, and Bowie with the southern Anne Arundel County communities of Davidsonville and Edgewater and several beach villages along the Chesapeake Bay. The highway connects Interstate 95 /I-495 to FedExField, Six Flags America, and several stations of the Washington Metro's Blue and Silver lines, which the route parallels between Capitol Heights and Largo. MD 214 was constructed as part of three state highways. MD 214 proper was constructed in the mid-1910s from Washington to Largo and extended east to what is now U.S. Route 301 through the 1920s. MD 254 was built from MD 2 in Edgewater west to Davidsonville in the early to mid-1920s. MD 253 was constructed from the modern end of the highway southeast to Beverley Beach between the mid-1920s and early 1930s. The gap between Bowie and Davidsonville was filled in the mid-1930s; MD 214 was extended east across a new Patuxent River bridge and took over MD 254's route to Edgewater. In the late 1940s, MD 214 was relocated through Edgewater and extended along most of MD 253 to Beverley Beach. The state highway was widened in Prince George's County in the 1930s and again in the 1950s, and from US 301 to MD 2 in the 1940s and again in the 1950s. MD 214 was expanded to a divided highway at US 301 in the late 1950s, at its interchange with the Capital Beltway in the mid-1960s, and when it bypassed Capitol Heights in the late 1960s. The two-lane gaps between those three segments were filled in the 1980s and 1990s."

Altimo Holdings & Investments Ltd. is a British Virgin Islands company. A majority of its shares are owned by CTF Holdings, a Gibraltar limited liability company, whose sole shareholder is Crown Finance Foundation, a Liechtenstein foundation. Since its formation in 2004, Altimo has been involved in numerous conflicts with all its main partners in each of the four companies which form the backbone of its investments. These conflicts have resulted in what Judge Lynch of the United States District Court, Southern District of New York described as a \"brazen history of collusive and vexatious litigation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009used to avoid compliance with their legal obligations\". In November 2005, Altimo acquired a 13.2% stake in Turkcell, the largest Turkish mobile phone operator. This acquisition was the subject of considerable controversy due to doubt whether the Turkish Group Cukurova was in violation of a shareholders agreement it had in place with TeliaSonera, the other major shareholder in Turkcell. Altimo was also engaged in a dispute with TeliaSonera over MegaFon at the time of this transaction. In July 2007, Altimo and the Bermuda-based IPOC International Growth Fund, which was closely associated with Jeffrey Galmond and Leonid Reiman, settled their disputes agreeing to Altimo's ownership of the 25% stake in MegaFon that was previously held by Leonid Rozhetskin's LV Finance. Altimo's efforts to expand into India met with a rebuff when the home ministry observed that Altimo and its parent company, Alpha, have a \"tainted background\". In April 2010 it was reported that \"Altimo\" package of MegaFon shares was pledged by Vnesheconombank. They have become the provision of $1.5 billion loan instead of the 44% stake in VimpelCom. The change of pledge has been needed for the formation of capital Vimpelcom Ltd."

The last known natively fluent speaker of Penobscot, Madeline Shay, died in 1993. However, several Penobscot elders still speak Penobscot, and there is an ongoing effort to preserve it and teach it in the local schools; much of the language was preserved by Frank Siebert.   Other dialects of Eastern Abenaki such as Caniba and Aroosagunticook are documented in French-language materials from the colonial period. By 2006 five speakers of Western Abenaki were recorded."

The lighthouse and the tiny island itself has become a well known tourist spot in Western Norway. It has a ferry connection with the other islands in Sand\u00f8y and to the island of Gossa in Aukra Municipality. The island has a population of about 40, with a gradually diminishing population for the last 50 years. Ona has been populated for centuries because of the proximity to the fishing grounds further out to the Atlantic Ocean, and fishing has traditionally been the only source of income. Lately, several pottery artists have moved to the island. Ona was featured, along with \"Morning Song\" by Babe Rainbow, in the Allstate Insurance Company's television commercial in 2020."

It opened its doors to commercial traffic on June 14, 2007, after a decade of planning and construction, replacing Mandurriao Airport in Mandurriao, Iloilo City which had been in service for over seventy years.  As a result, the new airport inherited its IATA and ICAO airport codes, as well as its position as the fourth-busiest airport in the Philippines, from its predecessor.  It is the first airport in both Western Visayas and the island of Panay to be built to international standards, and it is also considered to be the primary gateway into the region. It is classified as an international airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. The airport is located in Cabatuan, Iloilo,  northwest of Iloilo City on a  site spread across Barangays Tabucan, Tiring, Gaub, Duyan-Duyan and Manguna. The airport complex consists of a single runway, various administrative and maintenance buildings, waste-sorting and water-treatment facilities, a power-generating station, a cargo terminal, and a main passenger terminal.  Its location on the Tomas Confesor Highway, a major highway transversing the island, makes the airport accessible from all parts of Iloilo and Panay by road, while its proximity to the currently defunct Panay Railways network could potentially link the airport to the rest of Panay by rail. Since it opened in 2007, Iloilo International Airport is one of the largest airports constructed in the Philippines. During its inauguration, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo remarked that the airport was the most beautiful and modern in the country and called it a symbol of both political will and economic maturity."

It offers degree programs for undergraduates, especially transfer programs such as 2+2 or 3+1 for  undergraduates who want to transfer to the United States, Canada or other countries. As the government universities of Sri Lanka only accept 5-10% of the students who sit for the local G.C.E. Advance level examination, there was a question mark for the rest of students\u2019 higher educations. After the political issues the Institute of Technological Studies was approved under the Section 25 A of the Amended University Act No. 16 of 1978 on 15 December 1988. The Institute of Technological Studies was established in 1984 as a private university on a  plot of land in the heart of Colombo, founded by Dr. Edirisinghe, the president of ITS. In June 1985, ITS started to offer B.S degree in Computer science in affiliation with the University of Houston\u2013Clear Lake. It became the first institute in Sri Lanka to offer business degrees in 1987 by creating a business administration faculty. Since 1991, the institute has expanded its activities by offering the first three years of the majority of the bachelor's degrees offered in US universities. The Troy University in Troy, Alabama has joined with The ITS by offering the entire Computer Science and Business Administration degree to the Sri Lankan students. The degree obtained in ITS will be exactly the same as one gained at University. The ITS campus facilities include a canteen, recreation facilities and landscaped grounds and benches that allow for socialization between classes. ITS established OASIS Hospital in the year 2000 with intention of setting up a medical school affiliated to the ITS. OASIS Hospital is located in the healthcare hub of the Colombo City and very close in proximity to Apollo Hospital Colombo. It is a modern multi-storey complex sprawled over  wooded land in the Colombo. In May 2009, ITS announced that it had formed a partnership to open a branch campus of St. Theresa's Medical University in Colombo, Sri Lanka beginning in June 2009, with approximately 75 students, for which STMU claimed to have government approval. These plans ended when STMU closed in August 2009.\"Health Education Associates Unlimited, Inc.\", the investment firm promoted by STM Founder and Chancellor M. Thomas Uhrin and STMU President and CEO Jeffrey T. Irwin to finance the Sri Lanka and Italy expansions, folded in 2009, leaving investors unpaid. A former US Attorney who examined the firm's agreements characterized it as fitting the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme; in December 2009, Uhrin denied that it was a plan to defraud investors."

Politically the village forms part of the Br\u00e8-Aldesago quarter of the city of Lugano, although until 1972 Br\u00e8-Aldesago was an independent municipality, known simply as Br\u00e8 until 1953. The village of Br\u00e8 was first recorded in 1280 as de Bre, and for most of its history has lived by agriculture and livestock. Until 1912, the only access to the village was on foot or by mule, but in that year Br\u00e8 was reached by a road from Lugano, and the Monte Br\u00e8 funicular was opened between Lugano and the summit of Monte Br\u00e8. Subsequently Br\u00e8 has become a resort and residential suburb. Br\u00e8 is accessed by a steep and winding road from Lugano. This first climbs to the village of Aldesago, before crossing the southern slopes of Monte Br\u00e8 to reach Br\u00e8 village. Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi bus route 12 operates along this road from Lugano city centre to Br\u00e8 village, with one or two buses per hour. The Monte Br\u00e8 funicular, which connects the Lugano suburb of Cassarate, itself served by frequent city buses, to the summit of Monte Br\u00e8, serves a stop known as Br\u00e8 Villagio, although this is a  walk from the village itself. The funicular runs every half-hour. The Wilhelm Schmid Museum, in the village, is the former residence of Wilhelm Schmid and today contains a collection of his works. Schmid was the only Swiss painter of the northern Magical Realism style. The village is also home to an artistic trail that includes the works of 20 nationally and internationally acclaimed artists. The parish church of Saints Simon and Fedele is first mentioned in 1591, in an account of a visit by Feliciano Ninguarda, then bishop of Como. It is believed, however, to date back to medieval times, and the tower, located in the southeast corner of the basilica, has Romanesque blind arches on its base. The church contains artistic works from different eras, including 17th-century frescos and 20th-century paintings by Jozeph Bir\u00f2, a Hungarian painter and one-time resident of the village."

They were equally disturbed by Kwame Nkrumah's aggressive involvement in African politics and by his belief that Ghanaian troops could be sent anywhere in Africa to fight so-called liberation wars, even though they never did so. Above all, they pointed to the absence of democratic practices in the nation\u2014a situation they claimed had affected the morale of the armed forces. According to General Kotoka, the military coup of 1966 was a nationalist one because it liberated the nation from Nkrumah's dictatorship\u2014a declaration that was supported by Alex Quaison Sackey, Nkrumah's former minister of foreign affairs. Despite the vast political changes that were brought about by the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah, many problems remained. For example, the underlying ethnic and regional divisions within the society had to be addressed. The apparent spirit of national unity that seemed to have developed during the Nkrumah years turned out to have resulted in part from his coercive powers as well as from his charisma. As a consequence, successive new leaders faced the problem of forging disparate personal, ethnic, and sectional interests into a nation with shared identity and interests. The economic burdens, aggravated by what some described as past extravagance, crippled each future government's ability to foster the rapid development needed to satisfy even minimal popular demands for a better life. The fear of a resurgence of an overly strong central authority continued to dominate the constitutional agenda and to pervade the thinking of many educated, politically minded Ghanaians. Others, however, felt that a strong government was essential. A considerable portion of the population had become convinced that effective, honest government was incompatible with competitive political parties. Many Ghanaians remained committed to non-political leadership for the nation, even in the form of military rule. The problems of the Busia administration, the country's first elected government after Nkrumah's fall, illustrated the problems Ghana would continue to face."

        "content": "The Sinaloa Cartel , also known as the CDS, the Guzm\u00e1n-Loera Organization, the Pacific Cartel, the Federation and the Blood Alliance, is a large international drug trafficking, money laundering, and organized crime syndicate established in Mexico during the late 1980s as one of a various number of \"plazas\" operating under a predecessor organization known as the Guadalajara Cartel. It is currently headed by Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda and is based in the city of Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa, with operations in many world regions but primarily in the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Baja California, Durango, Sonora, and Chihuahua. It also has a notable presence in a number of other regions in Latin America, such as Colombia; as well as in cities across the U.S. The United States Intelligence Community generally considers the Sinaloa Cartel to be the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the Western Hemisphere, making it perhaps even more influential and capable than the infamous Medell\u00edn Cartel of Colombia was during its prime. It has repeatedly been said to be one of the strongest criminal organizations in the world and indisputably the most powerful in Mexico since at least the late 2000s and early 2010s by various sources including the Los Angeles Times. The Sinaloa Cartel operates in the \"Golden Triangle\", the states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. The region is a major producer of Mexican opium and marijuana. Despite trafficking various types of illicit substances, the cartel's operations seem to mostly favor the trade of cocaine and opioids, particularly in a distribution hub like Chicago, where demand for methamphetamine is relatively low. According to the U.S. Attorney General, the Sinaloa Cartel was responsible for importing into the United States and distributing nearly  of cocaine and large amounts of heroin between 1990 and 2008. Around 2014, a measurable rise in Colombian cocaine production and global consumption began to increase annually up to the present, currently marking a new high-point for global use of the drug. As of 2021, due to the high profit margins of its cocaine trafficking networks, the Sinaloa Cartel is currently the most active Mexican cartel in Colombian territory and partners with the National Liberation Army , dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , and the neo-paramilitary gang, Clan del Golfo, whom it purportedly helps finance. Both the CDS and CJNG have also recently began to participate directly in cocaine production in Colombia, not only to buy, but also to invest in production directly through other criminal organizations. The cartel however also appears to still have major methamphetamine operations in cities throughout the U.S., such as in San Diego and Atlanta. According to the National Drug Intelligence Center and other sources, within the U.S. the Sinaloa Cartel is primarily involved in the distribution of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl, cannabis and MDMA. It is currently the majority supplier of illicit fentanyl to North America, with most, if not all of the cartel\u2019s heroin now also being mixed with fentanyl or related chemical analogues to increase the heroin\u2019s \u201cpotency\u201d in a more cost-effective manner.  , the Sinaloa Cartel is overall the most active drug cartel involved in smuggling illicit drugs into the United States and trafficking them throughout the country. As mentioned previously, the organization is currently heavily involved in the manufacture and distribution of fentanyl, much of which consists of making and selling counterfeit \u201cM30\u201d pills designed to look like pharmaceutical-grade oxycodone pills, but which evidently don\u2019t contain any real oxycodone. This has predictably resulted in a surge of accidental overdose deaths in the U.S. The CDS as well as other large Mexican cartels have also set up major marijuana growing operations in the remote forests and deserts of California. As of 2021, the Sinaloa Cartel remains Mexico's most dominant drug cartel. After the arrest of Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, the cartel is now headed by Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda and Guzm\u00e1n's sons, Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar, Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and Ivan Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar. However, various sources alleged that internal conflicts for the cartel's leadership had recently broken out between the Guzm\u00e1n and Zambada factions of the organization. The feud between these two sides of the cartel is rumored to have been either initiated or exacerbated by the Battle of Culiac\u00e1n incident when El Mayo reportedly withheld his men from intervening in the conflict between the cartel and the Mexican National Guard after the capture of El Chapo'''s son, Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n. Currently, the \"Federation's\" main rival appears to be the fast-growing Jalisco New Generation Cartel, with most battles between the two groups occurring in the Mexican regions of Baja California, Zacatecas , Sonora and as of recently; Chiapas, over territory for drug trafficking routes. The Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels have reportedly also moved their rivalry to at least five different departments in Colombia according to the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo. The geographic presence of Mexican cartels in Colombia seems to directly coincide with areas where coca crops are more abundant or with strategic narcotrafficking corridors: the Pacific coast of Nari\u00f1o, Catatumbo, Bajo Cauca in Antioquia, Norte del Cauca, and Magdalena. According to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office, an autonomous institution under the Colombian Office of the Attorney General; in the first two months of 2021, violent events displaced more than 11,000 people from their communities within Colombia."

The communities of Port Clements and Sewall are located on the shores of Masset Inlet. The community of Juskatla is located on Juskatla Inlet, the largest of Masset Inlet's arms. There are several islands in the inlet, the largest of which is Kumdis Island, at the inlet's egress to Masset Sound and just north of Port Clements. Masset Inlet helps form the isthmus of the Naikoon Peninsula. According to Walbran Masset Inlet came from the Haida word Masst, meaning \"large island\". Captain Douglas, on his second visit from Nootka Sound aboard the Iphigenia on June 19, 1789 named the bay leading to the inlet McIntyre's Bay. This name was used on the charts of Dixon and Meares. The American traders called the inlet Hancock's River as shown in Ingraham's chart of 1792 after the American brig Hancock. In 1853 H.N. Knox of the Royal Navy, mate on HMS Virago did a sketch survey of the harbour when the name Masset was adopted by the British. A survey was made in 1907 by Captain Learmouth on HMS Egeria."

It also hosts events, owns a publishing firm, and operates several TV shows. Billboard was founded in 1894 by William Donaldson and James Hennegan as a trade publication for bill posters. Donaldson later acquired Hennegan's interest in 1900 for $500. In the early years of the 20th century, it covered the entertainment industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque shows, and also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties."

As a subantarctic volcanic island, it is situated in the South Atlantic Ocean , at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge making it the world's most remote island. It is not part of the southern region covered by the Antarctic Treaty System. The island lies  north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica,  east of the South Sandwich Islands,  south of Gough Island, and  south-southwest of the coast of South Africa. It has an area of , 93\u00a0percent of which is covered by a glacier. The centre of the island is the ice-filled crater of an inactive volcano. Some skerries and one smaller island, Lars\u00f8ya, lie along its coast. Nyr\u00f8ysa, created by a rock slide in the late 1950s, is the only easy place to land and is the location of a weather station. The island was first spotted on 1\u00a0January 1739 by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, during a French exploration mission in the South Atlantic with the ships Aigle and Marie. They did not make landfall. He mislabeled the coordinates for the island, and it was not sighted again until 1808, when the British whaling captain James Lindsay encountered it and named it Lindsay Island. The first claim to have landed on the island was made by the American sailor Benjamin Morrell, although this claim is disputed. In 1825, the island was claimed for the British Crown by George Norris, who named it Liverpool Island. He also reported having sighted another island nearby, which he named Thompson Island, but this was later shown to be a phantom island. In 1927, the first Norvegia expedition landed on the island, and claimed it for Norway. At that point, the island was given its current name of Bouvet Island . In 1930, following resolution of a dispute with the United Kingdom over claiming rights,  it was declared a Norwegian dependency. In 1971, it was designated a nature reserve."

The BBC is established under a royal charter and operates under its agreement with the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport. Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households, companies, and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts and iPlayer catch-up. The fee is set by the British Government, agreed by Parliament, and is used to fund the BBC's radio, TV, and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK. Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service , which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic and Persian. Around a quarter of BBC's revenue comes from its commercial subsidiary BBC Studios , which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC's international 24-hour English-language news services BBC World News, and from BBC.com, provided by BBC Global News Ltd. In 2009, the company was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in recognition of its international achievements. From its inception, through the Second World War , to the popularisation of television in the post-WW2 era and the internet in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the BBC has played a prominent role in British life and culture. It was widely known colloquially as The Beeb, Auntie, or a combination of both ."

The creek was covered in 1898 and today forms part of the Zagreb sewer system. Medve\u0161\u010dak has long served as an important geographical feature of historic Zagreb, delineating the border between the often warring twin cities of Gradec and Kaptol between the 11th and the 19th century and causing many violent floods which often decimated houses on its banks. Most of the stream is located in the Gornji Grad - Medve\u0161\u010dak city district, running underground under Tkal\u010di\u0107eva and Medvedgradska Streets. The creek today plays a minor role in the Zagreb sewer system, having ceased powering the Mandu\u0161evac Fountain in 1882. However, it gave its name to the Medve\u0161\u010dak neighborhood."

The mountains are an important source of alunite, from which alum is extracted. The mineral was discovered there in 1461, and extensively mined until the mine closed in 1941, after almost 500 years; for much of this time it was the principal source of alum in Europe.

At the 2016 census, Gregory had a population of 64 in 83 dwellings. Most of the dwellings are holiday houses. The population of Gregory fluctuates depending on tourism; with the town at full capacity during school holidays and throughout the summer. During the census 50% of dwellings were unoccupied . Port Gregory, formally called Boat Harbour, was established in 1849 and named after brothers Augustus and Frank Gregory, two of Western Australia's most active explorers. In May 1853 sixty convicts and Pensioner Guards arrived from England via Fremantle in the brigantine Leander and the cutter Gold Digger. A townsite was gazetted in 1853 as Pakington near the shore, with Lynton gazetted around the same time as the convict depot and townsite for the guards,  inland on the Hutt River. The convicts were used for Government works and in establishing a road to the Murchison River and the Geraldine lead Mine, operated from 1849 to 1875. Ticket-of-leave men from the depot were hired out for work at the port and on nearby farms and stations. A major employer was Captain William Ayshford Sanford who, as magistrate for the region and the Superintendent of Convicts, built an impressive homestead alongside Lynton. He resigned in 1854 and took up pastoral and whaling pursuits, establishing a whaling facility just north of the Pakington townsite. John Bateman and others also established whaling facilities nearby. The name Pakington was rarely used however and the name Port Gregory, the harbour located next to the town, was more generally accepted. Initially the port was used by whalers and pastoralists and to ship lead ore and pig lead from the mines, notably the Geraldine mine. Salt from nearby Hutt Lagoon was shipped until the depression when the port and both the 'towns' became deserted. On 27 January 1943 the Japanese submarine I-165, while planning to bombard the nearby port of Geraldton, observed three aircraft and what was believed to be a destroyer and aborted the attack. On the following night the submarine bombarded Port Gregory with about ten 100-mm shells from her deck gun, in the belief that a crayfish cannery was an ammunition factory. There was no damage and Port Gregory was at the time deserted. Naval authorities only learned of the attack when the submarine's battle report radio signal was intercepted and decoded a week later. There are many shipwrecks in the vicinity, most caused by the unsuitability of the port for large vessels. These include trading and whaling vessels and the screw steamer SS Xantho, which sank while loaded with lead ore from the Geraldine mine. The town changed its name to Gregory in 1967."

Constructed between 1391 and 1393, it is the only one of the original seven citadel gates to survive mostly intact into the present. Started at the end of the Koryo period in 1391, it was completed three years later under the succeeding Joseon dynasty. It features a stone base topped by a wooden pavilion; however, the pavilion seen today is a 1954 reconstruction as the original was destroyed in 1950 by American bombing during the Korean War. The gate houses the Y\u014fnbok Bell , cast in 1346 and weighing 14 tonnes. Recovered from Y\u014fnbok Temple when it was destroyed by fire in 1563, the bell was used to call out the hours until the early 20th century. The gate is one of the National treasures of North Korea."

NAMA functions as a bad bank, acquiring property development loans from Irish banks in return for government purple debts bonds, ostensibly with a view to improving the availability of credit in the Irish economy. The original book value of these loans was \u20ac77 billion and the original asset values to which the loans related was \u20ac88bn with there being an average Loan To Value of 77% and the current market value is estimated at \u20ac47 billion. NAMA is controversial, with politicians and some economists criticising the approach, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz who has said that the Irish government is \"squandering\" public money with its plan to bail out the banks. One year after NAMA's establishment the Irish government was compelled for other but similar reasons to seek a European Union-International Monetary Fund bailout in November 2010, the outcome of which will have considerable effects on NAMA's future operations. Despite this early criticism, as of year end 2018, NAMA had recovered \u20ac37.4B from its owned assets, and projected that it would eventually generate a net surplus of \u20ac4B. And as of September 2021, NAMA had delivered a total surplus of \u20ac2.75B to the Department of Revenue, and projected that its final net surplus would be \u20ac4.65B."

Sunshades, overhangs, and walls of live greenery filter sunlight and protect interiors from overheating. The gaps between the towers contain terraces with pools and sky gardens. The staggered blocks of the structure's mass are oriented to let the sun pass through the building on its regular course. The apertures through this building are meant to increase the strength of passing breezes and to cool the living units. The architects conceived of this building as a model for high-rise construction in a low-wind tropical climate, reworking the worldwide model developed for cold climates with high winds. The Met has won the 2009 Bronze Emporis Skyscraper Award. WOHA, the architectural firm, won the Singapore President's Design Award - Design of the Year 2009 for The Met. In 2010 the Met won the German \"The International Highrise Award\" and was cited for \"sustainable living conditions in this tropical region without recourse to air conditioning\".

The house was constructed circa 1860, although its precise date of erection \u2014 as well as the names of its first owner and its designer \u2014 is unknown.  Its five-bay, -long exterior is decorated with cornices around the window lintels.  Inside, the rooms open onto a central hallway that concludes with a stairway to the second floor of the central part of the house. In 1974, the Monitor House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its unusual architecture.  Only two or three monitor houses, featuring an elevated center, are known to exist in Ohio, and the one in St. Paris is architecturally the most well-preserved; consequently, it is considered historically significant statewide.  In contrast, a similar monitor house in Chillicothe, known as \"Tanglewood,\" is only considered locally significant.  The house in St. Paris was the first of over thirty places in Champaign County to be listed on the National Register; it is one of two in the village with this distinction, along with the Kiser Mansion on East Main Street."

During the Liberian Civil War, many pilots of Russian and Ukrainian origin stayed at the hotel.  In the 1980s the hotel was owned by British-Liberian businessman Michael Doe. On 5 August, 1990, the INPFL kidnapped the manager Doe, two Lebanese, and two Liberians at the Hotel Africa, later murdering Michael Doe, throwing him off the 4th floor balcony. A South African consortium had plans to invest US$100 million to renovate the historic hotel in time for Liberia's hosting duties of an international women's colloquium in 2009."

        "content": "After the division of Korea, Japan and South Korea established diplomatic relations in December 1965, under the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, with Japan recognizing South Korea as the only legitimate government of the whole Korean peninsula. Japan and South Korea are neighbors, and they are both main allies of the United States in East Asia. Despite this, the relationship between the two states has greatly deteriorated in recent years, characterized by strong mutual distrust and a number of disputes. These disputes include: territorial claims on Liancourt Rocks , Japanese prime ministers' visits to Yasukuni Shrine, differing views on Imperial Japan's treatment of colonial Korea, and Japan's refusal to negotiate Korea's demands that it apologize or pay reparations for mistreatment of World War II comfort women from Korea. The Diplomatic Bluebook of Japan by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in 2018 removed the phrase present in the previous year referring to the ROK as \"Japan's most important neighbor that shares strategic interests with Japan.\" In 2021, South Korea dropped its description of Japan as a \"partner\" in its latest defense white paper. These tensions have complicated American efforts to promote a common front against Chinese threats in the region. According to a 2014 BBC World Service poll, 13% of Japanese view South Korea's influence positively, with 37% expressing a negative view, while 15% of South Koreans view Japanese influence positively, with 79% expressing negatively, making South Korea, after China, the country with the second most negative perception of Japan in the world. Due to the highly antagonistic nature of the relationship, the two countries have been described as being in a state of \"cold war\" by various media commentators."

        "content": "Varany Maha Vidyalayam is a provincial school in Varany, Sri Lanka. Locating the school at Varany was due to the untiring efforts of V. Sithamparanathan who was a towering figure at Varany Village Council for 30 years, the last 18 as Chairman. Constructing a secondary school in the southern part of Thenmaradchi District was mooted by V. Kumarasamy the then Member of Parliament for Chavakachcheri, with a decision resulting in selecting Kodikamam as the venue. Even construction materials began arriving at the site when Mr. Sithamparanathan took it upon himself as a crusader to build the secondary school at Varany instead. Kodikamam is located at a main railway station with good road and rail access to established schools in Chavakachcheri, only 5 miles away. Even better schools in Jaffna town were equally accessible by rail or road to students in that vicinity. Such was not the case with Varany, a village of much larger land area with a predominantly agrarian base. For historical reasons such as resisting educational developments based on religious lines, Varany residents did not take to western education like the rest of the peninsula. When the winds of change blew a bit harder, it became apparent to leaders like Mr. Sithamparanathan that unless education was built into the future fabric of life, Varany residents would be left behind. There were several vernacular and primary schools in the village, including the American Mission Tamil Mixed School which was built through the philanthropy of Mr. Sithamparanathan himself, partly as a compromise for not allowing the construction of a secondary school in Varany by the missionaries who then took the project to Udupiddy in the form of the current Udupiddy American Mission College. Students from Varany had to trek long distances by foot to get to the main road, take buses or vans to either Point Pedro or to Kodikamam and take another bus or van to Chavakachcheri if they aspired to higher education. A few would even go further to schools in the Jaffna town enduring even more hardship. Locating a secondary school in a location central to the Village Council's boundaries so that the catchment is equitably served in terms of travel distance was a key consideration. The visionaries of the time would have been very pleased to see the fruits of their labour in ample supply as evidenced in the publication of the school's 50th Anniversary Commemoration in 2004."

One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' \"Stories\" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with \"Discover\", letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to keep photos in the \"my eyes only\" which lets them keep their photos in a password-protected space. It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future. Snapchat was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University. It has become known for representing a new, mobile-first direction for social media, and places significant emphasis on users interacting with virtual stickers and augmented reality objects. As of July 2021, Snapchat had 293 million daily active users, a 23% growth over a year. On average more than four billion Snaps are sent each day. Snapchat is popular among the younger generations, particularly those below the age of 16, leading to many privacy concerns for parents."

The basic exhibition located in the basement of the main building, stresses the impact of human life in the nature of the archipelagos by describing the initial colonization of the barren areas, as well as of the introduction of agrarian occupation. In addition to the maritime occupation such as seal hunting, fishery and seabird hunting, also coastal navigation and pilotage are presented in the exhibition. The boat occupies the central position in being the prime tool of the population. The upper floor of the main building presents an exhibition of wooden boats and boat building. Here we find work boats and boats of bygone days, as well as a presentation of wooden boat building along clinker and cravel-techniques. In addition to permanent exhibitions here mentioned the museum annually presents a selected theme connected to the maritime culture. In the wooden shed, opposite the main building, the visitor will find a collection of marine engines, inboard as well as outboard, possibly the most important in Finland. The upper floor of this shed houses an exhibition on summer life in the skerries in bygone days including pleasure boats.

Signed and dated 1654, it is now in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague, Netherlands. The work is a trompe-l'\u0153il oil on panel measuring  that was once part of a larger structure, perhaps a window jamb or a protective cover. It is possible that the painting was in its creator's workshop in Delft at the time of the gunpowder explosion that killed him and destroyed much of the city. A common and colourful bird with a pleasant song, the goldfinch was a popular pet, and could be taught simple tricks including lifting a thimble-sized bucket of water. It was reputedly a bringer of good health, and was used in Italian Renaissance painting as a symbol of Christian redemption and the Passion of Jesus. The Goldfinch is unusual for the Dutch Golden Age painting period in the simplicity of its composition and use of illusionary techniques. Following the death of its creator, it was lost for more than two centuries before its rediscovery in Brussels. It plays a central role in the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt and its film adaptation."
