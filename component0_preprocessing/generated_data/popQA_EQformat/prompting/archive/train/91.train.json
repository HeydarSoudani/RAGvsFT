They drove across the United States searching for Miramax representatives and demonstrated their discontent with certain aspects of the script they had acquired, with a major point of criticism being that the script ended with Mitnick's conviction to serve a long-term prison sentence, while in reality, at the time of Freedom Downtime's production, Mitnick had not yet even had a trial but nonetheless was incarcerated for five years without bail in a high-security facility."
