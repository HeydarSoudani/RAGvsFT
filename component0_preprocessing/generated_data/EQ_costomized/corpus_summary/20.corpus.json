When Descartes moved back from Amsterdam to Deventer the following winter, Helena went with him. Although Francine was referred to as an illegitimate child, her baptism in Deventer on 7 August 1635, was recorded among the legitimate births. Helena officially remained Descartes' servant, and Ren\u00e9 referred to Francine as his niece, but both were included in his life. In 1640 Descartes wrote that he would bring his daughter to France to learn the language and be educated, but before that could happen, Francine died of scarlet fever at the age of five. Russell Shorto postulated that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes' work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.Helena was the only woman with whom Descartes is known to have been intimate and she and Descartes appear to have remained close after Francine's death. Helena may have moved with Descartes to his next addresses \u2014 including in 1643 to Egmond-Binnen \u2014 where in 1644 she married the local innkeeper Jan Jansz van Wel.  Notary acts discovered by Jeroen van de Ven show that Descartes provided the 1000-guilder dowry for this wedding. Descartes himself would remain in Egmond-Binnen until 1649, the longest period he ever stayed at any residence.\nFrancine had four half brothers through her mother, Helena:\n\nJustinus Jansz van Wel, son of Jan Jansz van Wel, Helena's first husband,\nJan van Lienen,\nWouter van Lienen and\nWillem van Lienen from Helena's second husband, Jacob van Lienen.After Francine's death, Ren\u00e9 Descartes is said to have constructed an automaton in her likeness."

He was responsible for the health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll.\nIn 1947 Warren became the first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although controversial and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out about the dangers of nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion leading up to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine."

Her feast day is on 3 January.\nRecognized for her religious devotion at a young age, she met Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes when she was a child and dedicated herself to a virginal life. Miracles and healings began to happen around her early on and she became to be known for changing the weather. She moved from Nanterre, her hometown, to Paris, after her parents died and became known for her piety, healings, and miracles, although the residents of Paris resented her and would have killed her if not for Germanus' interventions. Her prayers saved Paris from being destroyed by the Huns under Attila in 451 and other wars; her organisation of the city's women was called a \"prayer marathon\" and Genevieve's \"most famous feat\". She was involved in two major construction projects in Paris, a basilica in the honour of Saint Denis of Paris in 475 and the Basilica of the Holy Apostles, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, in c. 500.\nGenevieve performed miracles both before and after her death. She was recognized as the patron saint of Paris in the 14th century. She was \"a favorite of both the humblest residents and of the Bourbon family, and was equally venerated by Erasmus and revolutionary fishwives\" and was considered \"a cultural symbol which Parisians shared, appropriated, negotiated, and used according to specific communal assumptions and traditions\".Genevieve was publicly invoked during emergencies related to the needs and expectations of the residents of Paris 153 times between 885 and October 1791, ranging from spontaneous and less-ritualized invocations and processions with her reliquary during the Middle Ages to highly ritualized ones said before her unveiled reliquary in the years leading up to the French Revolution. As times and conditions changed in Paris, so did the ways in which Genevieve was invoked and processed. As new calamities threatened the city and new intercessions to her were needed, new associations, images, and metaphors were required. Her cult remained popular throughout the history of Paris, although her cult has never returned to its pre-Revolutionary popularity and unifying status."

McCay experimented with the formal elements of the comic strip page, arranging and sizing panels to increase impact and enhance the narrative. McCay also produced numerous detailed editorial cartoons and was a popular performer of chalk talks on the vaudeville circuit.\nMcCay was an early animation pioneer; between 1911 and 1921 he self-financed and animated ten films, some of which survive only as fragments. The first three served in his vaudeville act; Gertie the Dinosaur was an interactive routine in which McCay appeared to give orders to a trained dinosaur. McCay and his assistants worked for twenty-two months on his most ambitious film, The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918), a patriotic recreation of the German torpedoing in 1915 of the RMS Lusitania. Lusitania did not enjoy as much commercial success as the earlier films, and McCay's later movies attracted little attention. His animation, vaudeville, and comic strip work was gradually curtailed as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, his employer since 1911, expected McCay to devote his energies to editorial illustrations.\nIn his drawing, McCay made bold, prodigious use of linear perspective, particularly in detailed architecture and cityscapes. He textured his editorial cartoons with copious fine hatching, and made color a central element in Little Nemo. His comic strip work has influenced generations of cartoonists and illustrators. The technical level of McCay's animation\u2014its naturalism, smoothness, and scale\u2014was unmatched until the work of Fleischer Studios in the late 1920s, followed by Walt Disney's feature films in the 1930s. He pioneered inbetweening, the use of registration marks, cycling, and other animation techniques that were to become standard."

He also was the President of Greece under the junta in 1973, following a referendum. However, after the effective suppression of the Athens Polytechnic uprising, he was, in turn, overthrown by hardliner Dimitrios Ioannidis, in a string of events that would culminate to the fall of the regime in 1974. His and the dictatorship's legacy, as well as its methods he constructed and effects on Greek economy and society as a whole, are still fiercely debated. \nHe joined the Hellenic Army during the Second World War and resisted the Greco-Italian War; in so doing he obtained honors and became a hero. He remained in the army after the war and rose to the rank of colonel.\nIn April 1967, Papadopoulos and a group of other mid-level army officers overthrew the democratic government and established a military junta that lasted until 1974. Assuming dictatorial powers, he led an authoritarian, anti-communist and ultranationalist regime which eventually ended the Greek monarchy and established a republic, with himself as president. In 1973, he was overthrown and arrested by his co-conspirator Brigadier General Dimitrios Ioannidis. After the Metapolitefsi which restored democracy in 1974, Papadopoulos was tried for his part in the crimes of the junta and sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Refusing several offers of clemency in exchange for admitting guilt for the crimes of the junta, he spent the remainder of his life in prison."

In 1908 he travelled abroad to Naples, where he continued his studies at the Naples Conservatory with composer Martucci Dworczak. He was employed as an opera coach in Milan in 1910. Later, he toured Europe as a concert violinist and conducted operas throughout Europe and, later, the US.\nCarbonara began his film music career at the end of the silent film era. In the 1930s and 1940s he scored numerous films at Paramount Pictures, including American Empire, The Shepherd of the Hills, as well as a series of Mutt and Jeff cartoons (with co-composer James Bradford). Carbonara composed several cues for Stagecoach (1939), but did not receive screen credit because of a clause in his contract. Although the score, which featured the music of several composers, won an Oscar, Carbonara was not counted among the winners. However, he was nominated for The Kansan in 1943. In the 1940s, especially after World War II, he composed and arranged music for short films. Carbonara often worked closely with his colleague John Leipold.\nIn addition to his film scores Carbonara's oeuvre includes many serious works, among them an opera (\"Armand\"), individual pieces for solo piano (\"Danse Fantastique\", \"Rhapsodie\", \"Hollywood Boulevard\", \"An American Tone Sketch\", \"Minuet\" and \"Petite Valse\"), duos for violin and piano (\"Aria\", \"Serenata Gotica\", \"Alla Tarantella\" and \"Dusk\") and symphony orchestra (\"Ode to Nature\", \"Concerto Orientale\" and \"Scherzetto Fantasia\")."

The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. As George's wife, she was also Electress of Hanover until becoming Queen of Hanover on 12 October 1814. Charlotte was Britain's longest-serving queen consort, serving for 57 years and 70 days.\nCharlotte was born into the ruling family of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, a duchy in northern Germany. In 1760, the young and unmarried George III inherited the British throne. As Charlotte was a minor German princess with no interest in politics, George considered her a suitable consort, and they married in 1761. The marriage lasted 57 years and produced 15 children, 13 of whom survived to adulthood. They included two future British monarchs, George IV and William IV; as well as Charlotte, Princess Royal, who became Queen of W\u00fcrttemberg; and Prince Ernest Augustus, who became King of Hanover.\n\nCharlotte was a patron of the arts and an amateur botanist who helped expand Kew Gardens. She introduced the Christmas tree to Britain, decorating one for a Christmas party for children of Windsor in 1800. She was distressed by her husband's bouts of physical and mental illness, which became permanent in later life. She maintained a close relationship with Queen Marie Antoinette of France, and the French Revolution is likely to have enhanced the emotional strain felt by Charlotte. Her eldest son, George, was appointed prince regent in 1811 due to the increasing severity of the King's illness. Charlotte died in November 1818, with her son George at her side. George III died a little over a year later, probably unaware of his wife's death."

He served in the State Legislature of Connecticut in 1790, 1792, and 1794\u20111805, serving as Clerk of the House 1800\u20111802 and as Speaker 1803\u20111805. He was elected as a Federalist to the United States Congress in the Ninth Congress to fill in part the vacancies caused by the resignations of Calvin Goddard and Roger Griswold; and was re-elected to the Tenth and to the five succeeding Congresses, thus serving from September 16, 1805, to March 3, 1819.\nPitkin was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.He was not a candidate for renomination to the federal Congress in 1818, but was a delegate to the convention which framed the new state constitution in that year. Resuming his private law practice, he also returned to serve as a member of the Connecticut state House of Representatives from 1819 to 1830. His writing on and gathering of statistical materials are the accomplishments which accord him a special place in the history of the United States. Written with great care, A Statistical View of the Commerce of the United States of America (1816) and Political and Civil History of the United States from 1763 to the Close of Washington's Administration (2 volumes, 1828) are valuable reference works for students of American history. He is buried in New Haven, in Grove Street Cemetery.\nHe was the maternal uncle of Roger Sherman Baldwin's wife Emily Pitkin Perkins."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Wilmington Quicksteps, Kansas City Cowboys, Philadelphia Quakers, Chicago White Stockings, Chicago Pirates, Cincinnati Kelly's Killers, and Philadelphia Phillies.\nDebuting with the Wilmington Quicksteps in 1884, Bastian played just 17 games before moving on to Union Association rival Kansas City Cowboys, where he tallied another eleven. After the demise of the UA, Bastian signed with the Philadelphia Quakers of the National League. He became the club's everyday shortstop, playing 103 games but hitting only .167 with 4 home runs and 29 RBI. He also led the league in strikeouts with 82. Despite this, in 1886, Bastian became the regular second baseman for the Quakers. His production increased a bit as he hit .217 with 2 home runs and 38 RBI, and he placed in the league's top ten in triples. However, as his offense was still subpar, Bastian lost his starting job for 1887, remaining with the team as a utility infielder that season and the next.\nThe Chicago White Stockings (predecessors of the Cubs) were Bastian's next stop, as they purchased him from Philadelphia. With the Cubs, Bastian's performance bottomed out. He batted a career-low .135 and played in just 46 games. Bastian jumped to the fledgling Players' League in 1890, signing with the Chicago Pirates, where he was once again an everyday shortstop. However, his lack of offensive production continued to plague him, as Bastian failed to hit .200 for a third consecutive season.\nBastian played a game each for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers and his old Philadelphia Quakers, now the Philadelphia Phillies, in 1891 before hanging up his glove after his final appearance on August 22. In a 504-game career, Bastian hit just .189 with eleven home runs and 144 RBI.\nBastian died on January 18, 1932, in Pennsauken, New Jersey."

        "content": "William Burges  (; 2 December 1827 \u2013 20 April 1881) was an English architect and designer. Among the greatest of the Victorian art-architects, he sought in his work to escape from both nineteenth-century industrialisation and the Neoclassical architectural style and re-establish the architectural and social values of a utopian medieval England. Burges stands within the tradition of the Gothic Revival, his works echoing those of the Pre-Raphaelites and heralding those of the Arts and Crafts movement.\nBurges's career was short but illustrious; he won his first major commission for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork in 1863 when he was 35. He died in 1881 at his Kensington home,  The Tower House aged only 53. His architectural output was small but varied. Working with a long-standing team of craftsmen, he built churches, a cathedral, a warehouse, a university, a school, houses and castles.\nBurges's most notable works are Cardiff Castle, constructed between 1866 and 1928, and Castell Coch (1872\u201391), both of which were built for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Other significant buildings include Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire (1858\u201365), Knightshayes Court (1867\u201374), the Church of Christ the Consoler (1870\u201376), St Mary's, Studley Royal (1870\u201378), in Yorkshire, and Park House, Cardiff (1871\u201380).\nMany of his designs were never executed or were subsequently demolished or altered. His competition entries for cathedrals at Lille (1854), Adelaide (1856), Colombo, Brisbane (1859), Edinburgh (1873), and Truro (1878) were all unsuccessful. He lost out to George Edmund Street in the competition for the Royal Courts of Justice (1866\u201367) in The Strand. His plans for the redecoration of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral (1870\u201377) were abandoned and he was dismissed from his post. Skilbeck's Warehouse (1865\u201366) was demolished in the 1970s, and work at Salisbury Cathedral (1855\u201359), Worcester College, Oxford (1873\u201379), and at Knightshayes Court had been lost in the decades before.\nBeyond architecture, Burges designed metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, furniture and stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, a series of lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. The revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century led to a renewed appreciation of Burges and his work."

Among the important international venues at which he sang were La Scala, Milan, (in 1923-26) and the New York Metropolitan Opera (in 1923-25). Additionally, in 1926, he had the honour of creating the role of Calaf in Puccini's posthumously-premiered final opera, Turandot, at the insistence of La Scala's principal conductor, Arturo Toscanini. But this taxing dramatic role took him to the limit of his resources and he did not attempt it again.\nFleta made his operatic debut in Trieste in 1919, having previously studied voice at the Madrid conservatory. Successful engagements in Rome followed, leading to his La Scala and Met debuts. He quit the Met in acrimonious circumstances, however, and the resultant legal action stopped him performing again in the United States.\nHe was celebrated during his best years for the finesse with which he used his rich, flexible voice. The most notable aspect of his performance style was the nimbleness of his bel canto technique. This enabled him to produce spectacular messa di voce and pianissimo effects. Unfortunately, Fleta's singing became increasingly self-indulgent as his career progressed. By the late 1920s, as recordings show, his voice had deteriorated badly, with his vibrato loosening to an undesirable extent.\nFleta died in straitened circumstances in 1938. He nonetheless left a legacy of sometimes fascinating records, many of which are available on CD reissues."

        "content": "William Ganz (January 7, 1919 \u2013 November 10, 2009) was a Slovakia-born American cardiologist who co-invented the pulmonary artery catheter, often referred to as the Swan-Ganz catheter, with Jeremy Swan in 1970.  The catheter is used to monitor heart conditions, especially in intensive care units.  Ganz was also one of the first cardiologists to use enzymes to open clogged arteries, which can lead to heart attacks.Ganz was born in Kosice, Czechoslovakia, located in modern-day Slovakia, in 1919. He enrolled at the Charles University School of Medicine in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1938. The school was closed in 1940 following the start of Nazi Germany's occupation Czechoslovakia.  Ganz, who was Jewish, was sent to a Nazi labor camp in Hungary during World War II. He was scheduled to be sent to Auschwitz in 1944, but escaped and went into hiding. After World War II, Ganz graduated from Charles University in 1947 at the top of his class.Ganz worked in Czechoslovakia, which was under Communist rule at the time.  In 1966, Ganz was permitted to take his wife, Magda, and the couple's two sons on a vacation to Italy. Instead, the family went to Vienna, Austria, where they applied for a visa to the United States. He had relatives in Los Angeles, which allowed the family to move to the United States.  Ganz gained a position at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he remained for the rest of his career.Ganz and Dr. Jeremy Swan first developed the idea for the pulmonary artery catheter in 1970.  A balloon is placed at the end of a flexible catheter, which is inserted into the pulmonary artery.  Additionally, Ganz had a role in the development of thrombolysis, in which enzymes break down blood clots.Ganz died of natural causes on November 11, 2009, at the age of 90.  He was survived by his sons, Dr. Peter Ganz, a cardiologist at UCSF, and Dr. Tomas Ganz, a pulmonologist at UCLA.  His wife, Magda Ganz, died in 2005.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Walter Franklin Bond (October 19, 1937 \u2013 September 14, 1967) was an American professional baseball player who appeared in 365 games over six Major League Baseball seasons between 1960 and 1967 for the Cleveland Indians, Houston Colt .45s/Astros and Minnesota Twins. An outfielder and first baseman, he played the last five seasons of his 11-year professional career after being diagnosed with leukemia while serving in the United States Army in 1962. Bond died of the disease in the closing weeks of the 1967 baseball season \u2014 a year during which he had made the Twins' roster coming out of spring training.\nThe native of Denmark, Tennessee, attended Lane College; he stood 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighed 228 pounds (103 kg), threw right-handed and batted left-handed. With his imposing size, he was an effective power hitter who also batted for average (.299) during his minor league career, and brief Negro leagues career with the Kansas City Monarchs. In 1962, the year of his diagnosis, Bond batted .320 in 132 games for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Then, in a 12-game September stint with the Indians, Bond hit six home runs in only 50 at bats, drove in 17 runs, batted .380 and slugged .800.  Yet he could not make the 1963 Indians roster and spent that campaign in Triple-A.\nOn December 19, 1963, he was acquired by Houston. The Colt .45s' general manager, Paul Richards, was aware of Bond's illness, but the team doctor examined Bond and determined his leukemia was in remission.  Bond then turned in his best major league season as the starting first baseman for the 1964 Colt .45s, leading Houston in home runs (20) and runs batted in (85), and appearing in 148 games. The following year, Bond held onto his starting job, but his production slumped with the team's move into the Astrodome; some teammates later speculated that his leukemia had recurred that season, affecting his play. Sent to the Twins just before the 1966 season, he returned to Triple-A and batted .316 with 18 home runs in 122 games for the Denver Bears, earning an invitation to spring training for 1967.\nBond made the team and batted .313 in part-time duty during the season's first month. His five hits included a two-run, pinch-hit home run against 20-game-winner Earl Wilson of the Detroit Tigers on April 23. However, the Twins released him on May 15, and although Bond caught on with the Triple-A Jacksonville Suns, his declining health forced him to the sidelines after only three games. He entered a Houston hospital for treatment, amd he died there on September 14, 1967, a month short of turning 30.  Said his physician, Dr. Hatch Cummings: \"He showed the strength of character and will that only champions possess. It was an exhibition of courage, and in the best tradition of baseball.\"Among Bond's 307 big-league hits were 40 doubles, 11 triples and 41 homers. He was credited with 179 runs batted in."

He is best known for his opposition to poverty, social exclusion and the Mafia in Sicily, and is considered to be one of the protagonists of the non-violence movement in Italy. He became known as the \"Gandhi of Sicily\".In the 1950s and 1960s, Dolci published a series of books (notably, in their English translations, To Feed the Hungry, 1955, and Waste, 1960) that stunned the outside world with their emotional force and the detail with which he depicted the desperate conditions of the Sicilian countryside and the power of the Mafia. Dolci became a kind of cult hero in the United States and Northern Europe; he was idolised, in particular by idealistic youngsters, and support committees were formed to raise funds for his projects.In 1958 he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize, despite being an explicit non-communist. He was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), which in 1947 received the Nobel Peace Prize along with the British Friends Service Council, now called Quaker Peace and Social Witness, on behalf of all Quakers worldwide. Among those who publicly voiced support for his efforts were Carlo Levi, Erich Fromm, Bertrand Russell, Jean Piaget, Aldous Huxley, Jean-Paul Sartre and Ernst Bloch. In Sicily, Leonardo Sciascia advocated many of his ideas. In the United States his proto-Christian idealism was absurdly confused with communism. He was also a recipient of the 1989 Jamnalal Bajaj International Award of the Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation of India."

Three versions of his compilation, and one later, less extensive manuscript, have been preserved.\nNot only did Mair spend huge sums on his collections and on his projects, he also had a very expensive lifestyle, frequently hosting receptions for the more important burghers of Augsburg. His own income was not sufficient for this, and during many years, he misappropriated funds from the city treasury, with the supervision of which he had been entrusted since 1541. His embezzlements were discovered in 1579, and Mair was hanged as a thief at the age of 62."

Taylor was born in on May 17, 1853, in Ottawa, Canada West, and came to Edmonton in 1877. Shortly after his arrival in Edmonton, Taylor established the first telegraph, telephone, and electricity systems. Taylor asked the Bell Telephone Company to provide services in 1883. Alex Taylor, Dominion Telegraph Agent, brought the first two telephones made of Spanish mahogany, and asked store owner Henry William McKenney of St. Albert to keep the device in St. Albert. Taylor, who, at the time was working for the Dominion Telegraph and Signal Service proposed running a telephone line from his office to St. Albert, Alberta.  January 3, 1885, the two tested the line, the first successful call in Northern Alberta. He founded Edmonton's first telephone company and made Edmonton's first telephone call. In 1892, Taylor installed a switchboard and Jennie Lauder became Edmonton's first telephone operator overseeing a system of 14 telephones. In 1893, the Edmonton District Telephone Company  was granted a charter and less than a decade later it was operational 24 hours a day and provided service to nearby rural areas.\nIn 1891, Taylor co-founded Edmonton's first electric company, the Edmonton Electric Lighting and Power Company. Taylor also co-founded Edmonton's first newspaper, the Edmonton Bulletin with Frank Oliver in 1880. Taylor also served on the Edmonton Public School Board from 1899 to 1909, and was the chairman of the board in 1907.In 1904, ill health prompted Taylor to sell his telephone company to the City of Edmonton for $17,000, which later became known as Edmonton Telephones. Taylor died on February 12, 1916. He is buried in the Edmonton Cemetery.\n\n\n== References =="

His philosophy was of the Muslim Peripatetic school derived from Aristotelianism.His most famous works are The Book of Healing, a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, and The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650. Besides philosophy and medicine, Avicenna's corpus includes writings on astronomy, alchemy, geography and geology, psychology, Islamic theology, logic, mathematics, physics, and works of poetry.Avicenna wrote most of his philosophical and scientific works in Arabic, but also wrote several key works in Persian, while his poetic works were written in both languages. Of the 450 works  he is believed to have written, around 240 have survived, including 150 on philosophy and 40 on medicine."

        "content": "Louis Klopsche Finney (August 13, 1910 \u2013 April 22, 1966) was an American professional baseball player. He spent fifteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) playing for the Philadelphia Athletics (1931; 1933\u20131939), Boston Red Sox (1939\u20131942; 1944\u201345), St. Louis Browns (1945\u201346), and Philadelphia Phillies (1947) as an outfielder and first baseman.\nBorn in Buffalo, in Chambers County, Alabama, the left-handed-batting Finney stood 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall and weighed 180 lb (82 kg). Finney was of Scotch-Irish descent; he was named in memory of Louis Klopsch, a German-American immigrant and founder of The Christian Herald magazine, who died in 1910.  An older brother, Hal, was also a Major League player, a catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nLou Finney's professional baseball career began in the minor leagues in 1930; the next season, he was called up to the pennant-bound Athletics in September, and he batted .375 in nine games\u2014including back-to-back three-hit outings against the Cleveland Indians on September 14\u201315.  He did not appear in the 1931 World Series, which Philadelphia lost to the St. Louis Cardinals, and spent 1932 with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, batting .351 with 268 hits.\nFinney then split 1933 between the Athletics, getting into 74 games as a back-up outfielder, and the top-level Montreal Royals of the International League.  In 1934, he made the Athletics for good, but the Mackmen were beginning a 13-year streak of futility that would see them plummet to the bottom of the American League standings nine times, including 1935, 1936 and 1938.  Finney was the club's regular first baseman in both 1936 and 1938, batting .302 with 197 hits in the former year.\nThen, on May 8, 1939, his contract was purchased by the first division Red Sox.  With Boston, Finney benefited from the batting tips offered by Hall of Famer Hugh Duffy, a veteran Red Sox scout and hitting instructor.  He hit .325 in part-time service in 1939, then took over as the Red Sox' regular right fielder in 1940, with Ted Williams shifting to left field. Finney batted .320 with 171 hits, and was named to the 1940 American League All-Star Team.\nFinney held onto the Red Sox' right-fielder job in both 1941 and 1942, although his batting average dipped below .290 each season. With World War II raging, he spent the 1943 campaign working his Alabama farm before returning to the Majors for two full seasons (1944\u201345) and parts of 1946 and 1947.\nIn 15 Major League seasons, Finney played in 1,270 games and had 4,631 at bats, 643 runs scored, 1,329 hits, 203 doubles, 85 triples, 31 home runs, 494 runs batted in, 39 stolen bases, 329 bases on balls, a .287 batting average, .336 on-base percentage, .388 slugging percentage, 1,795 total bases and 63 sacrifice hits. He led the American League in at bats (653) in 1936 and finished 29th in voting for the 1940 American League MVP Award for leading the AL in at bats per strikeout (41.1)\nFinney played and managed in minor league baseball after his final stint in MLB with the 1947 Phillies.  He died from coronary thrombosis in LaFayette, Alabama, at the age of 55."

In 1911 he acquired the Ch\u00e2teau de Mivoisin, a 36 square kilometre property located 1\u00bd hours south of Paris in Dammarie-sur-Loing, Loiret.\nIn 1941, Boussac was made a member of the National Council of Vichy France.\nIn 1946, he financed Christian Dior's new Paris fashion house that became one of the most famous clothing and perfume marques. In 1951 Boussac expanded into the newspaper business with the acquisition of L'Aurore.\nAn avid horseman, Marcel Boussac acquired the Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard horse breeding farm in Neuvy-au-Houlme in Lower Normandy and the Haras de Jardy in Marnes-la-Coquette. As part of his breeding operation, Boussac bought and sold horses from across Europe plus from the United States. He acquired the U.S. Triple Crown winner Whirlaway and sold the mare La Troienne to Edward R. Bradley's Idle Hour Stock Farm in Lexington, Kentucky who became one of the most influential mares to be imported into the U.S. in the 20th century.\nBoussac's horses, carrying Boussac's signature orange silk and grey cap, dominated French horse racing from the 1930s through to the 1960s making his stable the leading money winner fourteen times and the leading breeder on seventeen occasions. In addition to being a six-time winner of France's most important race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Boussac's horses also won the prestigious Epsom Derby, Epsom Oaks, 2,000 Guineas, St. Leger Stakes, Ascot Gold Cup and others in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the Fall of France in the Second World War, Boussac paid a British Royal Air Force officer on secret business to fly him from Paris to the UK. This caused the officer Sidney Cotton to be removed from his position. During the German occupation of France in World War II, the Nazis seized some of the best racehorses in the country. They shipped more than six hundred of them out of the country, some to Hungary but most back to Germany for racing or for breeding at the German National Stud. Among them was the champion Pharis, owned by Marcel Boussac.\nHe was married for many years to the Belgian opera singer Fanny Heldy. They are buried together in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.\nOn his death in 1980, Boussac's estate was liquidated and L'Aurore sold to Robert Hersant who merged it with his Le Figaro newspaper. The property itself would eventually be acquired by Stavros Niarchos. The Aga Khan IV had purchased the bulk of the Boussac farm's breeding stock in 1978 when Boussac's companies were declared bankrupt.In his honor, the Prix Marcel Boussac, a Group One Stakes Race, is run annually at the Longchamp Racecourse."

Manuha ruled Thaton from 1030s until 1057 when he was defeated by King Anawrahta of Pagan Kingdom.:\u200a150\u200a According to the Mon tradition, Manuha was the 59th in the line of kings who supposedly founded Thaton during the time of the Buddha in the 6th century BCE.\nTraditional Burmese and Mon reconstructions also hold that Anawrahta, a recent convert to Theravada Buddhism, asked for the Theravada Buddhist canon from Manuha. The Mon king reputedly rejected Anawrahta's request, saying that the uncultured Burmans of the north were not worthy of the religion. This refusal was used by Anawrahta as pretense to invade and conquer the Mon kingdom. Despite this account, it is more likely Anawrahta conquered Thaton in order to check the westward advance of Khmer Empire in the Tenasserim coast. Still according to traditional belief, Manuha and his family along with some 30,000 monks and artisans, were brought back to Pagan (Bagan). Between 1050 and about 1085, Mon craftsmen and artisans helped to build some two thousand monuments at Pagan, the remains of which today rival the splendors of Angkor Wat.However, recent research\u2014still a minority view\u2014argues that Mon influence on the interior after Anawrahta's conquest is a greatly exaggerated post-Pagan legend, and that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan's expansion. Historian Michael Aung-Thwin (Aung-Thwin 2005) argues that the existence of Thaton is not supported by contemporary evidence.Manuha asked and was allowed to build the Manuha Temple in Pagan in 1059. Inside the temple three giant Buddha statues\u2014two sitting, and one reclining\u2014seem too large for their enclosures, and their cramped, uncomfortable positions are said to represent the stress and lack of comfort the 'captive king' had to endure."

In 1933 he had to flee from the Nazis, first to Portugal, then to Barcelona, where he worked as a chemist until 1938. He spent World War II in France, either in prison or hiding.

This piece, subtitled Zw\u00f6lftondauer-Komplexe (twelve-tone-duration complexes), was published in 1925 in Berlin, but was possibly written as early as 1914. It makes use of various 12-note and 12-duration complexes, making it one of the earliest pieces of music composed using a variant of twelve-tone technique, and predating Olivier Messiaen's work. There are five movements, four provided with titles referencing their dynamics:\n\nMezzo-forte (Largo)\nFortissimo (Allegro)\nPiano (Andante)\nPianissimo (Allegretto)\nAdagio (Adagio)The dynamics in the last movement are left to the performers to decide on. Copies of the archival score can be ordered directly from Robert Lienau, the original publishers of the work.\nThe rest of Golyshev's compositional output, which included two operas, romances, music for Vsevolod Pudovkin's lost film Igdenbu the Great Hunter, a string quartet and other pieces, is lost.\nGolyshev provided illustrations for Sensorialit\u00e9 Excentrique, the last book published by Raoul Hausmann in 1970."

Ibn Ammar was reputed to be unbeatable at chess; according to Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi, his victory in a game convinced Alfonso VI of Castile to turn away from Seville.\nHe engineered the annexation of the taifa of Murcia to the kingdom of Seville, and convinced al-Mu'tamid to name him as its governor. He proclaimed himself its king and cut off relations with al-Mu'tamid. He soon fell from power, was captured in an ambush, and was imprisoned in Seville. Al-Mu'tamid was initially inclined to forgiveness, but was later incensed by something he read in an intercepted letter sent by Ibn Ammar from his prison cell.

        "content": "Riccardo Francovich (Florence, Italy, 10 June 1946 \u2013 Fiesole, Italy, 30 March 2007) was a pioneering Italian archaeologist and expert on Medieval Italy.\nThe son of Carlo Francovich, Francovich was a professor of Medieval archaeology first at the University of Florence and, then, from 1986 until his death in 2007, at the University of Siena. Many would consider him one of the most influential and important archaeologists of Medieval Italy.\nFrancovich was a pioneer in the world of Italian archaeology. He trained himself in big-scale excavation. He was also one of the first archaeologists to utilize many British methods to his field practice. He was a skilled maker of archaeological parks. In this last task he experienced contrasting results. The park he made at Montarrenti never took off. On the other hand, the one at Rocca San Silvestro, known as the Parco Archeominerario di San Silvestro was a huge success. These experiences became the cornerstone of Francovich's career, turning his attention toward landscape architecture. He became a great supporter of local participation in site management.\nFrancovich's career as an archaeologist, with specialization in Medieval Archaeology in Italy, spanned nearly three decades. It was his research and excavations in Tuscany that led to it becoming the best-studied region of its kind in Europe.He died in a fall from a height in the forest of Montececeri, near Fiesole."

The Count became one of Sigismund's most powerful advisers,  and it was easy for him to obtain the bishopric of Freising for his son Hermann when it suddenly fell vacant.\nAt this time Hermann was studying in Bologna, when on 26 July 1412 Pope John XXII, on the intervention of the German emperor Sigismund, named him Bishop of Freising. As he was still too young to be consecrated a bishop, he received a papal dispensation allowing him to rule in Freising. He had to borrow 10,000 Gulden from his father to pay the annates due to the papacy. On 8 September 1413 he was anointed bishop.\nThe cathedral chapter of Freising was entirely taken by surprise by the sudden death of Bishop Konrad von Hebenstreit and the equally sudden nomination of Hermann, which prevented it from exercising its right of election.\nFrom 1414 to 1418 Hermann took part in the Council of Constance, where he represented the interests of king Sigismund. In the summer of 1419 he agreed an alliance with the bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Salzburg, under the leadership of the Archbishop, for the protection of their spiritual Immunit\u00e4tsrechte with the promise of mutual support against the territorial princes.\nBecause of their good relations with the king the family was able to persuade Pope Martin V to transfer him to the seat of the Prince-Bishop of Trent, vacant since the banishment of George of Lichtenstein in August 1419. The Papal nomination took place on 29 March 1421, but Martin V was oblige to rescind it on 13 September 1421, as the cathedral chapter of Trent were not willing to accept Hermann, because of his severe hernia. In order to regain Trent he returned to Cilli in late autumn and underwent an operation, which he did not survive.\nHe died on 13 December 1421 and was buried in the parish church of Celje, now Celje Cathedral. His monument is in the presbytery, on the Gospel side.\n\n\n== Notes and references =="

But in a very radical stance for the day, Thurber championed the rights of women, people of color and the handicapped to attend her school, sometimes on full scholarship. This was 1885\u2014two decades since the end of the American Civil War\u2014and her school was racially integrated, promoted women, and had an inclusive stance toward the handicapped.\nThurber founded the school in part because of her belief that a nation should cultivate its own unique music\u2014an unusual stance when the prevailing attitude was that all cultured art, especially orchestral music, came from Germany or Italy. While running the school, she sponsored competitions for American musicians to develop American music.\n\nThe National Conservatory of Music of America was the outstanding institution for professional musical preparation in the United States for some 25 years or more. At its height in the 1890s it boasted a faculty of international renown ... and initiated a course of studies whose features became a basis for the curriculum now taken for granted in the colleges and conservatories of this country. Its achievements resulted from the endeavors of a single visionary: Jeannette M Thurber, a wealthy, idealistic New Yorker who devoted most of her life to the school ... Although her innovative design for the Conservatory was influential in shaping the course of American music for the 20th century, Mrs. Thurber and her school have slipped into undeserved obscurity.\""

He studied English in college but left before completion, and worked on various newspapers and magazines in Yogyakarta. According to Harry Aveling, Suryadi's prose-lyric Pengakuan Pariyem (Pariyem's Confession) attracted considerable attention for its bold use of Javanese words and phrases. In Pengakuan Pariyem, Suryadi describes the life of a female servant of a noble family which is limited by the traditions of the court town of Yogyakarta. Even though this prose poem was hailed as a penetrating analysis of culture that reveals Javanese social life, Niels Mulder suggests that it is basically an idealization of a system of values that belongs to the past.In 1982, Linus Suryadi AG studied at the International Writing Program in Iowa in the U.S. He was a member of the Yogyakarta Arts Council and was the editor of Citra Yogya, a journal of art and culture.Linus Suryadi AG was also the editor of Tonggak: Antologi Puisi Indonesia Modern (The Beginning: Anthology of Modern Indonesian Poetry), a four volume set of Indonesian poetry that spans 60 years, from the 1920s to the 1980s According to E.

At the Pereiaslav Council of 1660 that concluded the Treaty of Slobodyshche he was elected colonel of Pereiaslav regiment and Acting Hetman of Left-Bank Ukraine. But he strongly opposed the treaty because it restored the union with Poland, and annulled the Pereiaslav articles, which he favored more of a pro-Russian orientation. Which caused a civil war between Right-bank Cossacks who favored a pro-Polish policies, and Left-bank Cossacks who favored pro-Russian policies. In 1661 he led a revolt against Yurii Khmelnytsky with left-bank regiments, and Zaporozhian otaman Ivan Briukhovetsky.\nDuring the Russo-Polish War he fought against the Poles, and the Crimean Tatars, in order to re-unite all of the Cossack lands under his reign. At first he was a strong supporter of Tsardom of Russia, but initially withdrew his support because of disagreements, and lack of help on restoring Ukraine. But Russia started seeking aid with Somko's opponents, in particular with Ivan Briukhovetsky who supported Russian rule, they in turn started accusing Somko of secret negotiations with Khmelnytsky, and Pavlo Teteria, which caused to delay the final decision of the Cossack starshyna council at Kozelets in 1662 to recognize his tenure as hetman.\nIn order to decide on a new hetman, a Chorna rada took place on June 17\u201318, 1663 near Nizhyn, where a cossack council consisting of the starshyna, and a large number of common cossacks elected a new hetman for left-bank Ukraine. The officers proposed him and colonel Vasyl Zolotarenko of the Nizhyn Regiment as candidates, but the majority and including the Tsar supported  Briukhovetsky and elected him the new hetman. Both Somko, and Zolotarenko were imprisoned and then were handed over to Briukhovetsky, who had them executed in Borzna on September 28, 1664."

He succeeded the pioneering work of Henri-Gustave Delvigne and Louis-\u00c9tienne de Thouvenin.\nMini\u00e9 served in a number of African campaigns with the Chasseurs, after which he was eventually promoted to captain.  In 1846 he designed the Mini\u00e9 ball, a cylindrical bullet with a conical hollow in the base which expanded when fired.  This projectile, combined with his rifle, resulted in a major improvement in firearm accuracy.\nThe French government rewarded Mini\u00e9 with some 20,000 francs and installed him as a member of the staff at the Vincennes military school. In 1858 he retired from the Imperial Russian Army with the rank of colonel and later served as a military instructor for the khedive of Egypt and as a manager at the Remington Arms Company in the United States. His rifling technology proved critical to the increase in firearms accuracy seen during the American Civil War."

He rivals Antonio Stradivari (1644\u20131737) with regard to the respect and reverence accorded his instruments, and for many prominent players and collectors his instruments are the most coveted of all. Instruments made by Guarneri are often referred to as Del Ges\u00f9s.\nGuarneri is known as del Ges\u00f9 (literally \"of Jesus\") because his labels after 1731 incorporated the nomen sacrum, IHS (iota-eta-sigma) and a cross fleury. His instruments diverged significantly from family tradition, becoming uniquely his own style. They are considered equal in quality to those of Stradivari, and claimed by some to be superior. Guarneri's violins often have a darker, more robust, and more sonorous tone than Stradivari's. Fewer than 200 of Guarneri's instruments survive. They are all violins, although one cello bearing his father's label, dated 1731, seems to have been completed by del Ges\u00f9. The quality and scarcity of his instruments have resulted in sale prices in excess of $10 million USD.\nAn asteroid has been named 19185 Guarneri in his honour."

A Democrat, Waller served as the 56th governor of Mississippi from 1972 to 1976. Born near Oxford, Mississippi to a farming family, Waller went to law school and in 1950 established a law practice in Jackson. Nine years later, he was elected District Attorney of Hinds County, Mississippi. Waller attempted to reform the position and provoked the ire of local law enforcement for aggressively prosecuting several cases. In 1964, he twice prosecuted Byron De La Beckwith for the murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers, with both trials resulting in deadlocked juries. In 1967, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for governor, finishing fifth in the Democratic primary.\nWaller ran for governor again in 1971, denouncing state establishment leaders and winning in the primary and in the general election. Taking office in January 1972, he associated himself with the New South governors, his moderate contemporaries in other Southern states. Though unsuccessful in reconciling racial differences within the Mississippi Democratic Party, he brought blacks into state government and successfully shut down the State Sovereignty Commission. His tenure was also marked by his significant disagreement with the Mississippi State Legislature. After leaving gubernatorial office in 1976, Waller returned to practicing law in Jackson. He ran for a U.S. Senate seat in 1978 and for governor again in 1987, losing both races. He released his memoirs in 2007 and died four years later."

He was a deputy in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies for Durango and a member of the Supreme Executive Power following the downfall of the First Mexican Empire, which was followed by the 1824 Constitution and his presidency. He later served as Governor of Puebla.\nBorn in Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain (now Durango), he graduated from the College of San Ildefonso with a Bachelor of Laws degree. He joined the Mexican War of Independence under general Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos. During the war, he became one of the most prominent independence generals, participating in numerous battles, including the siege of Cuautla, the capture of Oaxaca, and many battles in Veracruz. In 1817, his troops deserted him, and he stayed in hiding until 1821, when the independence movement was reinvigorated by generals Vicente Guerrero and Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, and he helped re-capture Veracruz.\nVictoria remained an important and popular figure in the army during the First Mexican Empire, after the Declaration of Independence, wherein de Iturbide served as Emperor Agust\u00edn. The two were at odds due to de Iturbide's suspension of congress and his refusal to install a republican form of government. Victoria joined Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna's revolt, and de Iturbide was exiled in 1823. Victoria then served as part of the Provisional Government from 1823 to 1824, when congress ratified the Constitution of 1824, and elected Victoria as Mexico's first president.\nAs president he established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, the United States, the Federal Republic of Central America, and Gran Colombia. He also founded the National Museum, promoted education, and ratified the border with the United States of America. He decreed the expulsion of the Spaniards remaining in the country and defeated the last Spanish stronghold in the castle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa.\nIn 1829, Victoria peacefully passed the presidency to general Vicente Guerrero. Victoria was the only president to complete his full term in more than 30 years of an independent Mexico. He later served as a senator for Durango and Veracruz, governor of Puebla, and president of the senate. He negotiated an end to the Pastry War with France in 1838. He died in 1843 at the age of 56 from epilepsy in the fortress of Perote, where he was receiving medical treatment. On 8 April of the same year, it was decreed that his name would be written in golden letters in the session hall of the Chamber of Deputies.Victoria is considered a national hero and one of the most popular presidents in the history of early Mexico. There are numerous streets, airports, schools, and cities  (most notably Victoria de Durango and Ciudad Victoria) named in his honor."

He studied at the University of Louvain and when twenty-two years of age was a lawyer, but before long he turned his attention exclusively to history and became a priest. The Prince-Abbot of Fulda commissioned Schannat to write the history of the abbey and appointed him historiographer and librarian. At a later date he received similar commissions from Franz Georg von Sch\u00f6nborn, Archbishop of Trier and Bishop of Worms. In 1735 the Archbishop of Prague, Count Moriz von Manderscheid, sent Schannat to Italy to collect material for a history of the councils. He made researches with especial success in the Ambrosian Library in Milan and the Vatican Library at Rome. He died in Heidelberg."

        "content": "Charles-Victor Pr\u00e9vot, vicomte d'Arlincourt (26 September 1788 \u2014 22 January 1856) was a French novelist, born at the Ch\u00e2teau de M\u00e9rantais, Magny-les-Hameaux, Yvelines.\nIn the 1820s, the popularity of this author, upon whom was bestowed the epithet \"the prince of the romantics\", rivalled that of Victor Hugo.\nHis father Louis-Adrien Pr\u00e9vost d'Arlincourt was guillotined on 8 May 1794, along with Antoine Lavoisier and 26 other farmers-general. At the beginning of the First Empire, his mother pleaded his cause before Napoleon, who decided to name him \u00e9cuyer (\"squire\") to Madame M\u00e8re. At the age of 29, he married the daughter of a senator, and composed a tragedy, Charlemagne, which was declined by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais. In 1811 Napoleon appointed him as a master (auditeur) at the Council of State, then as an intendant in the Spanish army. He participated in the Spanish campaign and was present at the capture of Tarragona.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, he succeeded in ingratiating himself with Louis XVIII, who named him Master of Requests. He bought a chateau and adopted the title of viscount. In 1818, he orchestrated a huge publicity campaign for the publication of his epic poem, Charlemagne, ou la Carol\u00e9ide, and presented himself before the Academy, where his candidature obtained exactly one vote. Undiscouraged, he began work on a novel which he believed would bring him as great a reputation as Chateaubriand's.\nLe Solitaire appeared in 1821 and achieved an \"extraordinary, even colossal, celebrity.\" In the space of several months, the book was reprinted a dozen times; it was translated into ten languages; there were no fewer than seven operas based on its story, and twice as many dramatic adaptations; and it was the subject of innumerable songs, parodies, paintings and lithographs. The success of his next three novels, Le Ren\u00e9gat in 1822, Ipsibo\u00e9 in 1823, and L'\u00c9trang\u00e8re in 1825, was almost as great.\nAdulated above all by his female readership, who saw him as \"the new Ossian\", he was harpooned by critics. His plot points were judged impossible, his characters cardboard, and his imagery grotesque. His taste for syntactic inversions, with which he generously adorned his prose, led to the nickname \"the inversive Viscount\", and the result was memorably parodied in Illusions perdues by Balzac (who, nevertheless, was strongly influenced in his first works by the gothic style of d'Arlincourt). The Academic Charles-Marie de F\u00e9letz wrote that \"Le Solitaire has so far been translated into every single known language, except of course French.\" Later assessments were no more favourable. His novels, now classified as \"gothic\", were then labelled fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique: \"containing a mysterious intrigue centred on some illustrious and guilty wretch who traipses through a thousand violent incidents towards a bloody catastrophe.\"\nD'Arlincourt's vanity and egocentricity were the subject of many anecdotes, including a story of his attempts to persuade his portrait-painter, Robert Lef\u00e8vre, to make his eyes look larger and larger, until they were \"like those of an ox\"; the result was still considered unsatisfactory by his wife, who confronted the painter, turning to her husband and telling him to \"Do that thing with your eyes.\" (Mon ami, fais tes yeux.) He also posed for Jean-Baptiste Isabey.\nD'Arlincourt frequently defended himself in print, explaining that it was his goal to \"spiritualize all the impressions of existence\"; he presented a play he wrote in his youth, Le Si\u00e8ge de Paris, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais in 1826, but it was promptly torn to pieces by the critics. Not always justly: some of the most ridiculed extracts are not in fact by him.\nHe made two long journeys through Europe, in 1841 and 1844, visiting exiled princes, and on his return presented a new play, La Peste noire, which was received no more favourably than the first. In 1848, outraged by the events of June, he published Dieu le veut! (\"God wills it!\"), a pamphlet which led to legal troubles for the author but also increased his popularity. In 1850 he published L'Italie rouge, a hostile account of the Risorgimento. In the last years of his life, still \"avid for acclaim\", he was a frequent guest of salons."

Aubert first came to New Zealand in 1860 and formed the Congregation of the Holy Family to educate M\u0101ori children. She founded a religious order, the Daughters of Our Lady of Compassion in 1892. Aubert later started two hospitals in Wellington; the first, St Joseph's Home for the Incurables in 1900, and Our Lady's Home of Compassion in 1907.\nAubert devoted her life to helping others. Her work took her from France to Auckland then to Hawke\u2019s Bay, to the Whanganui River and finally to Wellington. And along the way, she founded a new Catholic congregation, cared for children and the sick, by skilfully combining M\u0101ori medicine and P\u0101keh\u0101 science, and wrote books in M\u0101ori, English and French adding significantly to a higher cultural understanding and literary heritage.\nAubert was actively engaged with the local M\u0101ori population and spoke M\u0101ori well.

The Albert-Fraenkel-Plakette (Albert Fraenkel award) is given to German-speaking cardiologists who have excelled in the field.\n\nBorn in 1864 in Mu\u00dfbach an der Weinstra\u00dfe, Albert was the son of a Jewish merchant. He studied medicine in Munich and Strasbourg (then the German city of Stra\u00dfburg) in the 1880s. He initially practiced internal medicine and obstetrics, but turned to studying diseases of the lungs after suffering from tuberculosis. He established a tuberculosis sanatorium at Badenweiler in the Black Forest. Fraenkel also first used g-Strophanthin (ouabain) in heart failure, a practice which continues to be advocated by some practitioners in Germany.\nFraenkel's later life was marred by Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany. He was stripped of his position as professor at Heidelberg in 1933 and his license to practice medicine was revoked in 1938, three months before his death."

        "content": "Siegfried (or Sigfrid) II of Westerburg (before 1260 \u2013 7 April 1297, in Bonn) was Archbishop of Cologne from 1275 to 1297.\nSiegfried was the second son of Siegfried IV, Count of Runkel in Westerburg (died 1266). His older brother was Henry (Heinrich) I of Westerburg (who would be killed at the Battle of Worringen in 1288).Siegfried was consecrated Archbishop of Cologne in March 1275 in Lyon. The city of Cologne since 1268 had been under excommunication, and was therefore deemed an unsuitable place for consecration. In July 1275, as the new Archbishop of Cologne, Siegfried lifted the city\u2019s excommunication and signed a friendship treaty with the city.  In October 1279 in Pingsheim (now part of N\u00f6rvenich), he concluded the Peace of Pingsheim with the Counts of J\u00fclich. On 27 April 1285 he awarded Br\u00fchl, situated south of Cologne, town and market rights.\nAround 1283, Siegfried took the side of Count Reinoud I of Guelders in the War of the Limburg Succession. In March 1287, he led the opposition the taxation of the clergy proposed by the cardinal legate Giovanni Boccamazza at the Synod of W\u00fcrzburg. In July 1287, he freed the city of Cologne, after receiving a loyalty oath from its citizens, from paying duties to finance his war expenses in the Limburg succession conflict.\nHis involvement in the Limburg succession dispute led to the Battle of Worringen on 5 June 1288. Siegfried lost the battle, which also involved citizens from Cologne led by Gerhard Overstolzen and from Berg under the leadership of Walter Dodds. Siegfried was taken prisoner by Duke John I of Brabant and delivered over to Count Adolf VIII of Berg. After first spending a night confined in the Schelmenturm at Monheim, he was subsequently brought to Schloss Burg.\nSiegfried was released on 6 July 1289 but had fallen ill during the time of his difficult captivity. He earlier had to conclude peace treaties with the victors of Worringen on 19 May 1289. He had to pay reparations of 12,000 marks (about three tons of silver) to the Count of Berg, cede areas (among others, L\u00fcnen with all episcopal rights, Westhofen, Brackel, Werl, Menden, Isenberg, and Raffenberg) and the (sub-) Vogtship over the Diocese of Essen to Eberhard II, Count of the Mark (who thereby benefited most from the victory at Worringen), pledge the town of Deutz and some castles, and tear down other castles like Worringen, Zons, and Volmarstein. The Duchy of Limburg was occupied Duke John I of Brabant.\nAs a consequence of his defeat, on 18 June 1288 he had to recognize in a contract 'the sovereignty of the city' of Cologne. However on 18 January 1290, Pope Nicholas IV relieved him of all the promises which he had given to Cologne. On 31 January the Pope even called for the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier to help Siegfried recover the Cologne Archbishopric\u2019s possessions.\nAfter his release, the Elector preferred to make his residence in Bonn. The archbishop's mint in Cologne ceased operations and Siegfried made Bonn his new mint city. As a challenge to Cologne, he chose the name \u201cVerona\u201d for Bonn, and issued his coins with the inscription \"Beata Verona Vince\u201d (\u201cYou, Happy Verona will win\"). In 1286 Siegfrid introduced the first town constitution in Bonn. It specified that the distinguished citizens (oppidani maiores) should choose twelve suitable men, the best the city had to offer, whose decisions would be binding for the whole citizenry.\nIn the upcoming election of the King of Germany in 1292, Siegfried favored Count Adolf of Nassau, his brother-in-law, to enable the Archbishop to recover from his vast concessions. In the Treaty of Andernach on 27 April 1292, Adolf of Nassau agreed to all of Siegfried\u2019s demands, including the transfer to the Archbishopric of imperial cities like Dortmund and Duisburg, imperial castles and estates, and the Vogtship of Essen. On 5 May 1292, Siegfried saw to the successful election of Adolf of Nassau, and crowned him on 24 June 1292 in Aachen.\nSiegfrieds restoration policy, however, was doomed to fail, because of the opposition of the \"Coalition of Worringen.\" He could neither restore the link between his Rhenish and Westphalian possessions, nor re-integrate the city of Cologne into the Diocese. Because of the non-fulfillment of the requirements of the Treaty of Andernach, the kingdom of Adolf of Nassau then collapsed as well.\nSiegfried died on 7 April 1297 in Bonn and was buried in the Bonn Minster.\n\n\n== References =="

He rose to power as Regent Plenipotentiary of Ethiopia (Enderase) for Empress Zewditu from 1916 until 1930. Haile Selassie is widely considered a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history, and the major figure of Rastafari, a religious movement in Jamaica that emerged shortly after he became emperor in the 1930s. Before he rose to power he defeated Ras Gugsa Welle Bitul (nephew of Empress Taytu) of Begemder at the Battle of Anchem in 1928. He was a member of the Solomonic dynasty, which claims to trace lineage to Emperor Menelik I, a legendary figure believed by the claimants to be the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who they name as Makeda.\nHaile Selassie attempted to modernise the country through a series of political and social reforms, including the introduction of the 1931 constitution, its first written constitution, and the abolition of slavery. He led the failed efforts to defend Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and spent most of the period of Italian occupation exiled in the United Kingdom. In 1940, he travelled to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to assist in coordinating the anti-fascist struggle in Ethiopia and returned to his home country in 1941 after the East African campaign. He dissolved the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, which was established by the UN General Assembly in 1950, and annexed Eritrea into Ethiopia as one of its provinces, while fighting to prevent secession.Haile Selassie's internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations. In 1963, he presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity, the precursor of the African Union, and served as its first chairman. In 1974, he was overthrown in a military coup by a Marxist\u2013Leninist junta, the Derg. On 27 August 1975, Haile Selassie was assassinated by Derg military officers, a fact that was only revealed in 1994.Among some members of the Rastafari movement, Haile Selassie is referred to as the returned messiah of the Bible, God incarnate. This distinction notwithstanding, he was a Christian and adhered to the tenets and liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. He has been criticised by some historians for his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy (the mesafint), which consistently opposed his changes. Some critics have also criticised Ethiopia's failure to modernise rapidly enough. During his rule the Harari people were persecuted and many left the Harari Region. His administration was also criticised by human rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch, as autocratic and illiberal. Although some sources state that late during his administration the Oromo language was banned from education, public speaking and use in administration, there was never an official law or government policy that criminalised any language. The Haile Selassie government relocated numerous Amharas into southern Ethiopia where they served in government administration, courts, and church. Following the death of Hachalu Hundessa in June 2020, the Statue of Haile Selassie in Cannizaro Park, London was destroyed by Oromo protesters, and his father's equestrian monument in Harar was removed."

He was appointed as Peshwa in 1740 upon the death of his father, the Peshwa Bajirao I.\nDuring his tenure, the Chhatrapati (Maratha Emperor) was a mere figurehead. At the same time, the Maratha empire started transforming into a confederacy, in which individual chiefs\u2014such as the Holkars, the Scindias and the Bhonsles of Nagpur kingdom\u2014became more powerful. During Balaji Rao's tenure, the Maratha territory reached its zenith. A large part of this expansion, however, was led by the individual chiefs of the Maratha Empire.\nBalaji Bajirao was an astute strategist, a shrewd diplomat and an accomplished statesman. He, along with his cousin Sadashivrao Bhau, introduced new legislative and financial systems in the state. Under his leadership, the borders of the Maratha Empire expanded to Peshawar in present-day Pakistan, Srirangapatna in the South, and Medinipur in present-day West Bengal. Nanasaheb built canals, bridges, temples and lodges for travellers in the capital city of Pune and in other parts of the Maratha Empire. In his twenty-year reign as the Peshwa, Nanasaheb subdued three major powers under his tenure, viz. Mughals in the North, the Nizam in the South and the Bengal Sultanate. Along with that he also weakened the Afghan control over Punjab, stopped their repeated invasions on the imperial capital of Delhi, subdued the Rajputs and Rohillas and neutralized the state of Oudh. He greatly improved the condition of peasants and brought remarkable changes in the state of agriculture. Many successful economic changes took place during his tenure."

A member of the House of Oldenburg, he was the son of Christian VI of Denmark and Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.\nAlthough the personal influence of Frederick was limited, his reign was marked by the progress of commerce and trade, and art and science prospered under his reign. Unlike his parents who were deeply devoted to Pietism, Frederick grew into a hedonist. As regent, he took part in the conduct of government by attending council meetings, but he was afflicted by alcoholism and most of his rule was dominated by able ministers who were influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. His ministers marked his reign by the progress of commerce and the emerging industry. They also avoided involving Denmark-Norway in the European wars of his time. Although Frederick V wasn't personally interested in cultural affairs, his first wife was, and the public entertainment and freedom of expression that had been banned during his father's reign was again permitted."

Grabar, descendant of a wealthy Rusyn family, was trained as a painter by Ilya Repin in Saint Petersburg and by Anton A\u017ebe in Munich. He reached his peak in painting in 1903\u20131907 and was notable for a peculiar divisionist painting technique bordering on pointillism and his rendition of snow.\nBy the end of 1890s, Grabar had established himself as an art critic. In 1902, he joined Mir Iskusstva, although his relations with its leaders Sergei Diaghilev and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky were far from friendly. In 1910\u20131915, Grabar edited and published his opus magnum, the History of Russian Art. The History employed the finest artists and critics of the period; Grabar personally wrote the issues on architecture that set an unsurpassed standard of understanding and presenting the subject. Concurrently, he wrote and published a series of books on contemporary and historic Russian painters. In 1913, he was appointed executive director of the Tretyakov Gallery and launched an ambitious reform program that continued until 1926. Grabar diversified the Tretyakov collection into modern art and in 1917 published its first comprehensive catalogue. In 1921 Grabar became the first professor of Art restoration at the Moscow State University.\nAn experienced politician, Grabar stayed at the top of the Soviet art establishment until his death, excluding a brief voluntary retirement in 1933\u20131937. He managed art-restoration workshops (present-day Grabar Centre) during 1918\u20131930 and from 1944 to 1960. Grabar took active part in redistribution of former church art nationalized by the Bolsheviks and established new museums for the confiscated treasures. In 1943, he formulated the Soviet doctrine of compensating World War II losses with art looted in Germany. After the war, he personally advised Joseph Stalin on the preservation of architectural heritage."

Between the ages of 8 and 9, he showed precocious talent in the fields of music, poetry and painting. In 1913 he met the Futurists.\nHis attraction to the latest innovations was expressed in almost completely Futurist forms in his drawings, while he developed a unique style in his painting that was a mixture of Art Nouveau, Fauvism, Expressionism and Orphism. It was not until 1917, after meeting with Giacomo Balla in Rome, and with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in Naples (who later enthusiastically praised Conti's book Imbottigliature which was about to be printed) that Conti became part of the Futurist movement. His contribution to the movement was not only his literary works but also the paintings and drawings he produced between 1917 and 1919\u2014the years in which his work was taking on the metaphysical style.\nThe 1920s were a complex period for Conti. He explored Mannerism, Exoticism, Pittura Metafisica, and great historical and religious painting, covering a vast area that can be compared with his keen interest in the theatrical and literary world of Luigi Pirandello, Massimo Bontempelli and Enrico Pea, which led him to found the Viareggio Prize in 1929.\nThe 1930s brought a series of alternating events that created problems in his private life and led to his celebrative paintings. The decade also saw his enforced adhesion to Fascism (joining the Partito Nazionale Fascista), and his inner rebellion against it which transpired from his refusal to join Margherita Sarfatti's Novecento Italiano group and from other episodes when he stepped out of line. New prospects were only opened up to him when he became involved in designing stage sets for the opera house with the foundation of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino.\nBy the 1940s, long before the official rediscovery (20 years later) of the Futurist movement, Conti was again working on Futurist subjects and experiments. From 1948 to 1963 he followed the rules of the Order of the Franciscans, though he still continued to paint.\nMany of his works are housed in the Museo Primo Conti (Primo Conti Foundation Museum [1]) in the Villa le Coste at Fiesole (near Florence)."

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of the Third Reich.These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 [The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945]. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had been nominated for the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Listed here are the 603 recipients whose last name is in the range \"Schu\u2013Sz\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of 14 of these listings. This is the second of two lists of all 1,060 Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients whose last names start with \"S\". The remaining recipients whose last name starts with \"Sa\u2013Schr\" are listed at List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Sa\u2013Schr).

Unhappy with Teresa's romantic relationship with Galician Fernando P\u00e9rez de Traba and his political influence, the Portuguese nobility rallied around Afonso, who revolted and defeated his mother at the Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede in 1128 and became Count of Portugal soon afterwards.

Huet\u2019s interest in printmaking and his acquaintance with Gilles Demarteau, who later engraved many of his compositions, both date from this period. About 1764 Huet entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Le Prince, where he further developed his printmaking skills, largely reproducing his own paintings, a method of publishing them with some profit.\nIn 1768 he was approved (agr\u00e9\u00e9) by the Acad\u00e9mie Royale, and 29 July 1769 he was received (re\u00e7u) in the minor category (petite mani\u00e8re) of painter of animals and was well received in the public reviews when he began to exhibit at the Paris Salon that same year, with a Dog Attacking Geese, now at the Louvre. He continued to exhibit annually until 1789, though his attempts at the grand manner of history painting, considered the noblest genre, were not met with approval.\nThe most important of his paintings were his morceau de r\u00e9ception, the Fox among the Chickens  (San Francisco,  California Palace of the Legion of Honor), The Dairymaid  (Paris, Mus\u00e9e Cognacq-Jay).\nHuet is equally known for his designs for the decorative arts.  He provided scenic vignettes to be printed by copperplate on cottons at the manufacture of toiles de Jouy directed by Oberkampf. Lengths of these may be seen at The Detroit Institute of Arts, the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and many other institutions. His ink-and-wash drawings and studies of animals and children are also admired.\nIn the 1780s he provided tapestry cartoons for the manufacture at Beauvais. A suite of thirteen hangings of pastorals was in the Isaac de Camondo bequest to the Louvre. In 1790 he remained attached to the reorganized and combined tapestry manufacture of Gobelins and Beauvais."

Gegenbaur noted that the most reliable clue to evolutionary history is homology, the comparison of anatomical parts which have a common evolutionary origin.Gegenbaur had been a student of Albert von K\u00f6lliker, Rudolf Virchow, Heinrich M\u00fcller and Franz Leydig (1821\u20131908)."

Later he attacked a gun position accompanied by two men, both of whom were immediately shot down. He went on alone to the gun, killing the team and capturing the gun. On a third occasion when the advance was again held up this officer collected a small party and rushed the position, inflicting heavy losses on the garrison.

        "content": "Edgar Buckingham (July 8, 1867 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \u2013 April 29, 1940 in Washington DC) was an American physicist.\nHe graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1887. He did graduate work at Strasbourg and then studied under the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig, from which he was granted a PhD in 1893.  He worked at the USDA Bureau of Soils from 1902 to 1906 as a soil physicist. He worked at the (US) National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST) 1906\u20131937. His fields of expertise included soil physics, gas properties, acoustics, fluid mechanics, and blackbody radiation.  He is also the originator of the Buckingham \u03c0 theorem in the field of dimensional analysis.In 1923, Buckingham published a report which voiced skepticism that jet propulsion would be economically competitive with prop driven aircraft at low altitudes and at the speeds of that period.Buckingham's first work on soil physics is on soil aeration, particularly the loss of carbon dioxide from the soil and its subsequent replacement by oxygen. From his experiments he found that the rate of gas diffusion in soil was not dependent significantly on the soil structure, compactness or water content of the soil. Using an empirical formula based on his data, Buckingham was able to give the diffusion coefficient as a function of air content. This relation is still commonly cited in many modern textbooks and used in modern research. The outcomes of his research on gas transport were to conclude that the exchange of gases in soil aeration takes place by diffusion and is sensibly independent of the variations of the outside barometric pressure.\nBuckingham then worked on soil water, research for which he is now renowned. Buckingham's work on soil water is published in Bulletin 38 USDA Bureau of Soils: Studies on the movement of soil moisture, which was released in 1907. This document contained three sections, the first of which looked at evaporation of water from below a layer of soil. He found that soils of various textures could strongly inhibit evaporation, particularly where capillary flow through the uppermost layers was prevented. The second section of Bulletin 38 looked at the drying of soils under arid and humid conditions. Buckingham found evaporative losses were initially higher from the arid soil, then after three days the evaporation under arid conditions became less than under humid conditions, with the total loss ending up greater from the humid soil. Buckingham believed this occurred due to the self-mulching behaviour (he referred to it as the soil forming a natural mulch) exhibited by the soil under arid conditions.\nThe third section of Bulletin 38 contains the work on unsaturated flow and capillary action for which Buckingham is famous. He firstly recognized the importance of the potential of the forces arising from interactions between soil and water. He called this the capillary potential, this is now known as the moisture or water potential (matric potential). He combined capillary theory and an energy potential in soil physics theory, and was the first to expound the dependence of soil hydraulic conductivity on capillary potential. This dependence later came to be known as relative permeability in petroleum engineering. He also applied a formula equivalent to Darcy's law to unsaturated flow."

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of the Third Reich.These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 [The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945]. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had been nominated for the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Listed here are the 457 recipients whose last name is in the range \"Sa\u2013Schr\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of 11 of these listings. This is the first of two lists of all 1,060 Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients whose last names start with \"S\". The recipients whose last name is in the range \"Schu\u2013Sz\" are listed at List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Schu\u2013Sz).

He was the son of pathologist Alexander Kolisko (1857-1918).\nEugen Kolisko is remembered for his pioneer work in anthroposophy. He was introduced to anthroposophy through his classmate, Walter Johannes Stein (1891-1957). In 1914, he first attended lectures given by Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Consequently, he became a member of the Anthroposophical Society, and in 1920 was invited as an instructor to the newly established Waldorf School at Stuttgart by Emil Molt (1876-1936).\nKolisko specialized in preventative medicine, and at the Waldorf School he worked with other teachers in creating a curriculum that focused on the spiritual and physical development of school children. He was instrumental in construction of several artistic therapies, such as anthroposophic music therapy and eurythmy. During the 1930s, he left the Waldorf School in Stuttgart for political reasons, relocating to England in 1936, where he undertook the establishment of a private educational institute. Kolisko died of cardiac failure outside London on 29 November 1939.\nHis wife, Lili Kolisko (1893-1976), introduced a concept known as Steigbildmethode (capillary dynamolysis method), which dealt with Bildschaffenden methods for assessment of food quality from an anthroposophic standpoint. Today, the \"Kolisko Conferences\" are a series of international conferences of teachers, physicians, therapists and parents who meet in order to further the concepts and philosophy of a Waldorf education. \nEugen Kolisko was the author of numerous written works, published both in German and English; the following are a few of his better known English publications:\n\n\"The Human Organism in the Light of Anthroposophy\"\n\"Lead and the Human Organism\"\n\"Nutrition and Agriculture\"\n\"The Threefold Human Organism: A Series of Lectures\"\n\"Three Fundamental Problems of the Anthroposophical Knowledge of Man I. the Bodily Foundation of Thinking\"\n\"Reincarnation and Other Essays\"\n\"The Classification of the Animal Kingdom Articles in the Present Age', Vol. 1, Nos. 2 & 3\"\n\"Zoology for everybody : a series of lectures\"\n\"Nutrition: a Series of Lectures: 1 - the Transformation of Matter\""

He later retired from the army as a kapten. Together with Claes Egnell, Willie Grut and Gustaf Lindh he competed in the 1948 Winter Olympics in the winter pentathlon, which was contested as a demonstration event. As an excellent skier, he won both the downhill and the 10 km cross country disciplines, but lagged behind in shooting, fencing and horse riding. He finished third overall and won the bronze medal. Fellow countrymen Lindh and Grut took the first and second place respectively.Since the winter pentathlon would have no other appearances at the Olympic Games, Haase turned to the modern pentathlon. He was selected for the 1956 Summer Olympics and finished 17th individually. In the team contest Sweden was the favourite as it included Bj\u00f6rn Thofelt and the individual Olympic champion Lars Hall. In the first event, horse riding, Thofelt had drawn the lot for a very peculiar horse and eventually suffered from a concussion, after he fell off twice and had to withdraw. Consequently, the Swedish team was not ranked.Hasse was also successful at the world championships. He won the team title in 1950, with Lars Hall and Thor Henning, and placed third in 1954, with \u00c5ke Julin and Thofelt. Haase's home club was Studenternas Idrottsf\u00f6rening Stockholm. He completed an engineering study at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm with a focus on metallurgical and then worked in the metallurgical industry in Fagersta, where he resided until his death in July 2014.\n\n\n== References =="

Born in Dublin, Burke served as a member of Parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons of Great Britain with the Whig Party.\nBurke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state. These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society (1756). He criticised the actions of the British government towards the American colonies, including its taxation policies. Burke also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, although he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. He is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation, the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company, and his staunch opposition to the French Revolution.\nIn his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of \"good\" society and traditional institutions of state and society, and he condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party which he dubbed the Old Whigs as opposed to the pro\u2013French Revolution New Whigs led by Charles James Fox.In the 19th century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals. Subsequently, in the 20th century, he became widely regarded, especially in the United States, as the philosophical founder of conservatism."

Long known for his leadership ability, he became the Monarchs' manager in 1941 when Andy Cooper suffered a pre-season stroke and died during the season.  He won the Negro American League championship that season, but resigned as manager just before the beginning of the following season, resuming his duties as a reserve infielder.\nAllen's accomplishments as a player were even more impressive. A master at scoring runs, he bunted, stole bases and almost always provided the spark his team needed to win. Among the fastest baserunners of his generation of Negro leaguers, his most remarkable season was his 1929 campaign, in which he batted .330 while hitting 24 doubles and stealing 23 bases in a typically abbreviated Negro league season.\nLike the comparable Judy Johnson, he was a remarkable fielder, arguably the best fielding second baseman of any race from the 1920s through the 1940s, and was at his best in pressure situations. Unlike Johnson, Newt Allen is not in the Hall of Fame, although many experts regard him as having been superior to many white inductees. Allen did make the list of 39 finalists for the 2006 special Negro leagues and Pre-Negro leagues Election, but was not one of the 17 finally chosen.\nNewt Allen is also listed on the second team of a 1952 Pittsburgh Courier Poll of the Greatest Black Players.Allen died at age 87 in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nKnown statistics: .293 career batting average, 16 home runs, 640 games."

He was the founder of both the Missionaries of Saint Charles (also known as the Scalabrinians) and the Mission Sisters of Saint Charles.Scalabrini's rise to the rank of bishop came at a rapid pace due to a series of lectures he gave on the First Vatican Council in 1872 and his staunch dedication to catechism, which led Pope Pius IX to dub him the \"Apostle of the Catechism\"; successive popes Leo XIII and Pius X held him in high esteem and both failed to convince him to accept appointments as head of an archdiocese or as a cardinal. He made five pastoral visits across his diocese which proved to be an exhaustive but effective mission of evangelization and his efforts at reforming seminaries and pastoral initiatives earned him praise even from the secular detractors who criticized him for his strict obedience to the pope.His tenure as bishop resulted in the establishment of the \"Saint Raphael Association\" dedicated to the care of Italian migrants. This solidified through the actions of his twin religious congregations and his visits to both Brazil and the United States, where he went to meet Italian immigrants. He also dealt with the Paolo Miraglia-Gulotti schism that took place in his diocese and had known the faux-bishop after ordaining him in 1879. Scalabrini also held three important episcopal gatherings in his diocese that revitalized parish and diocesan practices and made his diocese the ground for the first-ever National Catechetical Congress in 1899; he was in the process of planning another before his death that was later celebrated in 1910.Scalabrini's holiness was renowned across the Italian peninsula and there were countless who attested to his saintliness in an ensuing canonization process; his first title at the outset of the process was that of a Servant of God that Pope Pius XI bestowed upon him on 30 June 1926 while the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to title him as Venerable on 16 March 1987. John Paul II later beatified Scalabrini in Saint Peter's Square on 9 November 1997. Pope Francis canonized Scalabrini as a saint on 9 October 2022."

After practising some time at Nemours, he abandoned law, took holy orders, and was appointed tutor to one of Richelieu's nephews, the duc de Fronsac. This patronage secured for him the abbeys of Aubignac and of Mainac. The death of the duc de Fronsac in 1646 put an end to hopes of further preferment, and Ambroise Par\u00e9d'Aubignac retired to Nemours, occupying himself with literature till his death.He energetically participated in the literary controversies of his time. Against Gilles M\u00e9nage he wrote T\u00e9rence justifi\u00e9 (1656); he laid claim to having originated the idea of the Carte de tendre of Mlle de Scud\u00e9ry's Cl\u00e9li\u00e9; and after being a professed admirer of Corneille, he turned against Corneille for having neglected to mention the abb\u00e9 in his Discours sur le po\u00e8me dramatique. He was the author of four tragedies: La Cyminde (1642), La Pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans (1642), Z\u00e9nobie (1647) and Le Martyre de Sainte Catherine (1650). Z\u00e9nobie was written with the intention of affording a model in which the strict rules of the drama, as understood by the theorists, were served.In choosing subjects for his plays, d'Aubignac seems to have been guided by a desire to illustrate the various kinds of tragedy\u2014patriotic, antique and religious themes. In return, the dramatic authors whom he was in the habit of criticizing were quick to take advantage of the opportunity for retaliation offered by the production of these plays.It is as a theorist that d'Aubignac is still remembered. The credit of having been the first to play so large a part in the history of the French stage belongs to Jean Chapelain; but the laws of dramatic method and construction generally were codified by d'Aubignac in his Pratique du th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The book was only published in 1657, but he had begun writing it under Richelieu's urging as early as 1640.\nHis Conjectures acad\u00e9miques ou dissertation sur l'Iliade d'Hom\u00e8re, which was not published until nearly forty years after his death, threw doubts on the existence of Homer, and anticipated in some sense the conclusions of Friedrich August Wolf in his Prolegomena ad Homerum (1795).The contents of the Pratique du th\u00e9\u00e2tre were summarized by Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re in his notice of d'Aubignac in the Grande Encyclop\u00e9die. See also G Saintsbury, Hist. of Criticism, bk v., and Hippolyte Rigault, Histoire de la querelle des anciens et modernes (1859)."

He served as the 64th United States attorney general from January 1961 to September 1964, and as a U.S. senator from New York from January 1965 until his assassination in June 1968, when he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination. Like his brothers John F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, he was a prominent member of the Democratic Party and is an icon of modern American liberalism.Kennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. After serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1944 to 1946, Kennedy returned to his studies at Harvard University, and later received his law degree from the University of Virginia. He began his career as a correspondent for The Boston Post and as a lawyer at the Justice Department, but later resigned to manage his brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1952. The following year, he worked as an assistant counsel to the Senate committee chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He gained national attention as the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Rackets Committee from 1957 to 1959, where he publicly challenged Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa over the union's corrupt practices. Kennedy resigned from the committee to conduct his brother's successful campaign in the 1960 presidential election. He was appointed United States attorney general at the age of 35, one of the youngest cabinet members in American history. He served as his brother's closest advisor until the latter's assassination in 1963.His tenure is known for advocating for the civil rights movement, the fight against organized crime and the Mafia, and involvement in U.S. foreign policy related to Cuba. He authored his account of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a book titled Thirteen Days. As attorney general, he authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on a limited basis. After his brother's assassination, he remained in office during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, overcoming criticism that he was a \"carpetbagger\" from Massachusetts. In office, Kennedy opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and raised awareness of poverty by sponsoring legislation designed to lure private business to blighted communities (i.e., Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration project). He was an advocate for issues related to human rights and social justice by traveling abroad to eastern Europe, Latin America, and South Africa, and formed working relationships with Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, and Walter Reuther.\nIn 1968, Kennedy became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to poor, African American, Hispanic, Catholic, and young voters. His main challenger in the race was Senator Eugene McCarthy. Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. Kennedy died 25 hours later. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, like his brother's, continues to be the subject of widespread analysis and numerous conspiracy theories."

        "content": "The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its variants were the highest awards in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of the Third Reich.These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 [The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945]. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had been nominated for the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Listed here are the 118 Knight's Cross recipients of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS whose last name starts with \"A\". Fellgiebel himself delisted one and Scherzer has challenged the validity of three more of these listings. The recipients are initially ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded."

        "content": "Giovanni Papini (9 January 1881 \u2013 8 July 1956) was an Italian journalist, essayist, novelist, short story writer, poet, literary critic, and philosopher. A controversial literary figure of the early and mid-twentieth century, he was the earliest and most enthusiastic representative and promoter of Italian pragmatism. Papini was admired for his writing style and engaged in heated polemics. Involved with avant-garde movements such as futurism and post-decadentism, he moved from one political and philosophical position to another, always dissatisfied and uneasy: he converted from anti-clericalism and atheism to Catholicism, and went from convinced interventionism \u2013 before 1915 \u2013 to an aversion to war. In the 1930s, after moving from individualism to conservatism, he finally became a fascist, while maintaining an aversion to Nazism.\nAs one of the founders of the journals Leonardo (1903) and Lacerba (1913), he conceived literature as \"action\" and gave his writings an oratory and irreverent tone. Though self-educated, he was an influential iconoclastic editor and writer, with a leading role in Italian futurism and the early literary movements of youth. Working in Florence, he actively participated in foreign literary philosophical and political movements such as the French intuitionism of Bergson and the Anglo-American pragmatism of Peirce and James. Promoting the development of Italian culture and life with an individualistic and dreamy conception of life and art, he acted as a spokesman for Roman Catholic religious beliefs.\nPapini's literary success began with Il crepuscolo dei filosofi (\"The Twilight of the Philosophers\"), published in 1906, and his 1913 publication of his autobiographical novel Un uomo finito (\"A finished man\").\nDue to his ideological choices, Papini's work was almost forgotten after his death, although it was later re-evaluated and appreciated again: in 1975, the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges called him an \"undeservedly forgotten\" author."

A former member of the National Academy of Sciences, he was recognized as one of the twentieth century pioneers of polymer science. His specific interest was in theory and experiment for the structure and dynamics of polymer molecules, including various uses of the light scattering method.Stockmayer became interested in the mathematical aspects of physical chemistry as an undergraduate at MIT. A Rhodes Scholarship brought him to Jesus College, Oxford, where he undertook gas kinetics research with D. L. Chapman. He introduced the Stockmayer potential.\nStockmayer returned to MIT for Ph.D. research and pursued his study of statistical mechanics, which he later continued at Columbia University. He returned again to MIT in 1943 to study the theory of network formation and the gelation criterion. Stockmayer increasingly directed his attention to theories of polymer solutions, light scattering and chain dynamics.\nAfter a Guggenheim Fellowship for the academic year 1954/1955 in Strasbourg, France, he returned once more to MIT, then moved to Dartmouth College in 1961. There, he worked primarily on copolymers in dilute solution, established the journal Macromolecules, and collaborated with many Japanese scientists.\nStockmayer is mentioned as a friend of the author in the novel Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut, and is described as a distinguished pianist and a good skier.  A fellowship in honor of Professor Stockmayer was established at Dartmouth College in 1994."

Jarom\u00edr was resentful of the loss of tithes and fiefs and the brothers entered into a long rivalry. Jarom\u00edr even attacked the new bishop of Olomouc and carried off by force of arms the relics which had been removed from Prague to the new see. Vratislaus, for his part, spited his brother by wearing his episcopal vestments\u2014an honour conferred by the pope for the price of 100 marks per annum\u2014in his brother's presence at official functions.\nPope Alexander II sent the legate Rudolph to hold a diet in Prague in response to the conflicts surrounding the new see. Jarom\u00edr did not attend and was deposed. Gregory VII summoned the bishops to Rome. At an Easter synod in 1074, Jarom\u00edr confessed his ill-treatment of John, but refused to yield Podvin. Gregory ordered that Vratislaus should remove his brother by force if necessary.\nJarom\u00edr was an ally of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy. Jarom\u00edr was appointed chancellor by Henry and took the name Gebhard in 1077. In 1085, John died, and a Reichstag convened in Mainz to suppress the Moravian see, re-uniting it to Prague by Jarom\u00edr's insistence. Vratislaus fell out with Henry over the loss of Meissen and raised his chaplain Wecel to Olomouc as Bishop Andrew I. Jarom\u00edr went to Rome to protest to Pope Urban II.

A follower of Thelema, the new religious movement established by the English occultist Aleister Crowley, she was married to rocket pioneer and fellow Thelemite Jack Parsons.\nBorn in Belle Plaine, Iowa, Cameron volunteered for service in the United States Navy during the Second World War, after which she settled in Pasadena, California. There she met Parsons, who believed her to be the \"elemental\" woman that he had invoked in the early stages of a series of sex magic rituals called the Babalon Working. They entered into a relationship and were married in 1946. Their relationship was often strained, although Parsons sparked her involvement in Thelema and occultism. After Parsons' death in an explosion at their home in 1952, Cameron came to suspect that her husband had been assassinated and began rituals to communicate with his spirit. Moving to Beaumont, she established a multi-racial occult group called The Children, which dedicated itself to sex magic rituals with the intent of producing mixed-race \"moon children\" who would be devoted to the god Horus. The group soon dissolved, largely because many of its members became concerned by Cameron's increasingly apocalyptic predictions.\nReturning to Los Angeles, Cameron befriended the socialite Samson De Brier and established herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community. Among her friends were the filmmakers Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger. She appeared in two of Harrington's films, The Wormwood Star and Night Tide, as well as in Anger's film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. In later years, she made appearances in art-house films created by John Chamberlain and Chick Strand. Rarely remaining in one place for long, during the 1950s and 1960s she lived in Joshua Tree, San Francisco and Santa Fe. In 1955, she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel. Although intermittent health problems prevented her from working, her art and poetry resulted in several exhibitions. From the late 1970s until her death from cancer in 1995, Cameron lived in a bungalow in West Hollywood, where she raised her daughter and grandchildren, pursued her interests in esotericism, and produced artwork and poetry.\nCameron's recognition as an artist increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron\u2013Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote her work, and in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published."

He attended Adrian College and enlisted at thirteen in the Sixteenth Regiment of the Michigan Volunteer Infantry in the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War. At Gaines' Mill, a musket ball struck him in the breast; he was taken prisoner and held for six weeks at Libby Prison before being exchanged. Later he served at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, and, after re-enlisting in 1864, took part in the Petersburg campaign. Over three years, from 1862 to 1865, he was wounded five times, and rose to the rank of major by the time he was seventeen. His two brothers both died in the war. He graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was admitted to the bar.\nHe set up practice in Hastings, Nebraska, in 1872 and was a member of the Nebraska constitutional convention of 1875. He was elected as a Republican to fill the newly created 2nd district seat to the U.S. House of Representatives to the Forty-eighth United States Congress. He supported the moderate coinage of silver and favored revision of the high protective tariff, but not to the extent that would make him support either the Morrison tariff bill of 1886 or the Mills tariff bill of 1888. In that respect, he stayed safely in the good graces of the national party, and beat Democratic challengers easily, even with Prohibition third party candidates carrying somewhere between three and ten percent of the vote in a congressional race. As a member of the Military Affairs Committee, he pushed through a bill to make provision for homes for disabled soldiers in every state in the Union. He also served on the Pensions committee. As one senator said later, \"No ex-soldier ever appealed to him in vain, and his generous nature could refuse nothing to the suffering or dependent.\" Breaking with other members of the Republican party, Laird strove to clear the name of General Fitz John Porter, who had been his old commanding general. \"There was in his voice the sound of the ring of the saber,\" Congressman Byron Cutcheon of Michigan commented, \"there was in his utterances the rattle of small arms in battle.\" Certainly one fellow congressman had cause to feel so that summer, when Laird took out a grievance by socking him in the mouth.He was re-elected three times serving from March 4, 1883, but after his re-election in 1888 had a nervous breakdown, complicated by insomnia; as a result, he never took his seat in the lame-duck session of the Fiftieth Congress and had no chance to attend the Congress that followed it. He died on August 17, 1889, in Hastings, aged 40. Laird is buried in Hastings' Parkview Cemetery.\nLaird is the namesake of the community of Laird, Colorado."

But he also realized that it was a double-edged sword, in that education would reduce the isolation of Sorbian culture, making it more vulnerable to outside (mostly German) influence."

After the Continuation War Virolainen moved to Lohja, but he remained one of the leaders of the evacuated Karelians, and never gave up the hope that Soviet Union and later Russia would return Finnish Karelia to Finland. After World War II Virolainen became the first president of the Maaseudun Nuorten Liitto later known as Finnish Centre Youth, which has been educating tens of ministers and hundreds of members of the Finnish Parliament.He was also famous as a teetotaller, saying that the only circumstance where he would countenance downing a toast would be if Karelia was ceded back to Finland. He was fond of repeating the line, and it has been claimed that he said it to, among others, Nikita Khrushchev and Anastas Mikoyan on the Soviet side, to fend off needling by them for lacking the Soviet style of social graces.\nA member of the Agrarian League (later the Centre Party), Virolainen was a Member of Parliament 1945\u20131983 and 1987\u20131991.He had a long ministerial career, serving as Assistant Minister of the Interior 1950\u20131951; Minister at the Council of State Chancellery 1951, and 1956\u20131957; Minister of Education 1953, 1954, 1956\u20131957, and 1968\u20131970; Minister of Foreign Affairs 1954\u20131956, 1957, and 1958; Deputy Prime Minister 1957, 1958, 1962\u20131963, 1968\u20131970, and 1977\u20131979; Minister of Agriculture 1961\u20131963; Minister of Finance 1972\u20131975; and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry 1976\u20131979.Virolainen was Prime Minister from 1964\u20131966, presiding over a coalition government comprising the Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Swedish People's Party, and Finnish People's Party. He also served as Speaker of the Parliament from 1966\u20131968 and 1979\u20131983. Virolainen is considered one of the strongest Centre Party leaders in the post-war era, second only to Urho Kekkonen.\nVirolainen had a variable, often tense relationship with President Kekkonen, who considered him an unreliable, too frequently opinion-changing politician (Juhani Suomi, \"A Ski Trail Being Snowed In:  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981\" / Umpeutuva latu.  Urho Kekkonen 1976-1981, Helsinki:  Otava Publishing Ltd., 2000).  Virolainen himself claimed that the two basic reasons for their tense relationship were that he had never been a member of the right-wing, nationalist Academic Karelia Society (Kekkonen had, until 1932), and that he was a teetotaller (Kekkonen drank and at times smoked).  Moreover, Kekkonen was unconvinced that Virolainen always supported his official foreign policy toward the Soviet Union.  In June 1979, he publicly rebuked Virolainen, who was then Speaker of Parliament, for \"bearing a false testimony\" about Finland's foreign policy, and for harming Finland's international relations.  Shortly before this harsh accusation, Virolainen had suggested in an interview by the Suomen Kuvalehti magazine that the National Coalition Party had remained in the opposition despite its major victory in the 1979 parliamentary elections because of \"general reasons\" or foreign policy.\nAfter Kekkonen resigned in October 1981, Virolainen became the Centre Party's presidential candidate, but he was handily defeated in the 1982 presidential elections by the Social Democratic candidate, Mauno Koivisto.  In the 1983 parliamentary elections, Virolainen was one of the major-party deputies to lose their seats because of allegations that he had illegally received the parliamentary daily allowance for commuting between Helsinki and his official hometown.  Determined to finish his parliamentary career in style, he was re-elected to Parliament in the 1987 parliamentary elections.  During his last electoral term, Virolainen supported constitutional amendment proposals that reduced the President's power.During his nine-year retirement from Parliament, Virolainen still actively followed the Finnish political affairs and sometimes gave interviews on current topics (the Finnish broadcasting corporation YLE \"Living Archives\" / El\u00e4v\u00e4 arkisto, search words:  \"Johannes Virolainen\").  He also wrote some volumes of political memoirs, including \"A Defence of Politics\" (Politiikan puolustus), \"From the Path\" (Polun varrelta), and \"The Pictures Move\" (Kuvat kulkevat)."

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of Nazi Germany.There is currently no official German Government list of KC recipients. Analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) indicates that up to 7,321 awards may have been made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 [The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945]. Fellgiebel was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, and was also the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, a second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of the recipients.\nIn 2007, Veit Scherzer published his Die Ritterkreuztr\u00e4ger 1939\u20131945 [The Knight's Cross Bearers 1939\u20131945]. Scherzer's book was compiled from documents held by the German Federal Archives, and cast doubt on 193 of the listings in Fellgiebel's 1996 book. The majority of the disputed recipients were listed as having received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of the Third Reich during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Listed here are the 368 Knight's Cross recipients of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS whose last name is in the range \"Ba\u2013Bm\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of 13 of these listings. This is the first of two lists of all 725 Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients whose last name starts with \"B\".

Also referred to as the \"romanticist on the throne\", he was deeply religious and believed that he ruled by divine right. He feared revolutions, and his ideal state was one governed by the Christian estates of the realm rather than a constitutional monarchy.\nIn spite of his conservative political philosophy, he initially pursued a moderate policy of easing press censorship, releasing political prisoners and reconciling with the Catholic population of the kingdom. During the German revolutions of 1848\u20131849, he was initially forced to accommodate the people's revolutionary sentiments, although he rejected the title of Emperor of the Germans offered by the Frankfurt Parliament in 1849, believing that it did not have the right to make such an offer. In December 1848 he dissolved the Prussian National Assembly when he found its constitutional proposals too radical. At the urging of his ministry, which wanted to prevent a renewal of unrest, he imposed a constitution with a parliament and a strong monarch. He then used the Prussian military to help put down revolutionary forces throughout the German Confederation.\nFrederick William IV had an artistic nature and an interest in architecture. He extended the building ensembles of the Berlin-Potsdam Residence Landscape, Museum Island, and the cultural landscape of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, and he supported the completion of the Cologne Cathedral. All are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nFrom 1857 to 1861, he suffered several strokes and was left incapacitated until his death.

He was the son and successor of Marinus I.\nAt the beginning of his reign, he warred against the Saracens and then made a treaty with them after they appeared beneath his walls in 929. He then allied with Lombards Atenulf III of Benevento, with whom he signed a pact, and Landulf I, joint-prince of Benevento, against the Byzantines. A Greek force was sent to Apulia and the rebellious vassals were constrained to recognise the authority of the emperor in Constantinople. John then confirmed a treaty with the princes salve fidelitate sanctorum imperatorum.\nIn 946, he allied with Landulf II of Benevento in an invasion of Salerno with the intent of deposing Prince Gisulf I. They were defeated by an army of Mastalus I of Amalfi and John retired to Naples. Landulf turned around and joined with Gisulf in attacking the Neapolitan duchy. They took Nola.\nIn 949, John made a donation to the church of Saints Severinus and Sossus, which had possibly been founded by one of his predecessors. In 950, he himself founded the church of Saint Michael Porta Nova in Naples. In 955, he attempted again to throw off the imperial yoke and again an army was sent to Italy under the strategos of Calabria and Langobardia, Marianos Argyros. Refused entry into Naples, it landed in the harbour and pillaged the city, forcing John to submit. In 962, however, John switched his allegiance to the new emperor in the West, Otto I. In 958, Naples was subject to another Muslim siege.\nJohn's wife was the Roman senatrix Theodora, daughter of the famous Theodora and Theophylact I, Count of Tusculum. John was thus related by marriage to the famed Marozia. He sent his son Landulf to be raised in Rome by Marozia. His sister Orania married Docibilis II of Gaeta, cementing alliance between Gaeta and Naples. His elder son, Marinus, would succeed him in Naples. In 944, Marinus was appointed co-duke, and, in that same year, Odo of Cluny visited and influenced John to affirm the possessions of the monasteries in his domains.\nJohn was a man of letters and an amateur philosopher. He and Theodora commissioned the archpriest Leo to go to Constantinople as ambassador and bring back as many Greek manuscripts as possible. Leo returned with the Chronographia of Theophanes, the Antiquities of the Jews by Flavius Josephus, De Prodigiis by Livy, the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and the Historia Alexandri Magni. After Theodora's death, John took to reading and theorising, contemplation and translation into Latin, according to Leo.\nAn interesting anecdote is told of this duke by Peter Damian. The legend probably dates from 981 and may have basis in historical fact. In a vision, John saw a group of devils leading a line of horses drawing carts full of hay for the purpose of burning Pandulf Ironhead, the deceased prince of Capua, and himself, still very alive. John decided then and there to abdicate, but only with the permission of the Emperor Otto II first. This he died before receiving."

He came from a family of government officials and studied law in Heidelberg and Berlin.  After graduation in 1876, Havenstein worked in the Prussian Justice service until 1887 when he began his career as a judge.  In 1890 he moved to the Prussian Ministry of Finance.  From 1900 to 1908, Havenstein was President of the Prussian State Bank.  From 1908 to 1923, he was president of the Reichsbank and his signature appears on German Reichsbank notes from 1908 to 1923.\nHavenstein played an important part in the hyperinflationary process in Germany since he subscribed to the widespread belief then present in Germany that the inflation was caused by the fall in the external value of the mark against foreign currencies and that the role of the Reichsbank was to print sufficient money to sustain the higher price levels.  The more money that was printed the higher the price level became, so the Reichsbank then printed even more money and so on.  In other words, rather than following the Quantity Theory of Money in ascribing inflation to the excessive printing of money, Havenstein believed that money had to be printed to feed the rising demand for money within the German economy as prices were driven up by the fall in the exchange rate.  It was Havenstein's death in November 1923 that helped to bring this policy to an end and, with it, the hyperinflation.Havenstein was involved in the introduction of war bonds at the beginning of the First World War.\nHe died in Berlin and is buried in St. Anne's Cemetery in Berlin-Dahlem."

De Ner\u00e9e's literary writing and art work was very much inspired by decadent and symbolist authors such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine or Gabriele d'Annunzio, and artists as de Feure, Goya, Johan Thorn Prikker, and Jan Toorop. He more and more focused on his art. Only posthumously, in 1916, two poems were publiced in a French periodical.\nIn 1901, the Ner\u00e9e worked in Madrid for Foreign Affairs He caught TBC, a disease that would determine his further life. In Madrid De Ner\u00e9e was visited by his friend Henri van Booven, the future biographer of Louis Couperus, who later gave a thinly veiled report of this visit in his novel Een liefde in Spanje ('A Love in Spain', 1928). De Ner\u00e9e also inspired Van Booven to write his volume of (prose) poems Witte Nachten ('White Nights', 1901) and the novel Tropenwee ('Tropical Agony', 1904), the latter being a Conrad-like report of his traumatic visit to the Belgian Congo.\nIn his turn Van Booven gave De Ner\u00e9e The Early Work (1899) by Aubrey Beardsley. This was obviously great influence  on De Ner\u00e9e's style of drawing.  Later, around 1904-1905, he developed his own unique style. The themes, usually 'femmes fatales' or clownesque figures, gold nuances and symbolism of these works often recall associations with the best wor He is one of the few 'decadent' Dutch representatives of the European symbolist movement.During his life he did not exhibit; he was a well-known society figure. Sometimes he gave friends drawings and around 1905 he sold several works to mainly German collectrots. \nDue to his poor health, drawing and painting became ever more difficult after 1906-1907. The little known works from his later period are characterized by their colors and modernist compositions. He died on 19 October 1909 at 29 years of age, in the southern German town of Todtmoos. He was buried in Clarens, near Montreux.\nThe nature of his work, the Beardsley-replication and the somewhat 'decadent' character, set de Ner\u00e9e naturally in a somewhat isolated position in art history. During the twentieth century, however his work was exhibited several times and he  has received a welldeserved small but firm place in European art history around 1900."

In 1914-1915, he informed the German government about Lenin\u00b4s plans and intended to use Bolshevik agitation to replace the Russian empire with a number of national states. Some earlier scholarship expressed skepticism, but other research has indicated that between 200,000 - 500,000 German Reichsmark was passed to Lenin by Germany using Kesk\u00fcla as a conduit.\nMichael Futrell interviewed Kesk\u00fcla whilst researching his book 1958-63. Here, Futrell records that although Kesk\u00fcla had only minimal contact with Lenin, he nevertheless passed money to him through another Estonian, Arthur Siefeldt, who drip fed the money into Bolsheviks hands by making a series of small secret donations. Other researches claim Kesk\u00fcla had given the Germans little of substance and he did not deliver any significant sums to the Bolsheviks.In 1918, he founded the Estonian Office in Stockholm to seek the support of the Entente states for Estonian independence. He acted in such status, until the official Estonian delegation forbade him to do that. The Estonian delegation was skeptical about Kesk\u00fcla and considered him a German agent.\nCentral in Kesk\u00fcla's thought was the region of Baltic Sea. According to Kesk\u00fcla's approach, Estonia had originally belonged to the Nordic region, but as a result of the German conquest in the 13th century it was included in the alien Central European cultural space. It then re-established its Nordic heritage in the 16-17th centuries and in the 18th century fell under the yoke of the even more alien Eastern European (Russian) sphere. Kesk\u00fcla thought that Estonia should separate from Russia and restore its place among the Nordic countries that were becoming increasingly unified.\nIn his later years, Kesk\u00fcla acted as the teacher of politics for several young Spanish scientists.\n\n\n== References =="

She married her colleague Pirro Marconi, whom she met in her studies in Athens.\nIn the 1920s she moved to Sicily, centering her work on its classical monuments. In 1939 she became the archaeological superintendent for western Sicily.She devoted herself to writing some publications on the civilization of the Conca d'Oro ('Golden Valley'), the fertile plain among mountains where Sicily's capital city Palermo is situated, and of the Grotta del Vecchiuzzo in Madonie Regional Natural Park. She remained the director of the Archaeological Superintendency of Western Sicily from the 1930s to the 1960s. During World War II she took charge of moving the exhibits kept at Palermo's Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas by personally relocating them to the convent of San Martino delle Scale in Monreale; in view of the great devastation that the museum suffered, this allowed them to save the greater part of the collection.\nAt the end of the war she was in charge of the museum's reconstruction and reorganization, so much so that if Antonio Salinas is the one who created the museum, Jole Bovio Marconi is considered the one who created it anew. She excavated and studied the Upper Paleolithic Grotta del Genovese on Levanzo in the Egadi Islands and Grotta dell'Addaura near Palermo (published in 1953). She was entrusted with the chair of prehistory at the University of Palermo, and she took charge of the restoration of the temple of Segesta. She planned and realized the anastylosis of Temple E in Selinunte. In 1963 she published the first paper on the late Neolithic to early Bronze Age Bell Beaker ware of Sicily, \"Sulla diffusione del vaso campaniforme in Sicilia\" (Kokalos 9, pp. 93\u2013128). In recognition of this work, the archaeologists Jean Guilaine, Sebastiano Tusa, and Primo Veneroso dedicated to her memory the paper La Sicile et l'Europe Campaniforme, with funds from the Coll\u00e8ge de France."

During his unusually varied career, Coates explored many different genres and styles of writing and produced three highly remarkable experimental novels, The Eater of Darkness (1926), Yesterday\u2019s Burdens (1933) and The Bitter Season (1946). Highly original and experimental, these novels draw upon expressionism, Dadaism and surrealism. His last two novels\u2014Wisteria Cottage (1948) and The Farther Shore (1955)\u2014are examples of crime fiction. Simultaneously to working as a novelist, Coates maintained a life-long career at the New Yorker, whose staff he joined in 1927. The magazine printed more than a hundred of his short stories many of which were collected in three anthologies; All the Year Round (1943), The Hour after Westerly (1957) and The Man Just ahead of You (1964).

The son of a government officer, he attended the Gymnasium in Ansbach. In 1846 he moved to Munich and received his technical and artistic education at the Polytechnical Institute and the Academy of Fine Arts.\nIn 1854 he entered the service of the Royal Bavarian State Railways, where he was concerned with building construction such as the modification of the station in  Gem\u00fcnden am Main.\nLeo von Klenze made him his assistant, and he worked in Klenze's office up to Klenze's death in 1864.\nDollmann completed the Befreiungshalle and expanded the Assyrian Hall in the Glyptothek courtyard. His first significant independent work was the neo-Gothic Church of the Holy Cross in Giesing (now part of Munich), which was built 1866\u20131883.\nThe concept of a magnificent building commissioned by King Maximilian II of Bavaria was not realized, but in 1868 he entered the service of his son King Ludwig II as an architect and saw a rapid career.\nIn 1869/1870, in five separate planning phases he designed the project of a Byzantine palace; however it was never realized.\nBetween 1870 and 1872 he expanded the hunting house in Linderhof by a U-shaped building complex, whose centre was the stately bedroom.\nBut this construction had to make place for a new Linderhof Palace, built 1874\u20131879.\nFrom 1868 Ludwig II commissioned a project for a new Versailles Palace in Linderhof Valley. From December 1868 till September 1873, Dollmann presented seventeen different floor plans and numerous front elevations as well as many drawings of the bedroom. In 1873 the project was transferred to the Herreninsel in Chiemsee. As Herrenchiemsee Palace it remains uncompleted.\nThe King's House on Schachen, a wooden post-and-beam construction, was built 1869\u20131872. In 1874, Dollmann took over the direction of the building activities at Neuschwanstein Castle (started in 1869) from Eduard Riedel.\nIn 1884 Dollmann fell from the king's favour.

In Berlin he could not reach a postdoctoral lecturer qualification because of his Jewish origin, so he became a private lecturer (Privatdozent) for political science and international law in Heidelberg.\nBut his inclinations to journalism soon won the upper hand, and, his living assured by his family, he gave up teaching.He was very much taken by the questions surrounding the movements of 1848.  His feeble attempts at practical politics nevertheless foundered and left him more and more to make himself known through his pen and his theories.  He spoke at the agitated mass meeting at Unter den Zelten where the legislature's petition to the king regarding the wishes of the people was discussed.  He became one of the chief editors, with Arnold Ruge and Eduard Meyen, of \u201cDie Reform\u201d (The Reform) which soon came under the oversight of several democratic groups. Among his other co-workers on this paper were Mikhail Bakunin, Karl Heinzen and Georg Herwegh. Oppenheim sought a seat in the National Assembly. He thought it sufficient to refer to his writings in \u201cDie Reform\u201d where he developed his premise \u201cthat only with freedom did the people become mature enough for freedom,\u201d but the people of Berlin had no patience with a candidate who campaigned only with his pen. This experience convinced him even more he that he was suited to a writing career, as he did not seem suited to speaking.He went to Baden and, looking for secrets, broke into the private files of the departed archduke.  Lorenzo Brentano, the leader of the provisional government, put him in charge of the government newspaper, the \u201cKarlsruher Zeitung\u201d.  When a schism broke out between Brentano's moderates and Gustav Struve's terrorists, Oppenheim worked for the latter, and was dismissed from the newspaper when they failed.  He then traveled to Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and England. He returned in 1850 and continued to publish works on democratic ideas.  He denounced the democrats for the victories of the Reaction, but thought the latter were ultimately to blame because they turned to raw despotic power rather than continuing with their phony constitutionalism.In 1861 Oppenheim joined the German Progress Party and edited the Yearbook for Politics and Literature which was banned soon afterwards. He also became a member of the Congress of German Economists, as he was known as an excellent economist and supporter of free trade. He also paid attention to social matters.\nThe occurrences of 1866 worked a great transformation in Oppenheim.  He greeted the new order with joy while other liberals were more skeptical.  Oppenheim joined the National Liberals and supported Bismarck's strategy for national unification. He wrote two flyers for the elections, one of which only saw limited distribution since the leaders saw it as too radical.  After 1870, for the first time he directly discussed practical questions, writing on poor laws and economics.  He was also critical of \u201cfanciful thinkers about the future among the teachers in the universities.\u201dIn the 1874 election, he was elected Member of the Reichstag representing Reu\u00df \u00e4. L. and took his seat as an expert on the 1869 changes to commercial regulations.  In 1877 he lost his seat to a social democrat.  In reaction to Bismarck's protectionist policy he split with his party in 1880.\nOppenheim's philosophical work is concentrated on parliamentarism the idea of common welfare. He coined the phrase \u201clectern socialism\u201d (German \"Kathedersozialismus\")."

She influenced other authors through her salon and also with her poetry, plays, and epigrams, often thematically tied to her lesbianism and feminism.\nBarney was born into a wealthy family. She was partly educated in France, and expressed a desire from a young age to live openly as a lesbian. She moved to France with her first romantic partner, Eva Palmer. Inspired by the work of Sappho, Barney began publishing love poems to women under her own name as early as 1900. Writing in both French and English, she supported feminism and pacifism. She opposed monogamy and had many overlapping long and short-term relationships, including on-and-off romances with poet Ren\u00e9e Vivien and courtesan Liane de Pougy and longer relationships with writer \u00c9lisabeth de Gramont and painter Romaine Brooks. \nBarney hosted a salon at her home in Paris for more than 60 years, bringing together writers and artists from around the world, including many leading figures in French, American, and British literature. Attendees of various sexualities expressed themselves and mingled comfortably at the weekly gatherings. She worked to promote writing by women and hosted a \"Women's Academy\" (L'Acad\u00e9mie des Femmes) in her salon as a response to the all-male French Academy. The salon closed for the duration of World War II while Barney lived in Italy with Brooks. She initially espoused some pro-fascist views, but supported the Allies by the end of the war. After the war, she returned to Paris, resumed the salon, and continued influencing or inspiring writers such as Truman Capote.\nBarney had a wide literary influence. Remy de Gourmont addressed public letters to her using the nickname l'Amazon (the Amazon), and Barney's association with both de Gourmont and the nickname lasted until her death. Her life and love affairs served as inspiration for many novels written by others, ranging from de Pougy's erotic French bestseller Idylle Saphique to Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, the most famous lesbian novel of the twentieth century."

As a professional baseball player, his major league career spanned from 1899 to 1914 in which he played mainly in the National League for seven teams over 12 seasons. His most notable time was with the New York Giants, where he starred in the outfield for John McGraw's 1904 pennant winners and 1905 World Series champions. One of the finest hitters of the dead-ball era, his .333 career batting average ranks 28th all time and he finished in the top three in batting five times. In each of those same seasons, he also finished in the top ten in the league in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and home runs.\nDonlin, who was given the nickname \"Turkey Mike\" for his unique strut, was a controversial character\u2014 his entertaining personality, flamboyant style of dress, and prodigious talent as a hitter caused him to be lionized as \"the baseball idol of Manhattan.\" However, alcoholism led to friction with club officials and incarceration. Donlin attempted to leverage his popularity as an athlete to launch a career in Broadway theatre where he met and married vaudeville comedian Mabel Hite in 1906. Together, they performed in the baseball-themed play Stealing Home for about three years.\nBetween the waning popularity of the play in 1911 and Hite's death the following year, Donlin attempted short-lived comebacks with the Giants, Boston Rustlers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. His forays into acting cut short an undeniable talent that could have been a much more successful major league career; he reached 100 games in just five of his major league seasons. After convincing McGraw to sign him for the last time in 1914, Donlin endured a disappointing 35-game cameo with the Giants, leading him to devote his efforts to launch his acting career. He migrated to Hollywood, where close friend John Barrymore helped him attain work. Although he made at least 53 appearances on film, the prospects of stardom never materialized. Donlin remained in Hollywood continuing in his acting career until his death in 1933."

His name is sometimes written Lansberg, and his first name is sometimes given as Philip or  Johannes Philippus.  He published under the Latin name Philippus Lansbergius.\nHe is best known as the author of a set of astronomical tables, Tabulae motuum coelestium perpetu\u00e6, for predicting planetary positions.  These were later found to contain certain errors, in part because he (erroneously) did not accept Kepler's discovery of elliptical orbits. He served as a Protestant clergyman.\nMartinus Hortensius was one of his students, and Landsberge subsequently collaborated with his former pupil.\nHe was born in Ghent in modern-day Belgium in 1561. He grew up in France and studied in England. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he moved to the northern part of the Netherlands. He stayed in Leiden for a short time, and then he went to Goes to become a preacher. Lansbergen lived there until 1613. In that year, he was fired because he did not agree with a mayoral election. The fifty-two-year-old Lansbergen decided to move to Middelburg to devote himself to astronomical research, which he did until the end of his life.\nLansbergen supported the heliocentric theory of Copernicus, who claimed that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This theory was controversial in both Catholic and Protestant circles, where the geocentric theory had been more widely held.\nHe married Sara Lievaerts in 1586 and they had six sons and four daughters. He had a great reputation, because of his rare knowledge and expertise. Not only in matters of the church, but even more in mathematics and physics. In 1611, his son Pieter (1587) became a preacher in Goes. Jacob, another son, moved to Goes as well, but became a medical doctor. Lansbergens' oldest son, also called Philippus, was a preacher in Kloetinge and died there in 1647.\nLansbergen wrote several books. One of those, \"Considerations about the daily and yearly movements of the Earth\", became a best-seller. One could say that Lansbergen was the first Dutch author that wrote a popular book about the movements of the planets around the Sun.\nKepler and Galileo, who lived in the same period, were very interested in the work of Lansbergen. Based on his tables, they could predict the movements of the planets more accurately.Lansbergen probably lived in the \"Spanjaardstraat\" in Middelburg. He had frequent contacts with sympathizers, like the Dutch poet Jacob Cats. Cats wrote three poems about the \"very wise, famous, and honored Philippus Lansbergen\".\nHe died in Middelburg in December 1632.\nThe Philippus Lansbergen Public Observatory in Middleburg is named after him, and so is the lunar crater Lansberg."

Most historians who have considered the question believe that his father was Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. Evidence from a 1998 DNA test showed that a descendant of Eston matched the Jefferson male line, and historical evidence also supports the conclusion that Thomas Jefferson was probably Eston's father. Many historians believe that Jefferson and Sally Hemings had six children together, four of whom survived to adulthood. Other historians disagree.Jefferson freed Eston and his older brother Madison Hemings in his will, as they had not yet come of age at his death. They each married and lived with their families and mother Sally in Charlottesville, Virginia, until her death in 1835. Both brothers and their young families moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, to live in a free state, where Eston Hemings earned a living as a musician and entertainer.\nIn 1852 Eston moved with his wife and three children to Madison, Wisconsin, where they changed their surname to Jefferson and entered the white community. Their sons both served in the Union Army, and the older one, John Wayles Jefferson, achieved the rank of colonel. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, becoming a wealthy cotton broker and never married.\nEston's other children, Beverly and Anna Jefferson, married into the white community, and their descendants have identified as white. Beverly Jefferson's five sons were educated and three entered the professional class as a physician, attorney, and manager at the railroad. One of their male-line descendants was tested in the 1998 DNA study that found the link to the Jefferson-male line."

        "content": "Hans W Pawlata, known as \"Edi\", was an Austrian pioneer of the sport of kayaking; who in 1927, claimed to be the first European to perform a Kayak roll, a skill developed by the Eskimo people. In fact, a number of other Europeans had already learned to roll a kayak, but Pawlata is widely credited with the feat.\nBorn 19 February 1900 in Vienna, Pawlata had a passion for paddling the faltbooten or folding kayaks that were popular in Europe after World War I. He studied written accounts of the kayaks and skills of the Greenlandic Inuit, especially the work of Knud Rasmussen, Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen. From his research, he designed a folding kayak which he believed was \"purebred\" and more faithful to the original Arctic boats. The 4.9 metre long kayak was built for him by the firm of Otto Hartel in Graz, and he called it \"Aijuk\". On 30 July 1927, on the Weissensee, he publicly demonstrated his ability to capsize his kayak and right it again without leaving the cockpit. The method he devised, which involved gripping the far end of the paddle blade, is now known as the Pawlata roll and is still used as a training or sea kayaking technique. In the following year, he published a book called \"Kipp kipp hurra! Im reinrassigen Kajak. Eine ausf\u00fchrliche Anleitung zum Sichwiederaufrichten im Kajak (Faltboot)\" (\"Tip tip hooray! In a purebred kayak. A detailed manual for righting oneself in a kayak (folding kayak)\") In it he says:\n\n\"Quite contrary to the expectations of the old experienced paddler, on 30 July 1927, I succeeded as the first European sportsman to right himself again after capsizing in a kayak. Thus was the curse of the centuries-old Eskimo secret broken and kayaking ceased to exist in name only.\"Actually, a number of European missionaries and explorers had previously learned how to roll from the Inuit of Greenland, Paul Egede probably being the first in the 1730s. Rolling was demonstrated in 1889 at Sandviken, Norway by Oluf Dietrichson, a member of Nansen's 1888 Greenland expedition.Pawlata died in Vienna on 13 December 1966.\n\n\n== References =="

Her mother Jacqueline Netter-Minne-Guerroudj and her stepfather Abdelkader Guerroudj, were both condemned to death as accomplices of Fernand Iveton, the only European who was guillotined for his part in the Algerian revolt. Her mother was never executed, partly due to a campaign on her behalf conducted by Simone de Beauvoir; her stepfather was also freed.\nDani\u00e8le Minne joined the struggle when she was 17, going underground under the nom de guerre of Djamila. Minne was considered a woman combatant in the Algerian War known as a fidayat. She \"planted at least two bombs during the Battle of Algeris, and joined the maquis in wilaya 3 in 1957\". A historian, Alistair Horne, described one of Minne's missions:   \"The targets were the Otomatic, a favourite students's bar on the Rue Michelet; the Cafeteria opposite (second time over) and the Coq-Hardi, a popular brasserie\u2026placed in the ladies' lavatory, Dani\u00e9le Minne's bomb in the Otomatic seriously injured a young girl and several others\".Arrested and jailed in December 1956, she was sentenced, on 4 December 1957, to 7 years in prison by a juvenile tribunal.\nFreed after independence in 1962, she wrote a PhD dissertation on the participation of Algerian women in the war, based on interviews with eighty-eight women between 1978 and 1986; the dissertation was later published as a book, Des femmes dans la guerre d\u2019Alg\u00e9rie (Karthala, Paris). The book was the basis for the film Algeria: Women at War by Parminder Vir.Dani\u00e8le Minne became Djamila Amrane by marriage in 1964.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 recipients in the military forces of allies of the Third Reich.These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 [The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945]. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had been nominated for the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Listed here are the 357 Knight's Cross recipients of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS whose last name is in the range \"Bn\u2013Bz\". Fellgiebel himself delisted one and Scherzer has challenged the validity of eight more of these listings. This is the second of two lists of all 725 Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients whose last name starts with \"B\". The recipients whose last name is in the range \"Ba\u2013Bm\" is listed at List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Ba\u2013Bm). The recipients are initially ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded."

He had previously served as the final Governor of the Republic of Maryland from 1855 until its annexation by Liberia on March 18, 1857.\nBorn in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1821, Drayton served as the black minister at St. John's Lutheran Church in Charleston under Minister John Bachman. In 1845, Drayton was sent by Bachman to serve as a missionary in Cape Palmas in the newly formed Republic of Maryland. He later pursued a career in politics, becoming the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland under Governor William A. Prout.In December 1855, Drayton ousted Prout, who had become increasingly unpopular, and assumed the governorship, later being unanimously elected in April 1856 as the Governor of Maryland. By December of that year, relations between the American settlers and the native Grebo population had deteriorated to the point of open warfare. As Maryland had less than 1,000 settlers and had poor financing, Drayton appealed to Liberia for assistance. In response, President Joseph Jenkins Roberts dispatched a militia force to put down the Grebo rebellion. Drayton soon negotiated the annexation of Maryland by Liberia and stepped down as governor on March 18, 1857.Drayton was later appointed Chief Justice of Liberia by President Stephen Allen Benson in 1861, serving until stepping down in 1864. He died in 1865 as a result of accidental drowning when his canoe capsized near Cape Palmas.\n\n\n== References =="

From 1802 to 1805, he worked in Philadelphia as the botanical manager of the extensive gardens of William Hamilton, Esq., \"The Woodlands.\" By 1805, he was working for Benjamin Smith Barton on a new flora of North America, under whom he studied the plants collected on the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  His work with Barton allowed him to travel farther afield. In 1805, he traveled south from Maryland to the Carolinas and, in 1806, he traveled north from the mountains of Pennsylvania to New Hampshire. He made both trips principally on foot, with only his dog and a gun, covering over three thousand miles each season.\nBarton's proposed flora was never written, but Pursh, who then moved to London, England, did make a major contribution to North American botany in his Flora americae septentrionalis; or A Systematic Arrangement and Description of The Plants of North America (variously dated as published in 1813 or 1814). He then returned to America, moving to Canada in 1816. He botanized a great deal in Quebec, but all the material he accumulated was destroyed by fire before it could be organized into suitable form for publication. His hopes of carrying out further major work were prevented by ill health due to alcoholism.\nHe was so destitute when he died in Montreal that his funeral expenses had to be defrayed by his friends. His remains lay in the Papineau Road cemetery until 1857, when they were moved to the Mount Royal Cemetery. A proper monument was paid for by subscription. It read as follows:\n\nFrederick Pursh,\nObt. 1820, AEt. 46.\nErected\nBy Members of the\nNatural History Society\nof Montreal\n1878.His name is commemorated in the genus Purshia (bitterbush) and in several species, e.g. Rhamnus purshiana."

He is the kicker of the university and in a game can punt from fifty to seventy yards.\nKernan also played four years for Harvard's baseball team, playing as both a pitcher and catcher.  He was also a high jumper for the track team and, in 1903, won the intercollegiate championship with a high jump of six feet and one inch.

He was in the graduating class of 1771, with William Graham, the rector of Liberty Hall Academy (now Washington & Lee University) and Henry \"Light Horse\" Lee, governor of Virginia and father of Robert E.

The younger Smith, who was ordained and elected president of Hampden\u2013Sydney on the same day his brother resigned, managed to revive the flagging enterprise, and, with the assistance of Trustee Patrick Henry, then Governor of Virginia, persuaded the  General Assembly of Virginia to grant a charter in 1783 \u2013 bestowing the power to grant degrees and establish a self-perpetuating Board.

He gained a degree at the university of Giessen and then, accused by authorities in the Grand Duchy of Hesse of being subversive, he fled, first to Zurich, where he received a degree in medicine before being expelled in 1836 for politics and duelling; in 1837 he arrived in London, where he eked out a living teaching German, but gained a reputation by his contributions to medical and scientific journals and made friendships with geologists Charles Lyell and Richard Owen among others. Recommendations put him aboard the Tory bound for New Zealand, travelling in the capacity of surgeon, surveyor and naturalist.\nDuring the 1840s he was a correspondent of Charles Darwin, whose Journal of Researches Dieffenbach translated into German and published, with Darwin's notes and corrections, as Naturwissenschaftliche Reisen (Brunswick, 1853). Darwin knew Dieffenbach's paper on the Chatham Islands, contributed to the journal of the Royal Geographical Society, and he particularly noted Dieffenbach's commentary on the differences between the species of birds there and in New Zealand. Dieffenbach also translated the Geological Manual of Henry De la Beche. Partly as a result of these efforts, in 1850 he was named adjunct professor of geology at Giessen, a post he held until his death there.\nThe extinct Dieffenbach's rail (Gallirallus dieffenbachii) a flightless rail formerly endemic to the Chatham Islands, was named after him. (The plant genus Dieffenbachia was named after the head gardener of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, Joseph Dieffenbach (1796\u20131863).)"

Petipa is one of the most influential ballet masters and choreographers in ballet history.\nMarius Petipa is noted for his long career as Premier ma\u00eetre de ballet (First Ballet Master) of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, making him Ballet Master and principal choreographer of the Imperial Ballet (today known as the Mariinsky Ballet), a position he held from 1871 until 1903. Petipa created over fifty ballets, some of which have survived in versions either faithful to, inspired by, or reconstructed from the original. Among these works, he is most noted for The Pharaoh's Daughter (1862); Don Quixote (1869); La Bayad\u00e8re (1877); Le Talisman (1889); The Sleeping Beauty (1890); The Nutcracker (choreographed jointly with Lev Ivanov) (1892); Le R\u00e9veil de Flore (1894); La Halte de cavalerie (1896); Raymonda (1898); Les Saisons (1900), and Les Millions d\u2019Arlequin (a.k.a. Harlequinade) (1900).\nPetipa revived a substantial number of works created by other choreographers. Many of these revivals would go on to become the definitive editions on which all subsequent productions would be based. The most famous of these revivals were Le Corsaire, Giselle, La Esmeralda, Copp\u00e9lia, La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e (with Lev Ivanov), The Little Humpbacked Horse and Swan Lake (with Lev Ivanov).Many pieces have survived in an independent from Petipa's original works and revivals in spite of the fact that the full-length ballets that spawned them had disappeared from the Imperial Ballet's repertoire. Many of these pieces have endured in versions either based on the original or choreographed anew by others \u2013 the Grand Pas classique, Pas de trois and Mazurka des enfants from Paquita; Le Carnaval de Venise Pas de deux; The Talisman Pas de deux; La Esmeralda Pas de deux; the Diana and Act\u00e9on Pas de deux; La Halte de Cavalerie Pas de deux; the Don Quixote Pas de deux; La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e Pas de deux; and the Harlequinade Pas de deux.\nAll of the full-length works and individual pieces which have survived in active performance are considered to be cornerstones of the ballet repertory."

One of the Five Members whose attempted arrest in January 1642 was a major step in sparking the First English Civil War, his use of procedure to out manoeuvre opponents was unusual for the period. Though this meant he was respected by contemporaries rather than admired, in 1895 historian Goldwin Smith described him as \"the greatest member of Parliament that ever lived\".Pym's father died when he was seven months old, and he was raised by his stepfather Sir Anthony Rous, from whom he inherited his Puritan views and deep opposition to the reforms of Archbishop William Laud. He was also a leading member of the Providence Island Company, which attempted to establish a Puritan colony in Central America.\nDescribed as 'a true revolutionary', he led the opposition to arbitrary rule first under James I, then Charles I. His leadership in the early stages of the war was essential to the Parliamentarian cause, particularly his role in negotiating the Solemn League and Covenant with the Scots Covenanters; his death from cancer in December 1643 was considered a major blow.Originally buried in Westminster Abbey,  after the Stuart Restoration in 1660, his body was dumped in a pit at nearby St Margaret's, Westminster along with those of other Parliamentary leaders. Though his reputation later suffered in comparison to less complex figures like John Hampden and Viscount Falkland, he is now viewed as an astute politician and effective speaker. Many of his ideas were adopted by Patriots during the American Revolution and 19th-century American liberals."

Historian Michael Joseph Corcoran has stated that she was \"The Mother of Tejano Music\", an art form that is the uniquely Texas cultural amalgamation of traditional Mexican, Spanish, German, and Czech musical roots. She recorded on numerous labels over the course of her six-decade career of live performing. The aggregate total of her records numbers an estimated 200 different Spanish-language songs on at least 50 LP record albums. In 1977, she performed at the Inauguration of President Jimmy Carter, as part of the line-up for the Inaugural Folk Dance and Concert. Her most well-known tune was \"Mal Hombre\" (Bad Man), a song she had heard as a child.\nShe was born in Houston, Texas, into a Mexican musical family originally from San Luis Potos\u00ed. The family had fled Mexico at the onset of the Mexican Revolution, after which they returned home for two years. When she was four years old, the family once again immigrated to Texas. Although she lived most of her life in the United States, primarily Texas, she never spoke any language but Spanish. The family moved frequently to find work and entertained other migrant workers wherever they went.\nMendoza was known by many nicknames, such as \"La Alondra de la Frontera\" (The Meadowlark of the Border). In their early years of performing, \"La Familia Mendoza\" (the Mendoza family) would hitchhike around south Texas, performing for farm laborers. Answering an advertisement in a Spanish-language newspaper resulted in their first recording sessions with Okeh Records. She was only 12 years old, but Lydia provided vocals and played the mandolin for the recordings. They eventually caught the notice of San Antonio radio personality Manuel J. Cortez and were offered a recording contract with the RCA Victor subsidiary of Bluebird Records. During World War II, and for several years afterward, Mendoza and her sisters Juanita and Marie performed as Las Hermanas Mendoza (the Mendoza sisters). She fairly quickly emerged as the headliner of the group, but her family continued to perform with her as she toured. Not only did she perform throughout the United States, but also in Canada and Latin America, where her attendance records were estimated to be 20,000.\nShe was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1984, she was inducted into the Tejano Music Hall of Fame, and in 1991, into the Conjunto Music Hall of Fame. For her contributions to the performing arts, she was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by First Lady Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton, and in 2003 she was bestowed with the Texas Cultural Trust's Texas Medal of Arts. She designed and sewed her own stage costumes, and at one point was an instructor at California State University, Fresno. Mendoza was married twice and the mother of three daughters. Ever the consummate live entertainer, she twice retired from performing but resumed singing both times. A stroke in her 60s finally brought an end to her career."

A native of York, Pennsylvania, Snyder was listed as 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and 175 pounds (79 kg).\nSnyder entered baseball in 1950 as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies' organization; his career interrupted by military service during the Korean War, he never played for the Phillies. But at the end of the 1958 minor-league season, he was traded to the Dodgers along with fellow pitcher Jim Golden and veteran outfielder Rip Repulski for Sparky Anderson, the future Hall-of-Fame manager, who was then a young second baseman in the Dodger farm system.\nSnyder gained a spot on the 1959 Dodgers' roster and pitched sporadically during the season's first four months.  After winning his debut game with 32\u20443 innings of relief against the St. Louis Cardinals in a wild 17\u201311 Dodger triumph on April 26 at Busch Stadium, he was given two starting assignments by Dodger manager Walter Alston.\nOn May 2, against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field, Snyder hurled two scoreless innings before being driven from the mound in the fourth, when the Reds erupted for seven runs. Snyder took the loss in a 16\u20134 Cincinnati rout. Four days later, against the Milwaukee Braves at County Stadium, Snyder was far more effective; despite issuing five bases on balls, he allowed only one unearned run in five innings pitched and exited with a 4\u20131 lead. But he was denied his second major-league victory when the Dodger bullpen faltered and allowed the Braves to come back to win, 5\u20134. Milwaukee and Los Angeles would finish in a dead heat at the end of the year, necessitating a three-game tie-breaker series to determine the National League champion.\nThe Dodgers would win that tie-breaker and the 1959 World Series championship, but Snyder's last appearance for them happened July 14, when he was touched for three earned runs in only one-third of an inning in a 9\u20131 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He worked in nine games for the Triple-A Spokane Indians in 1959, then spent three more years in the minor leagues before retiring after the 1962 season.\nIn his 11 big-league games, Snyder posted a 1\u20131 record and an earned run average of 5.47.

        "content": "Fran\u00e7ois Douaren (or le Douaren) (also sometimes spelled Duaren; Latin: Franciscus Duarenus) (1509, near Saint-Brieuc \u2013 1559, Bourges) was a French jurist and professor of law at the University of Bourges.\nAfter studies in Paris under Bud\u00e9 and in Bourges, Douaren worked as an advocate for the Parlement of Paris. In 1538, he was called to teach at Bourges. Following a bitter dispute with Baro, he abandoned the chair for Paris until Baro's death in 1550, after which Douaren returned to teach at Bourges.\nLike his compatriots Jacques Cujas, Fran\u00e7ois Hotman and Hugues Doneau, Douaren was one of the leading representatives of the legal humanist school of thought within the science of Roman law on the European continent. These 16th-century French law professors applied the philological methods of the Italian humanists to legal texts. It was their aim to arrive at a historically more accurate understanding of the texts of the Roman Corpus Iuris Civilis.\nIn addition to numerous commentaries on the Corpus, Douaren wrote a leading commentary on the Roman law of obligations, Commentarius de pactis (1544), which greatly influenced modern theories of obligations. His 1544 programme of studies, De ratione docendi discendique iuris epistola, was the first statement of the mos gallicus, the French Humanist approach to higher education. Its core contents \u2013 language studies, introductory classes on the base of the Justinian Code, a methodical approach based on the laws of the Corpus \u2013 came to be introduced at most European legal faculties."

A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) found Misirkov to be \"the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century\". For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered \"the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language\".On the other hand, he was one of the founders of the pro-Bulgarian Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Circle established in 1900 in St. Petersburg. In 1905 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective in the IMARO-affiliated press. In his diary written during the Balkan Wars, he espoused pro-Bulgarian views. During the First World War, he became a member of the local parliament in Bessarabia as a representative of the Bulgarian minority there. During the 1920s he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Misirkov returned to Macedonian nationalism for a period in 1914 and again in 1924 and 1925. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the Sofia Central Cemetery with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured Bulgarian educator.\nBecause Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remain a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. While Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to historian Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the other Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia, Macedonians."

Together with Bona Sforza (1494\u20131557), she is regarded as one of the most influential and powerful queen consorts of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nBorn in Nevers to Charles I, Duke of Mantua and Catherine of Guise, Marie was brought up at the French court as the future bride of Duke Gaston of Orl\u00e9ans. In 1645, she married W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV of Poland with whom she did not have a harmonious relationship. After his death in 1648, the widowed queen married his half-brother and successor, John II Casimir. Marie Louise exuded considerable influence over her second husband and dictated the political course in the country. An ambitious and energetic woman, she was a strong supporter of an absolute monarchy for which she was reviled by certain spheres of the Polish nobility. She, nevertheless, remained active in the Commonwealth's politics and co-sponsored the foundation of the first Polish newspaper, Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny (Polish Mercury Ordinary), in 1661 as well as other public institutions.\nWhile her role is regarded as crucial in repulsing the foreign forces out of Poland-Lithuania during the Swedish Deluge (1655\u20131660), she became increasingly unpopular for her absolutist policies and her intention of nominating her niece's husband, Henri Jules, the future Prince of Cond\u00e9, the heir apparent to the Polish throne. That resulted in a military conflict with the internal opposition, which ended with the defeat of the royal army in 1666, during the Lubomirski rebellion. After Marie Louise's death, John Casimir hesitatingly renounced the crown, and the Commonwealth government officially curtailed the prerogatives of the royal consort."

He was considered by Vasari to be second only to Liberale da Verona among artists in his town. His son Francesco Morone was also a prominent Veronese painter. His pupils included Michele da Verona and Girolamo dai Libri.\nDomenico Morone is known from a few panels, mainly depicting public festivals or tournaments with crowds of small figures. One of his masterpieces is the canvas celebrating the Cacciata dei Bonacolsi (1494) (or Expulsion of the Bonacolsi in 1328, scene of Piazza Sordello, Mantua) in the Ducal Palace of Mantua. Two small cassone panels depicting the Rape of Sabine women dated to c.1490 and attributed to Morone were bought by the National Gallery, London in 1886 and remain in its collections.  He was particularly prolific at the church of San Bernardino, Verona, painting a Madonna for the shutters of its organ (acquired with the Edward Solly collection by Berlin State Museums) and producing the frescoes for its chapel of Sant' Antonio, as well as leading the project to fresco its Franciscan library, with several of the central library frescoes painted by Morone himself.\n\n\n== References =="

Following his retirement, he was succeeded at Innsbruck by Arthur March (1891\u20131957).\nHis scientific research largely dealt with the specifics of thermodynamics and electromagnetism. He was the author of well-regarded books on the electromagnetic theory of light and electric potential.\n\nElektromagnetische Theorie des Lichtes, (1883) - Electromagnetic theory of light.\nDas Potential und seine Anwendung zu der Erkl\u00e4rung der elektrischen Erscheinungen, (1884) - Potential and its application to the explanation of electrical phenomena.In 1908 Tumlirz described careful and effective experiments which demonstrated the effect of the rotation of the Earth on the outflow of water through a central aperture, in a paper entitled \"New physical evidence on the axis of rotation of the earth\"."
