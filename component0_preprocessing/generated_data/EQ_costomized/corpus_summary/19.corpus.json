        "content": "Adam Smith  (baptized  1723 \u2013 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist and philosopher who was a pioneer of political economy and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Also known as \"The Father of Economics\" or \"The Father of Capitalism\", he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole."

        "content": "Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy  (; ; 21 August 178923 May 1857) was a French mathematician, engineer, and physicist who made pioneering contributions to several branches of mathematics, including mathematical analysis and continuum mechanics. He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra. A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors; Hans Freudenthal stated: \"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy).\" Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics."

        "content": "Friedrich August von Hayek   ( , ; 8 May 189923 March 1992), often referred to by his initials F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist, and philosopher who is best known for his defence of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for their work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals coordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics, leading to his prize. Hayek served in World War I during his teenage years and said that this experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war drew him into economics. At the University of Vienna, he studied economics, eventually receiving his doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and in political science in 1923. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany; he became a British subject in 1938. Hayek's academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, and later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. Although he is widely considered a leader of the Austrian School of Economics, he also had close connections with the Chicago School of Economics. Hayek was also a major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th century and as the co-founder of Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has sold over 2.25\u00a0million copies (as of 2020). Hayek was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush. In 2011, his article \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the American Economic Review during its first 100 years."

Throughout his career, Belushi had a personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicago's Second City comedy club. Born in Chicago to Albanian American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called \"The West Compass Trio\". After being discovered by Bernard Sahlins, he performed with The Second City and met Aykroyd, Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis. In 1975, Belushi was recommended to SNL creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels by Chevy Chase and Michael O'Donoghue, who accepted Belushi as a new cast member of the show after an audition. He developed a series of characters on the show that reached high success, including his performances as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van Beethoven. Belushi's Albanian ancestry lent itself to his \"Olympia Restaurant\" sketch (in which he sold nothing but \"cheeseburgers, cheeps [potato chips] and Pepsi\"). After his breakout film role as John Blutarsky in National Lampoon's Animal House (1978), Belushi appeared in films such as 1941, The Blues Brothers, and Neighbors. He also pursued interests in music, creating with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, Paul Shaffer, and The Blues Brothers, from which the film received its name. In his personal life, Belushi struggled with heavy drug use that threatened his comedy career; he was dismissed and rehired at SNL on several occasions due to his behavior. In 1982, Belushi died from combined drug intoxication possibly caused by Cathy Smith, who injected him with a mixture of heroin and cocaine known as a speedball at the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood, California. He was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004."

        "content": "Robert Zubrin (; born April 9, 1952) is an American aerospace engineer, author, and advocate for human exploration of Mars. He and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal in a 1990 research paper intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey.  A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their \"design reference mission\". He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Apollo program-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter. Disappointed with the lack of interest from government in Mars exploration and after the success of his book The Case for Mars (1996), as well as leadership experience at the National Space Society, Zubrin established the Mars Society in 1998. This is an international organization advocating a human mission to Mars as a goal, by private funding if possible."

        "content": "Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi ( \u2013 May 17, 1510), known as Sandro Botticelli (, ), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance.  Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th  century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting. In addition to the mythological subjects for which he is best known today, Botticelli painted a wide range of religious subjects (including dozens of renditions of the Madonna and Child, many in the round tondo shape) and also some portraits. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera, both in the Uffizi in Florence. Botticelli lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence; his only significant times elsewhere were the months he spent painting in Pisa in 1474 and the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1481\u201382. Only one of Botticelli's paintings, the Mystic Nativity (National Gallery, London) is inscribed with a date (1501), but others can be dated with varying degrees of certainty on the basis of archival records, so the development of his style can be traced with some confidence.  He was an independent master for all the 1470s, which saw his reputation soar. The 1480s were his most successful decade, the one in which his large mythological paintings were completed along with many of his most famous Madonnas.  By the 1490s his style became more personal and to some extent mannered. His last works show him moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and the new generation of painters creating the High Renaissance style, and instead returning to a style that many have described as more Gothic or \"archaic.\""

Following the suppression of the United Irish uprising in 1798, he sought to organise a renewed attempt to overthrow the British Crown and Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland, and to establish a nationally representative government. Emmet entertained, but ultimately abandoned, hopes of immediate French assistance and of coordination with radical militants in Great Britain. In Ireland many of the surviving veterans of '98 hesitated to lend their support, and his rising in Dublin in 1803 proved abortive. Emmet\u2019s Proclamation of the Provisional Government to the People of Ireland, his Speech from the Dock, and his \"sacrificial\" end on the gallows inspired later generations of Irish republicans. Patrick Pearse, who in 1916 was again to proclaim a provisional government in Dublin, declared Emmet's attempt \"not a failure, but a triumph for that deathless thing we call Irish Nationality\"."

In boxing, he was nicknamed \"Big George\" and competed between 1967 and 1997. He is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. As an entrepreneur, he is known for the George Foreman Grill. After a troubled childhood, Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Having turned professional the next year, he won the world heavyweight title with a stunning second-round knockout of then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973. He defended the belt twice before suffering his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. Unable to secure another title opportunity, Foreman retired after a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977. Following what he referred to as a religious epiphany, Foreman became an ordained Christian minister. Ten years later he announced a comeback, and in 1994 at age 45 won the unified WBA, IBF, and lineal heavyweight championship titles by knocking out 26-year-old Michael Moorer. He dropped the WBA belt rather than face his mandatory title defense soon after, and following a single IBF title defense on June 28, 1995, Foreman renounced his title \u2013 the last major belt he ever held. He was 46 years and 169 days old, becoming the oldest world heavyweight champion in history.  Foreman is the oldest to ever win the world heavyweight boxing championship of major honors, and the second-oldest in any weight class after Bernard Hopkins (at light heavyweight). He retired in 1997 at the age of 48, with a final record of 76 wins (68 knockouts) and 5 losses. Foreman has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and International Boxing Hall of Fame. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Foreman as the eighth-greatest heavyweight of all time. In 2002, he was named one of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by The Ring. The Ring ranked him as the ninth-greatest puncher of all time. He was a ringside analyst for HBO's boxing coverage for 12 years until 2004. Outside boxing, he is a successful entrepreneur and known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill, which has sold more than 100 million units worldwide. In 1999, he sold the commercial rights to the grill for $138 million."

        "content": "Jomo Kenyatta (22 August 1978) was a Kenyan anti-colonial activist and politician who governed Kenya as its Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964 and then as its first President from 1964 to his death in 1978. He was the country's first indigenous head of government and played a significant role in the transformation of Kenya from a colony of the British Empire into an independent republic. Ideologically an African nationalist and conservative, he led the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party from 1961 until his death. Kenyatta was born to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu land affairs. During the 1930s, he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938, he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. He returned to Kenya in 1946 and became a school principal. In 1947, he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers. In 1952, he was among the Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence\u2014a view shared by later historians\u2014he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and was then exiled to Lodwar until 1961. On his release, Kenyatta became President of KANU and led the party to victory in the 1963 general election. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the transition of the Kenya Colony into an independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. Desiring a one-party state, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited KANU's only rival\u2014Oginga Odinga's leftist Kenya People's Union\u2014from competing in elections. He promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its European minority, although his relations with the Kenyan Indians were strained and Kenya's army clashed with Somali separatists in the North Eastern Province during the Shifta War. His government pursued capitalist economic policies and the \"Africanisation\" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries. Education and healthcare were expanded, while UK-funded land redistribution favoured KANU loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions. Under Kenyatta, Kenya joined the Organisation of African Unity and the Commonwealth of Nations, espousing a pro-Western and anti-communist foreign policy amid the Cold War. Kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by Daniel arap Moi. Kenyatta was a controversial figure. Prior to Kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, he was given the honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation, securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation. Conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, authoritarian, and neo-colonial, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption."

He was active in drawing Irish Catholics and Presbyterians together in the United cause, and in soliciting French assistance for a general insurrection. In November 1798, on his second attempt to land in Ireland with French troops and supplies, he was captured by British naval forces. The United Irish risings of the summer had already been crushed. Tone died in advance of his scheduled execution, probably, as modern scholars generally believe, by his own hand. Later generations were to regard Tone as the father of Irish Republicanism.

Tradition holds that Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BCE into a royal Jain family in Bihar, India. But many scholars believe this date to be as much as 100 years early. His mother's name was Trishala and his father's name was Siddhartha. They were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Mahavira abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of spiritual awakening, becoming an ascetic. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for twelve and a half years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and attained Moksha (liberation) in the 6th century BCE, although the year varies by sect. Historically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was an older contemporary of Gautama Buddha. Mahavira taught that observance of the vows of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of Anekantavada (many-sided reality): syadvada and nayavada. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by Indrabhuti Gautama (his chief disciple) as the Jain Agamas. The texts, transmitted orally by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of Svetambara Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in Digambara Jainism. Mahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the North Indian city of Mathura, and is dated from between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as Mahavir Janma Kalyanak and his nirvana (salvation) and also his first shishya (spiritual enlightenment) of Shri Gautama Swami is observed by Jains as Diwali."

He is known for his own political prominence as well as that of his children and was the patriarch of the Irish-American Kennedy family, which included President John F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy. Kennedy was born to a political family in East Boston, Massachusetts. He made a large fortune as a stock market and commodity investor and later rolled over his profits by investing in real estate and a wide range of business industries across the United States. During World War I, he was an assistant general manager of a Boston area Bethlehem Steel shipyard; through that position, he became acquainted with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In the 1920s, Kennedy made huge profits by reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios; several acquisitions were ultimately merged into Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) Studios. Kennedy increased his fortune with distribution rights for Scotch whisky. He owned the largest privately owned building in the country, Chicago's Merchandise Mart. Kennedy was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. President Roosevelt appointed Kennedy to be the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he led from 1934 to 1935. Kennedy later directed the Maritime Commission. Kennedy served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to late 1940. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Kennedy was pessimistic about Britain's ability to survive attacks from Nazi Germany. During the Battle of Britain in November 1940, Kennedy publicly suggested, \"Democracy is finished in England. It may be here [in the United States].\" After a controversy regarding this statement, Kennedy resigned his position. Kennedy was married to Rose Kennedy and had nine children. During his later life, he was heavily involved in the political careers of his sons. Three of Kennedy's sons attained distinguished political positions: John F. Kennedy (1917\u20131963) served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and as the 35th president of the United States, Robert F. Kennedy (1925\u20131968) served as the U.S. attorney general and as a U.S. senator from New York, and Ted Kennedy (1932\u20132009) also served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts."

Alkan was born in Dillingen, Saarland (then Prussia, now Germany), the son of Johannes Alkan and Johanna Bonn in a family of merchants and musicians. Through his mother he was a distant cousin of the composers Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Fanny Hensel and Giacomo Meyerbeer. It is unknown whether he was related to the French composer and pianist Charles-Valentin Alkan, but like the latter, he was a scion of Jewish families from the Moselle region. In 1938 the octogenarian Siegfried Alkan became a victim of the \"Kristallnacht\". His instruments were destroyed and he himself was beaten by Nazi hordes. In his last years he was forced to wear the yellow star. Many works of Siegfried Alkan seem to be lost. Still known are for example the compositions \"Gru\u00df an die Saar\" (Op. 32), \"O w\u00fcsstest du's\" (Op. 39), \"Neues Saarlied\" (Op. 91) and \"Ur-Gro\u00dfm\u00fctterchen\" (Op. 80), which was very popular in the time after World War I."

He was educated at Harrow School.  In 1823 he entered Oriel College, Oxford. In 1825 he became a scholar of Trinity College and also won the Ireland scholarship, and three years later he was elected fellow of Balliol College.  He became a member of the Inner Temple and practised on the western circuit, being made in 1841 recorder of Falmouth, Helston and Penzance. From 1837 to 1842 he was professor of political economy at Oxford in this capacity he delivered a course of lectures on the British Colonies in which he dealt with questions of emigration, employment of labour and the allotment of public lands.  The reputation he secured by these lectures had much to do with his appointment in 1847 as Assistant Under-Secretary for the colonies, and in the next year he became Permanent Under-Secretary.  In 1859 he was transferred to the permanent under-secretaryship for India, receiving the distinction of CB.  In 1870, Merivale was awarded the degree of DCL by Oxford University. He died in 1874 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Besides his Lectures on Colonization and Colonies (1841), he published Historical Studies (1865), and completed the Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis (1867); he wrote the second volume of the Life of Sir Henry Lawrence (1872) in continuation of Sir Herbert Edwardes's work. A tribute to his powers as an original thinker by his chief at the Colonial Office, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, is printed with a notice of his career which his brother contributed to the Transactions (1884) of the Devonshire Association."

        "content": "Jules \u00c9tienne Joseph Quicherat (13 October 1814 \u2013 8 April 1882) was a French historian and archaeologist. His father, a working cabinet-maker, came from Paray-le-Monial to Paris to support his large family; Quicherat was born there. He was fifteen years younger than his brother Louis, a great Latin scholar and lexicographer, who survived him. Although very poor, he was admitted to the College of Sainte-Barbe, where he received a thorough classical education. He showed his gratitude to this establishment by writing its history in three volumes, published between 1860 and 1864. At the end of his studies he hesitated for some time before deciding what career he would follow, until Jules Michelet put an end to his indecision by inspiring him with a taste for history. In 1835 Quicherat entered the \u00c9cole des Chartes; he left two years later at the head of the college. Once more inspired by the example of Michelet, who had just written an admirable work on Joan of Arc, he published the text of the two trials of Joan, adding much contemporary evidence on her heroism in his  (5 vols. 1841-1849), as well as half a volume of , in which it seems that the last word has been said on important points. From the 15th century he drew other inspirations. In 1844 he published memoirs of the adventures of a brigand, Rodrigue de Villandrando, which gradually grew into a volume full of fresh matter. He wrote full biographies of two chroniclers of Louis XI, one very obscure, Jean Castel, the other, Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who was, on the contrary, a remarkable politician, prelate and chronicler. Between 1855 and 1859 Quicherat published the works of the latter, most of which were now brought out for the first time. In addition to these he wrote Fragments in\u00e9dits de Georges Chastellain and Lettres, m\u00e9moires et autres documents relatifs \u00e0 la guerre du bien public en 1465. These works did not wholly occupy his time: in 1847 he inaugurated a course of archaeological lectures at the \u00c9cole des Chartes, and in 1849 was appointed professor of diplomatics at the same college. His teaching had exceptionally good results. Although he was not eloquent and had a nasal voice, his hearers were loath to miss any of his thoughtful teaching, which was unbiased and well expressed. Of his lectures the public saw only some articles on special subjects which were distributed in a number of reviews. Note should be made of a short treatise on  published in 1867; and a memoir  published in 1850, where he gives his theory on the use of stone arches important for the history of religious architecture. In an 1874 article on , he declared an exact date for the birth of Gothic architecture. Following the advice of his friends, he began to transcribe towards the end of his life his lectures on archaeology; but only the introductory chapters, up to the 11th century, were found among his papers. On the other hand, the pupils trained by him circulated his principles throughout France, recognizing him as the founder of national archaeology. In one point he seems to have taken a false step; with a warmth and pertinacity worthy of a better cause he maintained the identity of Caesar's Alesia with Alaise, and he died without becoming a convert to the opinion, now almost universally accepted, that Alise Sainte-Reine is the place where Vercingetorix capitulated. But even this error benefited science; some well directed excavations at Alaise brought many Roman remains to light, which were subsequently sent to enrich the museum at Besan\u00e7on. After 1871, his course of lectures on diplomatics having been given up, Quicherat, still professor of archaeology, was nominated director of the Ecole des Chartes. He filled this post with the same energy which he had shown in the many scientific commissions in which he had taken part. In 1878 he gave up his duties as professor, which then fell to the most conspicuous of his pupils, Robert de Lasteyrie. He died suddenly at Paris on April 8, 1882, a short time after having corrected the proofs of , published in the Revue Historique. After his death it was decided to bring out his hitherto unpublished papers; among these are some important fragments of his archaeological lectures, but his , with which he was occupied for many years, is missing."

The integration came as a result of Brown v. Board of Education. Eckford's public ordeal was captured by press photographers on the morning of September 4, 1957, after she was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Johnny Jenkins of the United Press (UP) showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day's startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the press. The best-known photograph of the event was taken by Will Counts of the Arkansas Democrat. His image was the unanimous selection for a 1958 Pulitzer Prize, but since the story had earned then-rival  Arkansas Gazette two other Pulitzer Prizes already, the Prize was awarded to another photographer for a pleasant photograph of a two-year-old boy in Washington, D.C. A different photo taken by Counts of Alex Wilson, a black reporter for the Memphis Tri-State Defender being beaten by the angry mob in Little Rock the same day, was chosen as the \"News Picture of the Year\" for 1957 by the National Press Photographers Association. This image by Counts prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to Little Rock. Eckford only spent one year at Little Rock Central High where she and the other black students were tormented throughout. In the years since, she has struggled through life, and twice attempted suicide. She was subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder."

He established many championship scoring records, including being the top championship goal-scorer of all time with 59 goals. Rackard is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game. Born in Killane, County Wexford, Rackard was introduced to sport by his father who had hoped he would become a cricketer. His uncle, John Doran, won an All-Ireland medal as a Gaelic footballer with Wexford in 1918 and it was hurling and Gaelic football that Rackard developed a talent for. Rackard played competitive hurling as a boarder at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny. Here he won back-to-back Leinster medals in 1938 and 1939, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. By this stage Rackard had started playing for the local Rathnure St. Anne's club, winning a county junior championship medal in 1940. As a member of the club's senior team he won four county senior championship medals. Rackard made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was selected for the Wexford minor panel. He was just out of the minor grade when he was selected for the Wexford senior team in 1940. Over the course of the next seventeen years, Rackard won two All-Ireland medals as part of the Wexford hurling breakthrough in 1955 and 1956. He also won four Leinster medals, one National Hurling League medal and one Leinster medal as a Gaelic footballer. He played his last game for Wexford in August 1957. By the late 1940s, Rackard was a regular in the full-forward line on the Leinster inter-provincial team. Success came in the twilight of his career and he claimed his sole Railway Cup medal in 1956. Rackard's brothers, Billy and Bobby, also enjoyed All-Ireland success with Wexford. In retirement from playing Rackard became involved in team management and coaching. It was with the Wexford senior team that he enjoyed his greatest successes as a selector when, in 1968, he helped the team secure the All-Ireland title. Rackard was most famous for his scoring prowess and was the all-time top championship scorer at the time of his retirement from hurling. His private life was marred by periods of excessive drinking, which had started during his university studies, and eventually developed into alcoholism. After quitting drinking completely in 1970, Rackard travelled the country as a counsellor with Alcoholics Anonymous. In an interview in the Irish Press in 1975, he detailed his life as a recovering alcoholic and became one of the first sportspeople to break the taboo of alcoholism in Ireland. Rackard's death from cancer in April 1976 saw a huge outpouring of grief amongst the hurling community. He was posthumously honoured by being named on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984, however, he was sensationally omitted from the Hurling Team of the Millennium in favour of Ray Cummins."

A native of the Duchy of Kiev as a young man David entered the Kyiv Caves Lavra, where he was tonsured a hieromonk and given the religious name Dionysius. He is known to have spent a number of years living in a cave that he dug out himself on the banks of the Volga River not far from Nizhny Novgorod. Later, Dionysius founded the Pechersky Monastery on that same spot, which was dedicated in honour of the Ascension of the Lord. In 1374, he was consecrated the Bishop of Suzdal and won love and respect on the part of the locals. In 1378, Dionysius was recommended as Metropolitan of Kyiv by St. Sergius of Radonezh after the death of Metropolitan Alexius. However, Grand Prince Dmitri Donskoi had his own candidate \u2013 a priest by the name of Mikhail (Mityaya). Dionysius was one of a number of bishops at the council who opposed Mikhail, who was suspected of heresy (Strigolniki). If elected, Mikhail wanted to introduce a new way of enthroning the Metropolitan at home, in Russia, rather than traveling to Constantinople to be installed by the Ecumenical Patriarch (at the time, Russia was not yet an autocephalous church). In 1379 Dionysius went to Constantinople carrying a protest against the choice of Mikhail addressed to the Patriarch. Mikhail was afraid that Dionysius would get the patriarch's blessing and followed him to Constantinople. However, Mikhail died on his way there and one of his accompanying clergymen, Archmandrite Pimen, reached Constantinople (Slavonic: Tzargrad) before Dionysius and was named Metropolitan of Moscow and All Rus' in place of Mikhail. In 1382 the Dionysius received the title of archbishop from the Patriarch, who was impressed with his piety and humility. In 1383, Dionysius returned from this long journey to his congregation at Suzdal and continued his struggle against the Strigolniki. He also implored Dmitri Donskoi against Pimen, whom he viewed as a usurper, since no one in the Russian Church, not even the Great Prince himself, had been consulted before Pimen was appointed Metropolitan. In 1384, Dionysius was sent back to Constantinople to ask for Pimen's deposition and his own appointment as Metropolitan. Patriarch Neilus Kerameus was not sure whether he could trust Dionysius and sent two metropolitans to Moscow, who were supposed to depose Pimen and install the archbishop of Suzdal. On his way back to Moscow, Dionysius stopped in Kiev, where he was detained by the Kievan prince Vladimir Olgerdovich at the insistence of Cyprian, Archbishop of Kiev, who was to have succeeded as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1378 upon the death of Alexius, but who was not finally welcomed into Moscow until 1390. Dionysius died in detention on October 15, 1385. He was buried in the Caves of St. Anthony at Kiev, in the monastery in which he began his spiritual life. The Russian Orthodox Church used to celebrate his feast day on July 19, but subsequently this tradition died down. He is now commemorated on October 15 of the traditional Julian Calendar (October 28 on the modern Gregorian Calendar), where he is listed as \"Metropolitan of Suzdal\", since he was never able to take possession of his Metropolitan See."

At an early age he wrote a book on the Origin of Acadians, a history that contradicted myths of the time. He also wrote multiple articles and a glossary of the Acadian French language. After finishing school at the College Saint-Joseph in Memramcook during 1872, Poirier was appointed Postmaster of the Dominion Parliament at age 20.  He held that position until he was appointed to the Senate thirteen years later. Poirier was the first Acadian appointed to the Senate of Canada. He was appointed in 1885 and served for 48 years, 6 months, and 17\u00a0days until his death in 1933. As the Constitution of Canada requires new senators to be at least 30 years old and (since 1965) to leave the Senate when they reach 75, Poirier's record can never be exceeded unless the constitution is amended again to allow it. The Pascal Poirier House (built c. 1820\u201330) was designated a Provincial Historic Site under the Historic Sites Protection Act.  The home he was born in has been preserved as a museum and as an important and rare example of early-19th-century Acadian residential construction.  The -storey gabled house, which features a hand-hewn structure, is believed to be the oldest building in Shediac. He was honored as a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by France in 1902."

He worked mainly for Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann, and was the first Irish celebrity to die from an AIDS-related illness. He has been described as \"Ireland's first gay celebrity\". Hanley began presenting pop music shows on RT\u00c9 Radio Cork in 1976. He also did stints in Dublin on RT\u00c9 Radio 1 and RT\u00c9 television, including a special on Gilbert O'Sullivan. When the first dedicated pop station, RT\u00c9 Radio Two (now branded 2FM), was started in 1979, he was one of its best-known DJs. While in Dublin he shared accommodation with Charles Self. In 1981, he moved to London to work for Capital Radio. In 1984, he declined a lucrative offer to remain there and moved to New York City. Hanley founded Green Apple Productions in 1983 with Conor McAnally, an RT\u00c9 television producer and son of actor Ray McAnally. The company produced MT-USA (Music Television USA), a three-hour-long music video show modelled on the new American cable channel, MTV. MT-USA was broadcast on RT\u00c9 from 1984\u201387 on Sunday afternoons. Each block of videos was followed by a segment filmed in New York City with Hanley introducing the videos, discussing American music and culture, and interviewing a celebrity. RT\u00c9 described him as Europe's first VJ (video jockey). In 1987, Hanley died shortly after his 33rd birthday. He had been visibly ill for some time, and was rumoured to have an AIDS-related illness, which he denied. This reflected the stigma then associated with the disease and with homosexuality in Ireland, which was not decriminalised until 1993. The illness admitted by Hanley was congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis, described as an \"eye disorder\"; he was blind in one eye by his death. Toxoplasmosis is very rarely fatal in adults who do not have a weakened immune system. In 2000, Hanley's friend and colleague Bill Hughes, who had himself come out in the 1990s, agreed that Hanley had in fact died of an AIDS-related illness. The same year, the Sunday Tribune newspaper placed Hanley at the top of a list of Irish gay icons. In February 2022, RTE aired a new documentary about Hanley, titled Vincent Hanley: Sex, Lies and Videotapes. It revealed that Hanley was not only a user of cocaine himself, but had introduced others to the drug too."

He was born into a family of musicians and studied cello with Giovanni Perriera and composition with his father, Eliodoro Sollima, at the Conservatorio di Palermo, where he graduated with highest honors. He later studied with Antonio Janigro and Milko Kelemen at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart and at the Universit\u00e4t Mozarteum Salzburg. As a composer, Sollima's influences are wide ranging, taking in jazz and rock, as well as various ethnic traditions from the Mediterranean area. Sollima's music is influenced by minimalism, with his compositions often featuring modal melodies and repetitive structures. Because his works are characterized by a more diverse and eclectic approach to material than the early American minimalist composers, the American critic Kyle Gann has called Sollima a postminimalist composer. Sollima has collaborated with the American poet and musician Patti Smith, appearing on her records and performing with her in concert. He also collaborates with the Silk Road Project."

Trained at the \u00c9cole des Chartes and the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes, he made his first appearance in the world of scholarship as the author of an excellent book called \u00c9tudes sur l'industrie et la classe industrielle \u00e0 Paris au XIIIe et au XIVe si\u00e8cle (1877). This work, composed almost entirely from documents, many unpublished, opened a new field for historical study. Twenty years later he supplemented this book by an interesting collection of Documents relatifs \u00e0 l'histoire de l'industrie et du commerce en France (2 vols., 1898-1900), and in 1897 he published L'\u00e9conomie sociale de la France sous Henri IV, a volume containing the results of very minute research. He did not, however, confine himself to economic history. His Le P\u00e8re Joseph et Richelieu (1894), though somewhat frigid and severe, is based on a mass of unpublished information, and shows remarkable psychologic grasp. In 1878 his Journal parisien de Jean de Maupoint, prieur de Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Couture was published in vol. iv. of the M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Histoire de Paris et de l'\u00cele de France.

He was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, and then Yale College in 1847, and taught at Rocky Mount, North Carolina for a year before resuming study at Yale Divinity School from 1848 to 1851. He was librarian for the Yale Debating Society, Brothers in Unity from 1846 to 1847 and was assistant in the Yale College library from 1851 to 1856. He was followed in that position by William Frederick Poole, who developed Edmands's Subjects for Debates with Reference to Authorities into Poole's Index to Periodical Literature. In 1856 Edmands became chief librarian of the Mercantile Library, Philadelphia. He was one of the original members of the American Library Association, and one of its first vice presidents. He also served as head of the Association of Pennsylvania Librarians for several years."

He began his career making television programs for RTHK, then became a film director in 1980. One of his most critically acclaimed works was Homecoming (1984). This film was different from other films of that period in that it presents certain emotions and sympathies towards the relationship between Mainland China and Hong Kong (the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed the same year Homecoming was released). The film brings together two very well known actresses, Josephine Koo and Siqin Gaowa. Anita Mui's theme song with the same title as the film has also been a popular cantopop song. Ho's son Linq Yim (Chinese:\u4e25\u827a\u4e4b, otherwise known as \u56b4\u7f9a) is an actor, musician, and director who acted in Ho's 2005 film A West Lake Moment, and  composed its original soundtrack."

Hallikainen has played with the Jokerit junior team, and has represented Team Finland in international play. When netminder Pasi H\u00e4kkinen left for Denmark after the 2004\u20132005 season, Hallikainen became the Jokerit #2 goalie in the SM-liiga. With Tim Thomas surprisingly abandoning the team just one day before the regular season opened, Hallikainen had to take on his job with only a day's warning in the first game of the season, a local game versus HIFK, with 10,000 fans in attendance. Hallikainen played an excellent game, which Jokerit won in a shootout after overtime. When netminder Karl Goehring was hurriedly hired to replace Thomas, Hallikainen returned to backup goaltender, and with the arrival of Mikko R\u00e4m\u00f6, to games with the Jokerit junior team. In season 2006/07 Jokerit signed goaltender Juuso Riksman as its number 1, with Hallikainen fighting out the back up spot with youngster Niko Hovinen. When Riksman was sidelined with a long-term back injury, Jokerit quickly replaced him with Andy Chiodo, only for him to pick up an injury almost immediately. Jokerit then signed Finnish netminder Ari Ahonen for the number one spot, with Hallikainen backing him up. When Ahonen was in turn injured, Hallikainen made his season debut in Oulu against K\u00e4rp\u00e4t, then leading the league, making 44 saves and allowing only one goal. He followed this up the next day by posting his first career shutout against Ilves. Hallikainen represented Finland at the 2007 Winter Universiade in Turin, where Finland lost the bronze medal game to come in fourth."

Stasov became a prominent figure in mid-19th-century Russian culture. He discovered a large number of its greatest talents, inspired many of their works and fought their battles in numerous articles and letters to the press. As such, he carried on a lifelong debate with Russian novelist and playwright Ivan Turgenev, who considered Stasov \"our great all-Russian critic.\" He wanted Russian art to liberate itself from what he saw as Europe's hold.  By copying the west, he felt, Russian artists could be, at best, second-rate.  However, by borrowing from their own native traditions, they might create a truly national art that could match Europe's with its high artistic standards and originality. By \"national\" Stasov meant an art that would not only portray people's lives but also be meaningful to them and show them how to live."

By 1818 he was publishing horticultural and botanical works. He published a number of beautifully illustrated works on plants cultivated in British gardens and hothouses. The fine plates were mainly drawn by Edwin Dalton Smith (1800\u20131883), a botanical artist, who was attached to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.  His works include Hortus Suburbanus Londinensis (1818), Geraniaceae (five volumes) (1820\u201330), Cistineae, Sweet's Hortus Britannicus (1826\u201327), Flora Australasica (1827\u201328) and British Botany (with H.

Since the 1960s, when he met Cornelius Cardew and helped found the Scratch Orchestra, Parsons has been strongly associated with the English school of experimental music. He was born in Bolton and studied at St John's College, Oxford before taking up composition lessons under Peter Racine Fricker at the Royal College of Music in London in 1961. In the 1960s he met Cornelius Cardew; Parsons attended Cardew's experimental music classes at Morley College since 1968. In 1969 Cardew, Parsons and fellow composer Howard Skempton founded the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental free ensemble devoted to performing contemporary music. The Orchestra broke up in early 1970s, partly as a result of the politization led by Cardew. Parsons was among the Orchestra members who refused to be associated with the Maoist politics Cardew was propagating, and left. In 1970 Parsons started working as visiting lecturer in the Fine Art department of the Portsmouth Polytechnic and in the Slade School of Art, University College London. In 1974 he and Skempton formed a duo to perform their own works. In 1996\u201397 Parsons was a bi-fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge. During this time he organised concerts at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge. Since the early 1960s Parsons has also been active as a writer on music; his writings include a number of important articles on contemporary English composers. Parsons' music is influenced by Anton Webern, composers of the so-called New York school (John Cage, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff), various English composers he met through Cardew and the Scratch Orchestra, and, since the Portsmouth years, \"Systems\" artists such as Malcolm Hughes and Jeffrey Steele."

The Los Angeles Dodgers then signed him that November, but kept him off their 40-man roster, and the Cincinnati Reds subsequently claimed Prokopec from Los Angeles in the Rule 5 Draft in December. However, Prokopec would never throw another pitch (in either the majors or the minors) for any organization\u2014further labral problems occurred, forcing Prokopec's early retirement from professional baseball at the age of 24.

He was an officer of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia (Jakarta) as well as a talented naturalist.  Born into an influential Dutch family, his father was Jacob Cornelis Radermacher (1700-1748), who was treasurer-general to the prince.  His uncle and his nephew were members of the Board of Directors of the VOC.  In 1757, then only sixteen years old, he had traveled to Indonesian to work as a merchant for the VOC. On 21 May 1761 Jacob married Margaretha Sophia Verijssel.  In 1762 Radermacher created a Freemasonic circle in Batavia becoming the first Freemasonic lodge in Asia.  In 1763 he returned to Holland to continue his studies, and graduated in law at Harderwijk. After graduation on 13 June 1766 he established himself as a lawyer in Arnhem.  After a short time, Radermacher made the decision to return to Batavia. On 20 December 1766 with his wife Margaretha and two sons Frans Reinier and Johannes Cornelis, they boarded the ship Tulpenburg bound for Indonesia. His youngest son, Johannes Cornelis, still an infant, died within one month of their departure. By 1776, Radermacher was promoted by the VOC to title of \"Extra-Ordinair Council of India\". During his years in Batavia, Radermacher was a staunch promoter of the arts and sciences in the Far East.  On 24 April 1778 he founded the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (\"Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en etenschappen\"). He also donated a substantial amount of writings and collections to start the museum.  During this time he also catalogued a significant amount of flora and fauna of the islands of Java and Sumatra.  The trees of the genus \"Radermachera\" are named for him. By 1781 Radermacher was named Commissioner Concerning the Fleet and the Army, and Common Council of India.  After the death of his first wife, he married Bataviase Anna Bosch.  For health reasons in 1783, he requested permission to return to Holland.  However, while en route home in the Indian Ocean on 24 December, there was a mutiny on board the ship and Radermacher was murdered."

Born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, Eaton attended Princeton University, where he graduated in 1957.  He later lived in Rome (1957\u201368), returning to Princeton to earn a PhD in 1970.  He subsequently held faculty appointments at Indiana University (1970\u201392) and the University of Chicago (1989\u201399). Eaton was a prominent composer of microtonal music, and worked with Paul Ketoff and Robert Moog during the 1960s in developing several types of synthesizer.  Notably, he was involved in the development, use, and ultimately unsuccessful commercialization of the SynKet.  He devised a compositional genre called pocket opera, operas scored for a small cast of vocalists and a chamber group, and composed such pocket opera works as Peer Gynt, Let's Get This Show on the Road, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. His operas include The Cry of Clytaemnestra (1980), a re-telling of some of the events surrounding the Trojan War from the perspective of Agamemnon's wife Clytaemnestra, which has been hailed as the first feminist opera. It was premi\u00e8red in Bloomington, at the Indiana University Opera Theater, on March 1, 1980, and received a number of subsequent productions, most notably in New York and California.  Eaton's opera, The Tempest, with a libretto by Andrew Porter after William Shakespeare, was premi\u00e8red at the Santa Fe Opera on July 27, 1985, and subsequently performed in the autumn of 1986 at the Indiana University School of Music. During his tenure at the University of Chicago, Eaton concentrated on works for smaller ensembles, including chamber operas that involved dramatic participation of the instrumentalists alongside the singers.  He founded and directed The Pocket Opera Players, a professional troupe dedicated to the performance of his works in this genre, and occasionally those of fellow composers interested in the form. He continued to lead the Pocket Opera Players in New York City, after his retirement from Chicago in 2001.  He was a recipient of the Prix de Rome, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a MacArthur Fellowship. Eaton died on December 2, 2015, following a brain hemorrhage. His wife Nelda Nelson-Eaton and two children, Estela and Julian, survive him."

        "content": "Oscar Rudolph Neumann (3 September 1867 in Berlin \u2013 17 May 1946 in Chicago) was a German ornithologist and naturalist who explored and collected specimens in Africa. He fled via Cuba and settled in the United States to escape Nazi persecution of Jews. Neumann's starling (Onychognathus neumanni) and several other species are named after him. Neumann was born in wealthy Jewish family, the son of Maximilian and Anna n\u00e9e Meyer. A younger sister of his was Elsa Neumann (1872-1902) who became one of the first physics doctorates from Berlin University. Another sister Alice was a sculptor. He travelled to German East Africa across Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya in 1892 and collected for the Berlin Museum publishing descriptions. In 1899 he accompanied Baron Carlo von Erlanger through Somaliland and southern Ethiopia, collecting birds that went to Lord Walter Rothschild's bird collection in Tring. In 1915 he went to New Guinea and also made an expedition to Sulawesi in 1938 sponsored by the specimen collector and dealer J. J. Menden. In 1908 he lost much of his money and was hoping to work for Rothschild in Tring but this did not materialize as Rothschild himself ran into financial problems. Neumann then took to stock-broking in Berlin. In 1941, with the help of his friend Julius Riemer he fled Nazi Germany, traveling from Berlin to Cuba, then to Chicago, where he worked the final years of his life as a curator in the Field Museum of Natural History. He was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union in 1897 but resigned in 1910 due to financial reasons. He never married. Parts of his collections are now in the Julius Riemer Museum in Wittenberg."

In 1978\u20131980 he took part to the foundation of Liga Veneta and in 1980 he was elected first national secretary of the party. During the party's first official meeting in Recoaro on 9 December 1979, Tramarin gave a famous speech titled Venetian Autonomy and Europe: \"Today for Venetians the moment has come, after 113 years of Italian unitary colonization, to take their natural and human resources back, to fight against the wild exploitation that has brought emigration, pollution and rooting out from their culture\". In 1983 he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies and thus became the first deputy of his party's history. Soon after the election Franco Rocchetta, who had been behind the scenes up to that moment and was disappointed by his missed election, hinted that Tramarin should step down from the post of party leader. After a power struggle, Rocchetta won the battle for the party's leadership and Tramarin was replaced as national secretary by Marilena Marin, future wife of Rocchetta. Subsequently, Tramarin, while continuing to represent Liga Veneta in the Italian Parliament, was ousted from the party and formed Liga Veneta Serenissima, which proved to be a very unsuccessful political party, gaining only 0.2% of the vote in the 1985 regional election. Tramarin never joined Lega Nord but had been active in Liga Veneta Repubblica, a minor Venetist party led by Fabrizio Comencini."

After the subsequent defeats at the Battle of Brihuega and the Battle of Villaviciosa (1710), he had to pull back to Catalonia, where he was made viceroy when Archduke Charles returned to Austria.

He was born in 1873, the son of Joseph and Charlotte Mears. In 1896, Mears and his brother Joseph purchased the Stamford Bridge Athletics Ground and later the nearby market garden with the intention of turning it into the country's finest football ground and staging high-profile matches there. He failed to persuade Fulham FC chairman Henry Norris to re-locate his club to the ground, and considered selling the land to the Great Western Railway Company, who wished to use it as a coal yard. Mears was ultimately persuaded not to sell up, and instead decided to found his own team, Chelsea, in March, 1905. The story goes that he was on the verge of giving up on the football project when his Scotch Terrier bit his colleague Fred Parker, who still supported the idea. So impressed was Mears with his friend's reaction, he decided to take his advice. Mears was on the club's first board of directors, but did not live to see the club achieve any success. His dream of making Stamford Bridge one of England's top stadiums was realised, however, as it staged the FA Cup Final from 1920-22. His descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when his great-nephew Brian sold it to Ken Bates."

He finished his rugby career at Bath Rugby where a debilitating toe injury limited his appearances and finally ended his playing career. Geoghegan is perhaps best known for his try in the 1994 Five Nations match against England at Twickenham, that was instrumental in a famous 13\u201312 win. Another key contribution during the match was a  kick, chase and tackle on England fly-half Rob Andrew which led to a crucial kickable penalty to Ireland. An adept side stepper, he was once described by the commentator Bill McLaren as being \"Like a mad trout up a burn\". Geoghegan was controversially left out of the 1993 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand when England's Ian Hunter and Tony Underwood were taken ahead of him.  Former New Zealand hooker and Geoghegan's then London Irish coach Hika Reid was quoted at the time as being surprised as he felt the conditions would have suited him.  In 1997 the Lions management apparently held a place open for him until the last possible minute, even though he had played little rugby that year due to the toe problems that cut short his career. As an amateur player Geoghegan had a career outside rugby as a solicitor.  He is currently a real estate and finance partner in London at  Rosling King LLP Geoghegan qualified for Ireland through his Galway born father.

Francis junior was educated at the Roman Catholic College at Ware, Hertfordshire, and was trained in medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He set up a private anatomy class in Charterhouse Square, but, in the words of the British Medical Journal, his \"great success as a teacher caused much jealousy, and, in 1825, gave rise to the Council of the College of Surgeons passing a resolution refusing to receive certificates from any but recognised teachers.\" Kiernan's class size dwindled as students departed. Appeals to the Council to rescind its decision, on the grounds of Kiernan's ability and skill as a teacher, were dismissed. He became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1825. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1834 and was awarded its Copley Medal in 1836 for his work on the anatomy of the liver. That same year, he became a founding Member of the Senate of the University of London, where he acted as examiner and lecturer in anatomy and physiology. In 1843, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and served on its Council from 1850. After a single year as Vice-President (1864\u20135), he declined re-nomination on the grounds of ill-health, having suffered a paralytic stroke in 1865 from which he never fully recovered. In 1849, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He died unmarried at his home in Manchester Street, Manchester Square, London on New Year's Eve, 1874, and was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Mortlake, London."

His style is described ample and accurate, paying attention to tones and sounds, to contrasts and to orchestral material full of expression. Shams has said about Persian music: \"To me, music has to bring love, harmony, pleasure, happiness, but also rhythm and movement. Our music is so-called sad. It is not. When talking about classical music, I mean it has to keep its nature, but also evolve with time\"."

He also played one season in Japan for the Yokohama Taiyo Whales in 1992. Sheets attended Eastern Mennonite University, where he played basketball. He was named to the Old Dominion Athletic Conference's all-conference second team in 1980 and to the first team in 1982. He graduated from Eastern Mennonite in 1984. He was named to Eastern Mennonite's athletic hall of fame in 1988. Sheets was selected as the first of the Orioles' four picks in the second round (29th overall) of the 1978 MLB draft, nineteen slots ahead of Cal Ripken Jr. His lack of enthusiasm and commitment to the sport while in the minors frustrated Orioles scouts and officials and was chronicled in an article written by Alexander Wolff in the June 15, 1981 issue of Sports Illustrated. In a 13\u201311 loss to the Texas Rangers at Memorial Stadium on August 6, 1986 which was the first-ever game in MLB history that featured three grand slams, Sheets and Jim Dwyer each hit one in the fourth inning off Bobby Witt and Jeff Russell respectively. Toby Harrah had hit the first one of the contest off Ken Dixon two innings earlier in the second. After six seasons in Baltimore, Sheets was dealt to the Tigers for Mike Brumley on January 10, 1990 in a transaction where the Orioles sacrificed a much-needed power hitter for a younger, less expensive player. His 1989 Donruss Baseball Card said he was 6'3\", weighed 235 pounds, and lived in Cockeysville, Maryland, at the time. Sheets had career highs in batting average (.316), home runs (31) and RBIs (94) in 1987. Sheets operates a youth sports facility in Westminster, Maryland, and serves as Gilman School's head Varsity Baseball coach.

While she primarily writes in Spanish, she is fluent in English, German, and French, having worked as a translator for several years. She has traveled extensively and lived in various Central American countries and Europe. The pluralities of these cultural and geographical fusions manifest themselves in her literary production and intellectual thought. Her novel, A-B-Sudario (Alfaguara, 2003), was awarded the Mario Monteforte Toledo Central American Prize for Fiction (Premio Centroamericano de Novela Mario Monteforte Toledo). She has also received residencies by La Maison des \u00c9crivains \u00c9trangers et des Traducteurs in Saint-Nazaire, France and Heinrich B\u00f6ll Haus in Langenbroich, Germany. Although a prolific author with many publications, the majority of Escudos's work remains unpublished. Despite the often limited means of literary circulation in Central America, some of Escudos's unpublished work has nonetheless been recognized. In 2002, for instance, Escudos won a national contest in El Salvador, the Tenth Annual Literary Contest of Ahuachap\u00e1n (D\u00e9cimos Juegos Florales de Ahuachap\u00e1n) for her book, Cr\u00f3nicas para sentimentales. Escudos's narrative voice engages with experimental forms and techniques. This experimentation is intentional, one that structures and situates her work through the opening of possibilities in relationship to selfhood and space. This narrative voice and its relationship to other literary maps is demonstrated in Escudos's current participation in the blogosphere. Her official blog, Jacintario, is a regularly updated medium\u2013\u2013an extension of Escudos's writing that operates as a daily form of expression where the author's voice, and content, varies. As an online cultural magazine, Jacintario contributes to the blogosphere not simply because it is a production by an eminent literary figure, but because of the immediacy and access the blog offers in relationship to a genre in the making."

He was born in 1756 in Seoul. His father was Soam Yi Dong-uk (\u8607\u5dd6 \u674e\u6771\u90c1, 1739-?) from the Pyeongchang clan.  who rose to the rank of champan (vice-minister) and, after possible initial interest, fiercely opposed the spread of Catholic teachings. His mother was a sister of Yi Ga-hwan (\u674e\u5bb6\u7165, 1742-1801), one of the Catholics executed with him in 1801. Yi Seung-hun first came into contact with Catholicism via Yi Byeok in 1779. In 1783-4, he accompanied his father on a diplomatic mission to Beijing, China, and on the suggestion of Yi Byeok contacted the Catholic priests there. He was baptised in Beijing in the spring of 1784. This was the first time that a member of the Korean yangban class was formally baptised as a Christian and he returned to Korea with books, crucifixes, and other Catholic artifacts. Yi Byeok then seems to have taken some time to study the books before declaring himself convinced. He then set about evangelizing those around him, including Gwon Cheol-sin and his younger brother Gwon Il-sin. This was also the moment when he spoke of the Catholic faith to the brothers Jeong Yak-jong, Jeong Yak-jeon, and Jeong Yak-Yong (who recorded the event in his epitaph myojimyeong. It was only after Yi Byeok felt fully convinced that he authorized Yi Seung-hun to baptise himself and the other converts to Catholicism. Early in 1785 the growing group of believers and sympathizers in Seoul moved their regular gatherings for worship from the house of Yi Byeok to that belonging to another convert, Kim Beom-u, on the hill where Myeongdong Cathedral now stands. Almost immediately the authorities raided the house, suspecting it of being a gambling den, and were embarrassed on finding it full of nobles. Yi Seung-hun was among those named in the official report of the incident. After the death of Yi Byeok later that year, Yi Seung-hun took over his role in the group. In the spring of 1786, as there were yet no formally ordained priests in Korea, Various leading Korean laymen, including Choi Chang-Hyon, Yi Tan-won, began acting as \"temporary clerics\". In 1789, however, the Korean Catholics were informed by the bishop in Beijing, Mgr. Gouvea, that such practices were contrary to Church teachings and that they should cease. There would be no ordained priest in Korea until 1795, when the Chinese priest Zhu Wenmiao arrived, at which time the Church had grown to over 4000 members. Yi Seung-hun and Jeong Yak-jong were the main leaders of the community in Seoul after the death of Yi Byeok in 1786. Yi Seung-hun's wife was Jeong Yak-jong's sister. In 1801, the Korean Catholic Church was subject to the first major repression by the government (the Sinyu Persecution) in which more than 300 people were killed. Yi was martyred by beheading on the 26th of the 2nd lunar month (April 8), 1801. This incident has come to be known as the Catholic Persecution of 1801. Little written material remains from this period but a collection of texts by several of the first believers, known as Mancheon yugo (\u8513\u5ddd\u907a\u7a3f), was discovered in about 1970. Mancheon was the ho of Yi Seung-hun, whose writings occupy a major part of the book, together with texts written by Yi Byeok etc. It is not known when or by whom the collection was made, and although it is sometimes claimed to be in the handwriting of Jeong Yak-yong, this does not seem to be the case."

Ferguson made his debut as a fifteen-year-old lower-middle order batsman, though he averaged merely five with the bat throughout the tournament, as Argentina finished third in their Plate Group. Seven years later, Ferguson showed up for the 2001 ICC Trophy tournament, where he played two matches for the team. He played in Division Two of the 2006 World Cricket League Americas Region in February. Ferguson became the Division Two Wicket-keeper of the tournament, following his figures of five catches and one stumping in four matches which made him the most successful Argentine fielder of the tournament. He appeared in Division One of the same competition in August 2006, though he could not stop Argentina finishing winless and bottom of the table. Ferguson is an upper-middle order batsman and the first-choice wicket-keeper for the team. His grandfather, George Ferguson, also played for Argentina and was a member of the South American cricket team that toured England in 1932, playing six first-class matches.

He was born in Santiago, Chile, the son of the Basque Domingo Eyzaguirre Escutasolo and of Mar\u00eda Rosa de Arechavala y Alday.  He studied in the seminary of his native City, and showed remarkable aptitude for mathematics and chemistry. When scarcely nineteen years old he was appointed as assayer of the royal mint of Santiago, but resigned the next year, and devoted himself entirely to the cultivation of a farm near Santiago, inherited from his father. There his labors tended more to the improvement of the condition of the laboring classes than to his own pecuniary interest. He improved the yield of some of the poorest lands by his knowledge of chemistry, introduced modern agricultural implements, and, by giving his laborers better than the accustomed wages and caring for their moral and material welfare, soon assembled a colony of well to do and contented people. He also introduced looms, which, although imperfect, served to weave from native wool the coarse cloth worn by the peasantry. From the first years of his country life he agitated the project of a canal to water the barren plain surrounding Santiago, which had been begun some time before, but was abandoned. The Spanish government approved the plan, and in 1802 made Eyzaguirre director. He pushed the work with energy until it was interrupted by the revolution of 1810, and notwithstanding he sympathized with the patriotic cause, he abstained from any participation. His prestige as an honorable and impartial man was so great that, even when his brothers were exiled, he suffered no persecution from the Spanish authorities, and was enabled to alleviate the sufferings of his compatriots. When the independence of Chile was finally established in 1817, he resumed his favorite work, and in 1820, amid great festivities, the canal of Maipo was opened. This, with many smaller lateral canals, soon converted the arid plain into a fertile garden. It was placed by the government under the administration of a board, of which Eyzaguirre was appointed president. In 1823 he was commissioned to reorganize the charitable institutions, and undertook the task of building a home for wayfarers and needy persons. Within a few years he had collected the necessary means, and a new and commodious building was erected. In 1835 he was appointed first governor of the department of Victoria, the capital of which he had founded and spent a good part of his fortune in improving. He established the agricultural society in 1838, and was elected its president. He was several times deputy to the National congress, where he soon became noted for his honesty. In 1845 he attempted to establish a socialistic colony in the country, where all should share the labor and produce, but soon dissensions broke out, and the project failed. A few years later he undertook to establish a large cloth factory, with the object of improving the condition of the poor and giving occupation to women and children. In this enterprise he invested the greater part of his fortune, but before the factory was finished he died. The Maipo canal board erected a statue to his memory."

        "content": "Vladimir Sergeyevich Shilykovsky () (3 April 1933 \u2013 7 April 1987) was a Soviet/Russian speed skater. Shilykovsky competed internationally from 1956 to 1960, and took part in two Winter Olympics, both times in the 10,000\u00a0m. His best season was 1958, when he won the overall silver medal in both the European Championships at Eskilstuna and in the World Championships at Helsinki, on both occasions trailing just behind Oleg Goncharenko. It is widely acknowledged that Shilykovsky had to skate the final 10,000\u00a0m distance in much less favourable conditions than Goncharenko, and Shilykovsky was seen as the \"moral world champion\" by the spectators and commentators. At the start of the Olympic 1960 season, the world record on the 10,000\u00a0m was still the legendary 16:32.6 set in 1952 by Hjalmar Andersen (although Nikolay Shtelbaums had skated 16:31.4 in Chelyabinsk on 4 February 1959, a result not ratified by the International Skating Union (ISU)). On 31 January 1960 at Medeo, both Shtelbaums (16:18.9) and Shilykovsky (16:13.1) skated below Andersen's record time, at the traditional \"Prize of the Soviet Ministry of the Kazakh Republic\" competition; but again these world record times were not officially ratified by the ISU. At the 1960 Winter Olympics four weeks later, first Kjell B\u00e4ckman (16:14.2) and then Knut Johannesen (15:46.6) lowered the official world record, while Shilykovsky only managed a 20th place, skating in unfavourable conditions. Shilykovsky's personal bests were 42.8 (500\u00a0m), 2:15.1 (1,500\u00a0m), 8:06.7 (5,000\u00a0m), in addition to the 16:13.1 (10,000\u00a0m). Shilykovsky grew up in Vladimir but moved to Moskva for education and for sports. He became Moskva champion in 1955 and finished his master of sports degree the same year. He skated for Shakhter and later on for Spartak. He held a degree in technical sciences (\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a) from 1969, and published scholarly articles in his field. Shilykovsky was a highly unusual athlete by being able to compete at world top level in spite of a severe handicap; he lost his right arm when he was six months old as the result of an illness. This did not stop him taking part in all normal activities. In addition to his speed skating achievements, he was an accomplished swimmer and cyclist."

He is the Interim Executive Director of the Cultural Space Agency, having most recently served for 9 years as the Cultural Space Liaison for the City of Seattle. He is also well known as the founder of Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle. Richter has been producing alternative contemporary art, performance, film and music since his graduation from Northwestern University in 1990. In 1992, he formed the seminal Rm 608, a gallery for visual and performing arts, in an abandoned storefront on Seattle's Capitol Hill. The \"small but influential\" (The Stranger) organization served as the launching point for local talents such as David Schmader, the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, Kia Sian, and Kristen Kosmas, and over the course of its two-year lifespan presented over 200 world-premiere works of theater and performance art, several of which received continued runs off-Broadway in New York City. On its closing in 1994 (the organization's lifespan was built into its structure, and the closing was anticipated) Richter was quoted in The Seattle Weekly as saying, \"Organizations should end, in the same way that performances end, so that the audience can clap, go home, and think about what it meant.\" In 1994, he was hired as the Theater Editor of The Stranger, the alternative newsweekly in Seattle. While there, he expanded his interest in writing and published investigative journalism (according to the paper's website, one undercover report earned him personal bodyguard protection following death threats made by the group investigated) and feature-length articles that were reprinted in alternative newsweeklies around the country. He was also published in an American Heritage college geography textbook.  He left the newspaper in 1997 but continues to publish sporadically, most recently writing on the issue of nonprofit reform in America. In 1998, he formed Consolidated Works, a contemporary arts center in Seattle, housed in a renovated  warehouse in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood. Art in America called ConWorks (as it was known for short) \"the most dazzling\" alternative arts space in the Northwest. Over the course of seven years as its executive director, he grew the organization into one of the region's most prestigious arts presenters, working with teams of curators and producers to fill the facility's theater, cinema, visual art gallery, music hall, lecture stage, and bar. The center flourished, reportedly thanks to Richter's \"legendary fundraising skills\" and \"internationally renowned programming\" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). In 2002 he was one of twelve individuals invited under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation to contribute as founding members of the National Arts and Technology Network. In 2003 he received the Seattle Mayor's Arts Award on behalf of ConWorks, and also in 2003 was one of 12 recipients nationally of the Safeco Insurance Rudy Award for leadership in the nonprofit sector. A profile of the Seattle arts scene in Art in America referred to Richter as \"an arts visionary.\" A profile in The Stranger referred to him as \"freakishly ambitious.\""

Kiker was born in Griffin, Georgia. He first gained national attention for his book \"The Southerner,\" published in 1957 and followed by \"Strangers on the Shore\". Later, he became director of information for the Peace Corps, serving from 1961 until 1963.  He left the government and became a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune newspaper and in his first week on the job rode in the press bus in the motorcade of President John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. By 1966, NBC News had taken notice of his varied background and hired him as a correspondent.  He would remain with that network for the rest of his life. Kiker became distinguished for his numerous assignments over the years for NBC. Perhaps his best-known work was covering military conflicts in Southeast Asia (namely Vietnam) and the Mideast (particularly the Iranian Revolution); during much of that time, he served as NBC's Rome bureau chief, with a territory encompassing most of Europe and western Asia. He received the Peabody Award in 1970 for his coverage of the Black September in Jordan conflict. But Kiker also excelled at domestic stories, as well, including the civil rights movement and U.S. politics.  He reported from Walter Reed Army Medical Center on the 1969 death of President Dwight Eisenhower.  He was also the commentator on the August 9, 1974 live broadcast of President Richard Nixon's departure from office in disgrace from the Watergate scandal. Kiker filed reports for David Brinkley's documentaries and short-lived newsmagazines during the 1970s, in addition to his regular work on NBC Nightly News, where he occasionally anchored on the weekends.  Kiker worked as a floor reporter during NBC's coverage of the 1972 political conventions and was Washington editor for Today in the mid- to late 1970s. In the early 1980s, Kiker did a report critical of radio personality Howard Stern, just as Stern was leaving a Washington D.C. station to join WNBC-AM in New York.  The report likely foretold the problems Stern would later have at WNBC. Despite the success of his 1950s novels, Kiker did not return to book length fiction until later in his life, when he wrote three mystery novels, \"Murder on Clam Pond\" (published in 1986), \"Death at the Cut\" (1988), and \"Death Below Deck\" (1991). The mysteries were set on Cape Cod and featured reporter Mac McFarland. They received considerable critical acclaim. According to obituaries in The New York Times and other major newspapers, Douglas Kiker died in his sleep, apparently from a heart attack, while vacationing at his beloved Cape Cod summer home in Chatham, Massachusetts. He was 61. He was survived by his wife, one daughter, and four sons."

        "content": "Benjamin Jenison McCoy (November 9, 1915 \u2013 November 9, 2011) was a second baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Detroit Tigers (1938\u20131939) and Philadelphia Athletics (1940\u20131941). Listed at . 170\u00a0lb., he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was born in Jenison, Michigan. McCoy was 22 years old when he entered the majors in September 1938 with the Detroit Tigers, appearing in seven games while hitting a .200 batting average (3-for-15). In 1939, though he played just two months for Detroit after Charlie Gehringer was injured, McCoy hit .302 with 33 runs batted in and 38 runs scored in 55 games played. At the end of the season, he was dealt by the Tigers to the Philadelphia Athletics in exchange for Wally Moses. McCoy was among 91 Detroit minor league players declared free agents by baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The Tigers had been blocking players in their minor league system for years, players with major league skills, which was a fairly common practice in those days as there were only 16 big league clubs and precious few jobs. For a middle infielder, McCoy was a very good offensive player, but Detroit had Gehringer and he was blocked in the minors. With the deal canceled, McCoy had bids from ten major-league clubs. The Washington Senators offered him a bonus of $20,000, the New York Giants raised it to $25,000, the Brooklyn Dodgers to $35,000, and the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds to $40,000. McCoy, who got $15 for his first major league season and thought his $5,000 in 1939 was big money, accepted the Philadelphia Athletics'offer: a $45,000 bonus, a two-year contract at $10,000 a year, and a regular job at second base under the tutorial guidance of manager Connie Mack. His was not only the biggest bonus in major league history, $20,000 more than the previous top, given Rick Ferrell by the St. Louis Browns in 1929, but it made McCoy the highest-paid bigleaguer of the year. His 1940 income of $55,000 will be more than the salary of Joe Di Maggio, Jimmy Foxx or Hank Greenberg. McCoy played in 1940 and 1941 with the Athletics. His most productive season came in 1941, when he hit .271 with 61 RBI and posted career-highs in games (141), hits (140), walks (95), runs (86), home runs (8), and triples (7). He spent the next four years in the US Navy during World War II. When he returned from service, his skills had eroded and he never played another game. In a four-season career, McCoy was a .269 hitter (327-for-1214) with 16 home runs and 156 RBI in 337 games, including 182 runs, 327 hits, 52 doubles, 18 triples, and eight stolen bases. A selective and patient hitter, he posted a solid .384 on-base percentage and a respectable 1.56 strikeout-to-walk ratio (190-to-122). McCoy played in the  National Baseball Congress with the St Joseph's Autos team in 1946. Before his death, he was recognized as one of the oldest living major league ballplayers. McCoy died on his 96th birthday on November 9, 2011."

In 2003, Aiko was set to release her debut album, My Name Is Jhen\u00e9, through her labels Sony, The Ultimate Group and Epic; however, the album was never released, with Aiko eventually asking to be released from the label in order to continue her education. In March 2011, Aiko made her return to music with the release of her first full-length project, a mixtape titled Sailing Soul(s). On December 16, 2011, Aiko signed a recording contract with American record producer No I.D.'s record label ARTium, under the aegis of Def Jam Recordings. In 2013, Aiko appeared on Big Sean's single \"Beware\", also featuring Lil Wayne, which became her first top 40 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. In November 2013, she released her first project for Artium and Def Jam, an extended play (EP), titled Sail Out. The EP was supported by the singles \"3:16AM\", \"Bed Peace\" and \"The Worst\", the latter of which went on to become certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aiko released her major-label debut album, Souled Out, on September 9, 2014. On September 22, 2017, she released her second studio album Trip. On March 6, 2020, she released her third studio album, Chilombo, which earned Aiko three Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year.

Miyata was born on April 1, 1954, in Tokyo and graduated from the Kunitachi College of Music, where she majored in piano. While in school, she began studying gagaku music from Ono Tadamaro of the Imperial Household Agency. Although the sh\u014d is generally associated with Japan's ancient gagaku court music, Miyata was among the first players of the instrument to specialize in contemporary classical music. She plays a specially constructed instrument with extra pipes, allowing for the use of more chromaticism. The US composer John Cage (1912\u20131992) composed a number of works for Miyata just before his death. Cage met her during the 1990 Darmstadt summer course. She has also premiered works by T\u014dru Takemitsu, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Maki Ishii, Joji Yuasa, Klaus Huber, Toshio Hosokawa, and Uro\u0161 Rojko. In 2005, Miyata performed in three songs by the Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk, for the soundtrack album to Drawing Restraint 9, a film by Bj\u00f6rk's contemporary media artist boyfriend Matthew Barney, about Japanese culture and whaling.

Scott was born in Suva, Fiji, and educated in Fiji and New Zealand. He held a number of prominent public positions for various national, regional and international councils and programmes. He was a fourth generation European Fijian and his father, Sir Maurice Scott was the first European Speaker in the Parliament of Fiji. Scott joined the Red Cross in 1994 and played a key mediation role after George Speight seized parliament on 19 May 2000 and took Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his government hostage for 56 days. Scott was initially the only outsider allowed to see the hostages and eventually oversaw their release. He declined to testify in Speight's trial because he did not want to compromise the neutrality of the Red Cross. Scott was involved in trying to restore Fiji's overthrown 1997 constitution and was among the members of the gay community that put forward submissions to keep the constitution because it protected LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights. John Scott was murdered on 1 July 2001 in Suva along with his partner, Gregory Scrivener, in an apparent homophobic attack with a possible political motive. John's Story became the subject of a New Zealand documentary, An Island Calling. which is based on the book Deep Beyond The Reef, written by his brother Owen Scott."

Morren taught physics at Ghent University between 1831 and 1835. At the same time he studied medicine and graduated in 1835. He became Professor extraordinarius of botany at the University of Li\u00e8ge from 1835 to 1837, and full professor from 1837 to 1854. Morren discovered that the vanilla flower is pollinated by the social and stingless Melipone bee, which occurs only in Mexico, obviating natural pollination in other countries. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s brought vanilla to Europe, but for more than 300\u00a0years the pollination mechanism remained a mystery. Morren was the first to discover a method for artificial pollination, which made it possible to cultivate vanilla in the French colonies. Pollination of vanilla pods is required to make the plants produce the fruit from which the vanilla spice is obtained. In 1837, Charles Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant. The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. In 1841, Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old slave who lived on the French island of R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant. Noted\u00a0French\u00a0botanist\u00a0and plant collector Jean Michel Claude Richard falsely claimed to have discovered the technique three or four years earlier, but by the end of the 20th century, Albius was considered the true discoverer. He was the father of Charles Jacques \u00c9douard Morren. Morren and his son produced the journal La Belgique Horticole (35 volumes, 1851\u20131885). Morren also coined the term phenology, which refers to the scientific discipline that studies the seasonal cycles of animals and plants.  Morren first used the term phenology in 1849 during a public lecture at the Academy of Brussels.  The first use of the term phenology in a scientific paper dates back to 1853 when Morren published \u201cSouvenirs ph\u00e9nologiques de l\u2019hiver 1852-1853\u201d (\u201cPhenological memories of the winter 1852-1853\u201d).  This paper describes an exceptionally warm winter when plants exhibited unusually phenological patterns. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation C.Morren when citing a botanical name."

She was also known as Mrs Reeves after her marriage in 1877 to Dr. Henry Albert Reeves (1841\u20131914) but was best known under her pen name, Helen Mathers. She was born in Misterton, Somerset. Her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" was published in 1875. It was partly based on people in her life and on her own early romantic experiences. She also acknowledged Rhoda Broughton as an early influence. She continued to write until her death. She was educated at a boarding school in  Chantry near Frome in Somerset. In her first novel, \"Comin' thro' the Rye\" she describes some of her experiences at school. \"Mr Russell\" in the novel was the Rev. Mr. Fussell in real life, who was the Lord of the manor and founder of the school. In the novel she calls the village Charteris. From 1875 to 1895 the novel sold over 35,000 copies. Due to a confusion of titles, some sources attribute a number of books by Scottish novelist Anne S. Swan to Mathers. Mathers published a short novel entitled \"Land o' the Leal, by the Author of Comin' Thro' the Rye\" in 1878. Swan published \"The Land o' the Leal\" (same title except with the addition of \"The,\" completely different book) using her male pseudonym David Lyall, in 1896. Conflating the two different novels with the same title has led some people to assume (erroneously) that David Lyall is Mathers's pseudonym. It is not."

After Heaven of Love (2005), featuring the duet, sold 800,000 copies, Gutawa was approached by Sony Music Indonesia with an offer to record a solo album. The success of that album, the self-titled Gita Gutawa, led to numerous acting and marketing job offers.

As an actress, she has starred in two Indonesian soap operas, Ajari Aku Cinta and Ajari Lagi Aku Cinta.

Considered the hardest-working photographer and businessman in 19th-century Brazil, with offices in Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo, Henschel was also responsible for the presence of other professional photographers in the country, including his compatriot Karl Ernst Papf\u2014with whom he later worked. Henschel became known for making pictorial representations of Rio de Janeiro as a landscaper photographer and for being an excellent portraitist. He earned the title of Photographo da Casa Imperial (Photographer of the Royal House), allowing him to photograph the everyday life of the Brazilian monarchy during the Reign of Pedro II, even photographing the emperor Dom Pedro II and his family. This title would give his photographs increased recognition and raise their price. But his principal contribution to the history of Brazilian photography is his photographic record of  the different social classes in Brazil in the 19th century: portraits, usually in the carte de visite format, taken of the nobility, of rich tradesmen, of the middle-class, and of black people, either slaves or free, in a period  before the Lei \u00c1urea."

        "content": "Eustathius or Eustace of Mtskheta (Evstat'i Mtskhet'eli; ) (died  550) is an Orthodox Christian saint, executed for his apostasy from Zoroastrianism by the Sasanian military authorities in Caucasian Iberia (Kartli, eastern Georgia). His story is related in the anonymous 6th-century Georgian hagiographic novel The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta. One of the earliest extant works of the Georgian literature, The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta (\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10e2\u10f3\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10db\u10dd\u10d7\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0\u10f2 \u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d4\u10d5\u10e1\u10e2\u10d0\u10d7\u10d8 \u10db\u10ea\u10ee\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8\u10e1\u10d0\u10f2) was written by an anonymous author later in the 6th century, within thirty years of Eustathius' reported death. The morphology of the work as well as some theological phrases also supports this dating, although the earliest surviving manuscript dates from c. 1000 (Georgian National Center of Manuscripts, MSS H-341). The text is also interesting for the first Georgian formulation of the Ten Commandments, an account of the life of Jesus which recalls Tatian's Diatessaron (a Gospel harmony of the 2nd century), and traces of influence of the 2nd century Apology of Aristides. The Passion was first published by Mikhail Sabinin in 1882. Eustathius is reported by the hagiographer to have been an Iranian cobbler originally called Gvirobandak, son of a high-ranking Zoroastrian priest (magi), from Ganzak. Having converted to Christianity, he flees persecution to Georgia (Iberia), then under the Iranian military authority, in 541. He settles at the Christian town of Mtskheta and marries a Christian woman. The local Iranian cobblers\u2019 guild denounces Eustathius to the marzban Arvand Gushnasp with seven other converts to be judged. Arvand punishes the apostates by having their noses pierced and casts them in prison under sentence of death. Six months later, Arvand releases them, however, as a farewell gesture to the local people, when recalled from Georgia by the king Khosrau I. Four years later, under the new marzban Vezhan Buzmihr, Eustathius is rearrested, but reaffirms his faith before the court in a speech of some 3,000 words that makes up nearly half the Passion. Eventually, the marzban, albeit reluctant, has him beheaded in Tbilisi. The remains of Eustathius were taken to Mtskheta and buried at its principal church."

Stephens attended Washington High School in Los Angeles County, California, and signed with the Detroit Tigers in 1939. The following season he was acquired by the Indians and spent 1940\u20131942 in their farm system, winning 20 of 24 decisions in 1942 for the Class B Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League. He then missed the 1943\u20131945 seasons while serving in the United States Army during World War II. After one more year of minor league seasoning in 1946, Stephens made the 1947 Indians' roster. In his first Major League appearance, as a starting pitcher on May 15 against the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium, Stephens scattered eight hits, all singles, in a complete game, 9\u20131 triumph over eventual Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn. Sent to the bullpen by manager Lou Boudreau, Stephens then went over a month before his next starting assignment \u2014 again at Washington and against Wynn. This time, on June 19, Stephens took the loss, 3\u20132, and left for a pinch hitter after the fifth inning. Altogether, he made five starts for Cleveland was used exclusively as a relief pitcher after July 15. He fashioned a 5\u201310 win\u2013loss mark and a 4.01 earned run average, with one save, in 92 innings pitched for the Indians. Stephens was traded on November 20, 1947, with $25,000, Joe Frazier, and Dick Kokos for Walt Judnich and Bob Muncrief. Stephens worked out of the bullpen early in the 1948 season before making six successive starts during June; however, he lost his first four decisions before throwing another complete game, a 9\u20136 win over the Boston Red Sox at Sportsman's Park, winning the game himself by driving in three runs with an eighth-inning double off Mel Parnell.  (Bryan Stephens was one of three players with a similar surname who played in that game, including Boston's Vern Stephens and the Browns' first baseman, Chuck Stevens.) But Bryan Stephens' year with the Browns had few bright spots: he collected three saves and posted three wins, against six losses, with a poor 6.02 earned run average in  innings pitched.  He spent the next two seasons, his last as a professional, in the minors. All told, Stephens allowed 220 hits and 106 bases on balls in  Major League innings pitched, with 69 strikeouts."

He was the son of Field Marshal Michael Gallitzin and grandson of Prince Boris Kurakin. In the late 1750s, Prince Gallitzin resided in Paris where he headed the Russian embassy during the Seven Years' War. His beautiful wife Catherine died there in 1761. Her liaison with actress La Clairon gained great notoriety. Catherine was the daughter of Dimitrie Cantemir, the former ruler of Moldavia, by Princess Anastasiya Trubetskaya. She was also the sister of Antiochus Cantemir. From 1761 to 1792 he was Russian ambassador to Austria, with the poet Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay as his secretary. Catherine the Great bestowed on him the Order of St. Andrew for negotiating the First Partition of Poland with Emperor Joseph II. The prince was acclaimed for having returned to Russia the lands annexed by his patrilineal ancestor, Grand Duke Gediminas. In the winter of 1782 Mozart was engaged for all the concerts given by Gallitzin who \"placed his carriage at my disposal both going and returning, and treated me in the handsomest manner possible\". Gallitzinberg is the hill near Vienna where the Russian ambassador built his residence (with an artificial Roman ruin and a round temple still standing). Gallitzinstra\u00dfe in Vienna is also named after him. The childless Prince Gallitzin, wishing to keep the memory of his wife alive for future generations, spent a fortune to establish the Golitsyn Hospital in Moscow. His palace in Vienna boasted several hundred paintings by Old Masters. After his death, these paintings were exhibited in the gallery of the Golitsyn Hospital before being auctioned off in order to finance the hospital's extension."

His naval career culminated with a period of squadron command. For nearly a decade he was in charge of a squadron on the Uruguay River, using the schooner Oriental as his flagship. He prepared for the Portuguese invasion of 1816, which resulted in the defeat of the troops led by Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas and the annexation of the Banda Oriental to the Kingdom of Brazil as the Cisplatina province. He was considered a consummate planner, especially in the area of combined operations with land forces. His personality, education, and intelligence led him to be involved in many activities, such as diplomacy. Similar to many Portuguese soldiers active in the Cisplatina province, he married a woman from the region, Eugenia Gadea Paredes from the Soriano Department. During the Cisplatine War, he was named commander of the Third Division, the Brazilian naval squadron in the Uruguay River. He suffered a major defeat against admiral William Brown in the Battle of Juncal, after which he was taken prisoner. After refusing to give an oath of submission, he succeeded in escaping, and in 1829 he was one of those who entered the plaza of Montevideo as a result of the Preliminary Peace Convention. He died extremely poor, at the age of 66."

He was born in Zaragoza in the first third of the fifteenth century and straddles the line between the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. He lived most of his life at the monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Santa Fe, though he also spent some time at San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a. According to F\u00e9lix de Latassa y Ort\u00edn, besides history he wrote various treatises on poetry and a compendium of verse. Vagad's magnum opus, the Cr\u00f3nica de Arag\u00f3n, a vernacular Romance history of Aragon from the mythical Kingdom of Sobrarbe (founded 724) up to the death of Alfonso V (1458), was published in Zaragoza in 1499; its incunabula survive. It was commissioned by the deputies of Ferdinand II of Aragon, who named Vagad cronista mayor (senior chronicler), though the office of cronista was not formally instituted until the Cortes of Monz\u00f3n in 1547. For the work Vagad consulted the archives of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a, San Victori\u00e1n, Poblet, Montearag\u00f3n, and Barcelona among other archives of the Crown of Aragon. In international matters he was a Spanish partisan and this bias enters into his history: he considered the Emperor Maximilian I a Spaniard and made the legendary Count Julian an Italian. In peninsular matters his Aragonese bias is evident, as when he devalues the conquest of Valencia by the Castilian folk hero El Cid (1094) relative to the conquest of the same city by James I of Aragon (1236). The work contains three prologues. In the first Vagad heaps praise on Spain in the tradition of Isidore's Laus Spaniae; in the second he argues from history for the preeminence of Aragon amongst the kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula; and in the third he defends the importance of Zaragoza as the chief city of Spain. Preoccupied with style, his narrative is frequently interrupted by lengthy and banal arguments. Eduard Fueter, the Swiss historian of universal historiography, writes that Vagad's Cr\u00f3nica contains the \"timid critical germs of the medieval tradition\" (t\u00edmidos g\u00e9rmenes de cr\u00edtica de la tradici\u00f3n medieval)."

He is the primary songwriter and lead singer of his band Cafeine and has also released music under alternate spellings; Caf\u00e9ine, Xavier Caf\u00e9\u00efne, or Caf\u00e9\u00efne. Xavier received formal Jazz-Pop bass training at the C\u00e9gep Marie-Victorin school in Montreal. His first release was the indie-punk album Mal \u00e9duqu\u00e9 mon amour in 1998 sung entirely in French. The follow up album Pornstar was released in 2000, leaning toward a more glam rock sound, with English lyrics. Xavier formed a band called Poxy and released their self-titled album in 2004, followed by Artificial Pleasures in 2007. In August 2006, he released Gis\u00e8le on Indica Records as a solo project. Once again Xavier wrote the music, sang and performed most of the instruments on his album. Additional drums were recorded by his friend Michel Langevin of Voivod. Gis\u00e8le considered a classic French-language punk rock album, earning two ADISQ 2007 nominations for \"Best Rock Album of the Year\" and \"Best Male Artist\", and winning the GAMIQ 2007 award for \"Best Rock Album\". The Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada awarded him the \"2008 Discovery of the Year Song\" award for \"La fin du monde\". Cafeine's most recent album New Love was released again on Indica Records in 2013. The album was produced by Gus Van Go, giving the sound a crisper, more modern electro-punk-pop-rock sound. Singles \"New Love\", \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\" each reached the top 15 French-Canadian Commercial Alternative Radio BDS charts. New Love was primarily recorded in English with alternate French language versions for \"Electric\" and \"L'ettre D'Amour\".  On February 17, 2015, New Love was digitally released in the US, marking the first time Cafeine's music received domestic distribution in a territory outside of Canada. The USA album cover art was changed from a photo of Cafeine to a blown out photo of a headless angel. A cover version of The Gun Club's song Sex Beat was included as a bonus track. As a live performer, Cafeine is known for his high-octane-punk intensity. Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec quoted \"he is still a beast on stage\" referencing Toronto's alternative weekly NOW Magazine who declared \"Cafeine is amazing, what a beast on stage\". Established as a beloved personality, Cafeine regularly makes live appearances on French-Canadian music television such as Radio-Canada Television's show Stereopop or MusiquePlus specials such as Pop de jam. In 2007, Belgian singer Plastic Bertrand contacted him to collaborate on the writing and composing of his new album \"Dandy Bandit\". Together they wrote seven songs. The two remain good friends, periodically performing together live as recently as June 24, 2015 in Montreal for the annual St. Jean Baptiste holiday. The free outdoor concert was attended by over 15,000 people in the streets of the Villeray area of Montreal and presented by La fete national dans Villeray 2015. Other producer & songwriting collaborations include two albums for French-Canadian punk band Gazoline, \"Futurbabymama\" (2012) and their self-titled album Gazoline (2014)."

At a young age, Hong learned to sing and play violin. He first performed at Taihoku City Public Auditorium as part of a children's group, and later as a singer of Japanese patriotic songs. Inspired by Haruo Oka, Hong quit his job at a lumber mill to become a singer, writing his first song, Butterfly in Love with a Flower (), aged 19 in 1946 under the stage name Hong Wen-chang (). He led a group of singers that performed frequently near the Danshui River until the February 28 Incident forced Hong to move to Tainan. Hong began singing on the radio in 1948, alongside  and others. His radio performances drove his popularity, and, in 1957, he released his debut album A Handsome Young Man on a Hilltop (), under his best known stage name Ang It-hong, which was suggested by a fortune teller. His first album featured Hokkien lyrics set to Japanese melodies. Most of his works are songs in Hokkien. Ang's music frequently fused enka with jazz. He worked closely with lyricist  on songs such as Memories of an Old Love () and The One Adored (). Ang appeared in the 1962 film Love Never Ceases, which featured the song Memories of an Old Love and several others written by Ang, which appeared on his second album Endless Love, featuring original melodies. Ang spent the late 1960s and 1970s in Japan, as Kuomintang authorities censored Hokkien pop and other media. As restrictions against Hokkien media were lifted in the 1980s, and martial law was suspended, one of Ang's students, Jody Chiang, rose to stardom. Ang also wrote songs for his son Chris. By the time of his death, Ang had over 200 compositions to his name. Ang died from pancreatic cancer on 24 February 2010 at Taipei Medical University Hospital. His funeral was held on 13 March.

        "content": "Princess Wilhelmina of Hesse-Kassel (25 February 1726 \u2013 8 October 1808) was a Prussian princess, married to Prince Henry of Prussia. Wilhelmina was the daughter of Prince Maximilian of Hesse-Kassel and Friederike Charlotte of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the niece of William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and King Frederick I of Sweden. She was introduced to Henry when he visited Kassel in 1751 and was married to him on 25 June 1752. Wilhelmina was described as a charming beauty. Wilhelmina and Henry had their own court and lived at Schloss Rheinsberg and Berlin. Wilhelmina had no children with Henry, who was reported to pay more attention to his male friends than to her. The couple separated in 1766 after an alleged affair on Wilhelmina's side. After the separation, she lived at Palais Unter den Linden in Berlin, where she was served by successive members of the von Blumenthal family (Amalia, Charlotte, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Leopoldine) as ladies-in-waiting. The Swedish princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp described her at the time of her visit in 1798: She was a tall and handsome lady with a well kept figure, though very thin, and you can still see how remarkably beautiful she was in her youth. Her eyes are big and lively though somewhat protruding, and with a restless look. She is witty and literal, but as a consequence of her age, she sometimes talks of several subjects at the same time. Her manners are regal, and she represents perfectly, and was additionally very polite and toward me very pleasant. She was one of the few members of the royal house to remain in Berlin during the French occupation in 1806. While most of the royal family left, reportedly because of the anti-Napoleonic criticisms they had expressed, and the members of the royal court either followed them or left the capital for their country estates, Wilhelmina remained with Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia and his consort Margravine Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt because of \"their high age\" as well as Princess Augusta of Prussia, who was pregnant at the time."

Wagner was born in Linz, and studied in Linz and Munich. In 1947, she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera. Two years later, she was hired by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler to sing in The Magic Flute at the Salzburg Festival. After this successful collaboration, Furtw\u00e4ngler signed her to sing Flo\u00dfhilde and Grimgerde in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at La Scala. This was the beginning of a career that included many of Wagner's alto roles (she and the composer were not related). In 1950, Sieglinde Wagner sang as a contralto, as Orlovsky, a blase young nobleman in Die Fledermaus. In 1952, she made her first appearance at the St\u00e4dtischen Oper in Berlin as Maddalena in Rigoletto. She sang Carmen there in December of the same year. This was the start of a 34-year relationship. Sieglinde Wagner had a very wide repertoire, including Clairon in Richard Strauss's Capriccio, Annina in Der Rosenkavalier, Magdalena in Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg, Fenena in Nabucco, the mother in Hansel and Gretel and Mary in The Flying Dutchman.

Hahn played Minor counties cricket for Oxfordshire from 1964 to 1972 which included 34 Minor Counties Championship matches.  He made his List A debut against Worcestershire in the 1970 Gillette Cup.  In this match he scored 25 runs before being run out.  He played a further List A match against Durham in the 1972 Gillette Cup.  In his second match, he scored 3 runs before being dismissed by Stuart Young. Stan Hahn was also a very fine table tennis player who represented both Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.  He was the leading player in Oxford in 1965, 1967, 1971 to 1974 and again in 1976 and 1977.  Hahn also forged a formidable doubles partnership, and won many titles, with his long-time team-mate, David Harse (\"Harry\"). Hahn had a fine all-round game and could defend away from the table with the best of them.  However, he was probably happiest when deploying his imaginatively varied, unerringly consistent and pitilessly accurate loops to put his opponents on the defensive.  As well as his dominating forehand loop, he was among the first practitioners of the backhand loop, probably the hardest shot in the game.  His matchless powers of concentration meant that, although his style demanded the greatest precision, he seldom missed. Though his competitive drive sometimes spilled over into unnerving displays of fury, he played the game fairly and he encouraged many youngsters, who found him to be an approachable and inspiring champion of the game. He died in Oxford, Oxfordshire on 28 January 1991."

Involved in activism for over 20 years, Abbas has been active in mobilizing worker support during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and its aftermath.  His approach emphasizes peaceful strikes and rallies accompanied by demands for better wages and working conditions, as well as more regular elections for union officials, and an independent union system. He began his work by organizing a strike at a steel plant in Helwan, Egypt in 1989, for which he was arrested, tortured, and fired.  That incident led to his starting the CTUWS and advocating for workers' rights throughout Egypt.  Abbas' relationship with Mubarak's regime was tense and marked by conflicts with the government and multiple arrests. The Los Angeles Times called Abbas \"a major annoyance\" to President Hosni Mubarak's regime, and \"passionate, methodical and accustomed to police surveillance.\" In 2007, Abbas was charged with defamation and sentenced to one year of prison.  There was international condemnation of the ruling, with major labor and human rights groups defending Abbas.  In February 2012 he was once again sentenced to a prison term, this time six months for \"insulting\" a public official. Abbas' work gained momentum and attention during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, where he helped mobilize workers in the nationwide movement for civil rights and the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak's regime."

        "content": "Jyles Jackson Coggins (January 10, 1921 \u2013 August 25, 2011) was an American real estate developer and politician who served in the North Carolina House of Representatives and North Carolina Senate. He served as the Mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina from 1975 until 1977. Coggins was born to a poor family in 1921 in Iredell County, North Carolina, United States. He moved to Chapel Hill in 1939 to pursue a university education, but dropped out due to ill health and took up various jobs. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1942 and fought in World War II as a bomber pilot. Following his discharge in 1946, Coggins moved to Raleigh to resume his education. He shortly thereafter abandoned his studies to start his own construction company. Over time the business grew and completed projects across the southeastern United States, and Coggins became a millionaire. In 1963 he, a conservative Democrat, was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives. Two years later he was elected to the North Carolina Senate. Over the course of his legislative career he advocated for the disabled and opposed liquor, pornography, and coed dormitories on state university campuses. He also frequently disregarded the wishes of state Democratic leaders, earning a reputation as a maverick. Coggins left the Senate in 1971 and unsuccessfully sought a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives the following year. Coggins was elected Mayor of Raleigh in 1975. During his tenure, the Raleigh City Council was split evenly between members aligned with community and environmental activists who wanted to limit the city's growth and others who represented business interests and sought to promote development. The division brought about frequent clashing between Coggins\u2014who had an abrasive, uncompromising style and supported further development in Raleigh\u2014and members of the council. He was challenged in his 1977 reelection bid by Isabella Cannon, who ran at the behest of a coalition of community activists. Coggins frequently attacked the coalition throughout the campaign. Despite having the endorsement of Raleigh's two newspapers and outspending his opponent, he lost the election. He died on August 25, 2011."

        "content": "Karl Sigmund Franz Freiherr vom Stein zum Altenstein (1 October 1770, in Schalkhausen near Ansbach \u2013 14 May 1840, in Berlin) was a Prussian politician and the first Prussian education minister. His most lasting impact was the reform of the Prussian educational system. The Altensteins were descended from a long-established Frankish noble family, whose family seat of Altenstein Castle was located on a ridge between Ebern and Maroldsweisach. Karl was born in 1770 as the son of the count-hussar captain and chamberlin Ernst Freiherr von Stein zum Altenstein of the Ostheim vor der Rh\u00f6n branch of the family, and his mother was Juliana Philippina Wilhelmina Freiin von Adelsheim, Ernsts's second wife. Karl was born in their castle at Oberm\u00f6rgerscheimp. After his education at the gymnasium and corps, he studied law in Erlangen, in 1790 in G\u00f6ttingen, and later in Jena. In 1793, he joined the referendary of the Prussian war and council chamber. His overseer, Karl August von Hardenberg, quickly recognized his talent and encouraged him to join the diplomatic corps. In 1799, he went with Hardenberg to Berlin where he worked for as a Ministerialrat and later became a senior financial officer for the general directorate. As a result of Prussia's losses in the Fourth Coalition War of the Napoleonic Wars at the battle of Jena-Auerstedt, he went with Hardenberg in 1806 to Tilsit to work on the Prussian Reforms. Plans for insurrection against the French occupation stalled the state minister Karl Freiherr vom Stein's reform plans. In 1808, Altenstein became his successor as the head of administration of Finance. He could not prevail against the forces set in motion by his predecessor to introduce reform so he continued them with the same energy. In 1810, Prussia could no longer afford the reparations agreed to in the Peace of Tilsit. Altenstein suggested the cessation of Silesia to France and so was dismissed in June by King Friedrich Wilhelm III at the instigation of Hardenberg. After his release, he went to Breslau where he was appointed civil governor of Silesia in 1813. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, he, together with Wilhelm von Humboldt in Paris, reclaimed treasures that had been confiscated by Napoleon. In 1817, he took over as head of the newly formed Ministry of Culture, again answering to Hardenberg, now State Chancellor. He was charged with the political responsibility of refounding the Evangelical Church in Prussia. In the next 20 years he reformed the Prussian schools, radically changing education. He is credited with the first \"humanistic\" school of education and the University of Bonn in 1818. With the Education Act of 1819, he developed a master plan for the system that still persists today: a multi-unit school system with a differentiation between primary and secondary education. In 1825, he extended compulsory education to the entire country, and in 1834, he introduced a mandatory curriculum for Gymansiums. In subsequent years, he fought for the education system to be independent of the church. He retired in 1838 because of declining health and died in 1840. He is buried in Berlin at the Dreifaltigkeitskirchhof II."

Phinney began his career at the Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston where he designed type and worked in management, eventually becoming owner.  He was a key player in arranging the merger of twenty-six large foundries to form the American Type Founders Company in 1892, becoming both manager of the Boston branch and head of the design department, where he oversaw the consolidation of type faces following the merger.  Though his own designs were largely derivative, Phinney took a great interest in type and its history and throughout his tenure at A.T.F. he sought to preserve and protect that company's legacy, as for instance, when he oversaw the re-introduction of Binny & Ronaldson's 1796 type design, Roman No. 1, as Oxford in 1892, or when he purchased Frederick W. Goudy's first type design, Camelot, in 1896.  He stayed with A.T.F. for the rest of his career, passing the role of design head to Morris Fuller Benton and becoming senior vice-president. Phinney retired shortly before the company fell upon hard times during the Great Depression and died in 1934."

Born Nickolas Konstantin Athanasios Psacharopoulos VII, he claimed to have organized his first theatrical troupe at age 15 under the Nazi occupation of his homeland. He moved to the United States in 1947 and attended Oberlin College where he directed productions for the Oberlin Mummers. He graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history. Three years later he received a Master of Fine Arts Degree in theater direction from the Yale Drama School. In 1955, he joined the faculty of Yale's undergraduate theater studies department and also taught in the graduate Drama School, where he remained until his death from colon cancer at age 60. Psacharopoulos was a co-founder of the Williamstown Theater Festival (WTF) in 1955, based in the Adams Memorial Theater on the campus of Williams College. Psacharopoulos went on to serve as WTF's sole artistic executive director for 33 years, creating a professional summer theater that was more than a typical summer stock escapist operation. He was aided for many years by Tom Brennan, who served as the WTF associate director. Under Psacharopoulos' leadership, WTF specialized in the plays of Anton Chekhov and Bertolt Brecht, as well as the work of many classic American playwrights such as Tennessee Williams, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Archibald MacLeish. Psacharopoulos traveled often between his Greek homeland and New York City, his main residence, where he staged theater productions with the Circle-in-the-Square, the New York Pro Musica, and City Opera. Many directors and leaders of American theater were inspired by Nikos' guidance. Each year he would choose an assistant from his students at Yale or Circle in the Square NYC, to accompany him to WTF to experience their first seasons as professional directors."

The apparitions were determined by the local ordinary, after consultation with the CDF, to be lacking in sufficient evidence of credibility. Pierina was born in the municipality of Montichiari  which is located in the Brescia province of the Lombardy region in northern Italy. She died there  when she was 79 years old. She is mainly known as the seer who claimed the Blessed Virgin Mary revealed herself as Rosa Mystica; the message focussed on Our Lady's motherly care for her deeply beloved consecrated souls of priests and of male and female members of religious institutes within the Roman Catholic Church. On October 15, 1984 the bishop of Brescia issued a statement: \"The Bishop of Brescia supported by the authoritative opinion of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, communicates that (a) the afore-mentioned apparitions of Our Lady the Mystical Rose in Montichiari do not present motives of credibility; (b) the cult relative to Our Lady the Mystical Rose, therefore, is not approved and can not be practiced nor favored; (c) whosoever favors it, by spreading publications or by organizing pilgrimages, does not help, but disturbs the faith of believers by inducing them to behave contrary to the disposition of the Church.\" Subsequent bishops, and the Foundation erected in 2014 to care for the pilgrims, have repeatedly clarified that the alleged apparitions have not been approved, and discouraged the premature promotion of Pierina Gilli's claims, while at the same time making provision for the spiritual care of those who nonetheless go there. This position was most recently reaffirmed in 2013 in the current Directory governing devotions in Fontanelle."

He was a National Party member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1986 to 1989, representing the electorate of Nerang. Hynd was born in Sydney, the son of a coalminer. He attended Chatswood Primary School, Mosman High School and Gore Hill Technical College. He trained as a master builder, and later opened TS Hynd Pty Ltd, a business specialising in electronic doors. He was a prominent business figure on the Gold Coast, and Alex Douglas claimed that \"he installed probably half of the roller doors on houses that were built\". He was actively involved in the National Party, and had been the vice-president of its south-east zone. Hynd was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1986 state election for Nerang, a new electorate created with the enlargement of parliament that year. Hynd was an enthusiastic supporter of Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and endorsed his Joh for Canberra campaign, having been quoted in 1987 as stating: \"It would be the greatest thing ever to happen to Australia if Joh was to be Prime Minister . . . He is just the man to lead this country out of the wilderness. I would walk from here to George Street for Joh to be PM.\" One issue which Hynd took up in parliament with lasting effect was the cause of those living in caravan parks, as he first issued a green paper outlining issues in the area, and then successfully introduced legislation to protect their rights.  He was promoted to Deputy Government Whip in September 1989, two months before the 1989 state election. He was defeated at that election by Liberal candidate Ray Connor, and did not run for office again. In retirement, he was actively involved in the Rotary Club, and made wooden toys and sold them at markets in order to raise money for charity. He died on the Gold Coast on 20 October 2011."

All members of his family were killed during the Holocaust. He finished elementary and high school in Sarajevo. Focht graduated from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, after which he returned to Sarajevo where he was elected assistant at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Sarajevo. Shortly after he moved back to Zagreb where he lived for the rest of his life, until his death. Focht was philosopher of phenomenological orientation, who in the early works departed from the Marxist and psychological interpretations of art. Music is in his texts had ontological priority over all other arts. In the art of music, particularly that of Bach, Focht tried to uncover the importance of achieving pythagorean music. Bach's music, as interpreted by Focht, is not a mere reflection of the subject, nor a reflection of social reality, just as it is not an expression of human feelings, but the secret of life organized and tuned to the cosmic laws. Focht, beside the aesthetics, has published several important books about mushrooms. He was also one of the first thinkers and critics of science fiction in Croatia, considering that our age is the time of death of philosophy, or age of science and science fiction. Focht died in Zagreb on October 20, 1992, and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery."

        "content": "Charles Dashwood Goldie (26 March 1825 \u2013 11 January 1886) was an English clergyman who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University fleetingly in 1846. Goldie was born in Paris, France and baptised on 25 April 1825 in St Marylebone Parish Church, London. He was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge in 1843. Goldie graduated from Cambridge University in 1847 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was priest in charge at High Toynton, Lincolnshire in 1851 and then from 1852 to 1866 he had the same position at St Thomas's Church, Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire. He was vicar of St Ives (then in Huntingdonshire) from 1866 until his death there in 1886. Goldie's tenure at St Ives was controversial and his \"ritualistic proceedings\" alienated many of the congregation; he also attempted to impose church rates and was consistently and successfully opposed on that and on his candidates for the post of churchwarden in \"stormy\" parish meetings that attracted hundreds of people. Goldie's first-class cricket career was accidental. In the 1846 University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford University, held at Oxford, the Cambridge batsman John Walker did not appear for the match; the Cambridge team batted one man short in the first innings, but Goldie was co-opted to bat at No 11 in the second innings, and scored one run. Goldie married Harriet Nicol, the daughter of a Bengal Army colonel, in 1848; among their children was John Goldie, who won fame in rowing at Cambridge and at Henley and after whom the Goldie second string Cambridge University rowing team is named."

She claimed the silver medal in the 51-kg division at the 1998 Asian Games in her native Bangkok, retrieved a bronze at the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, and later attained a fifth-place finish in the 58-kg category at the 2004 Summer Olympics, representing her nation Thailand. Sukkhongdumnoen qualified for the Thai squad in the women's featherweight class (57\u00a0kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by defeating Uzbekistan's Irina Kaydashova for the top spot and securing a berth from the Asian Olympic Qualifying Tournament in her native Bangkok. Sukkhongdumnoen had to deal with tough crowds at the start of the tournament, as she upset the Greek favorite and two-time Olympian Areti Athanasopoulou on the marginal judging decision, resulting to a 6\u20136 draw and a storming protest from the opposition. Following her surprising victory in the opening round, Sukkhongdumnoen defied odds to pummel Chinese Taipei's Chi Shu-ju in the quarterfinals by a narrow 2\u20131 margin, before she fell short on the referee's decision to U.S. taekwondo neophyte and eventual silver medalist Nia Abdallah in the semifinals. When Abdallah progressed to the final, Sukkhongdumnoen gave herself a chance for the Olympic bronze medal in the repechage, but dropped abruptly to a 3\u20136 decision against Spain's Sonia Reyes in her first playoff, relegating Sukkhongdumnoen to fifth position."
