        "title": "Led Zeppelin_Summary",
        "content": "Led Zeppelin were  an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock. Originally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"Ramble On\" and \"Whole Lotta Love\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which featured \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Ocean\", \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" and \"The Rain Song\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"Trampled Under Foot\" and \"Kashmir\". Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980. Since then, the surviving former members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums. Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 to 300\u00a0million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the Seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s."

        "content": "The Righteous Brothers are an American musical duo originally formed by Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield but now comprising Medley and Bucky Heard. Medley formed the group with Hatfield in 1963. They had first performed together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called the Paramours, and adopted the name The Righteous Brothers when they became a duo. Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and '70s, and, after several years inactive as a duo, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. The music they performed is sometimes dubbed \"blue-eyed soul\". Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges, which helped them create a distinctive sound as a duet, also both had a strong vocal talent individually that allowed them to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice, with Hatfield taking the higher-register vocals with his tenor. His voice reached the register of a countertenor. Following a year-and-a-half of Top 40 non-entries on [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboards Hot 100]], the duo hit big with the late-1964 release of what would become their signature record, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" \u2013 a transatlantic number one produced by Phil Spector, often considered one of his finest works and a landmark recording in popular music. Other notable hits include three US 1965 Top Tens \u2013 \"Just Once in My Life\" and covers of \"Unchained Melody\" (also a huge hit in 1990) and \"Ebb Tide\" \u2013 and the massive US 1966 number one \"(You're My) Soul and Inspiration\", plus the 1974 comeback hit \"Rock and Roll Heaven\". Both Hatfield and Medley also had for a time their own solo careers. In 2016, Medley re-formed The Righteous Brothers with Bucky Heard and they continue to perform as a duo. The Righteous Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked them no. 16 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time."

        "title": "The Seekers_Summary",
        "content": "The Seekers are an Australian folk-influenced pop quartet, originally formed in Melbourne in 1962. They were the first Australian pop music group to achieve major chart and sales success in the United Kingdom and the United States. They were popular during the 1960s with their best-known configuration as: Judith Durham on vocals, piano and tambourine; Athol Guy on double bass and vocals; Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar, banjo and vocals; and Bruce Woodley on guitar, mandolin, banjo and vocals. The group had Top 10 hits in the 1960s with \"I'll Never Find Another You\", \"A World of Our Own\", \"Morningtown Ride\", \"Someday, One Day\" (written by Paul Simon), \"Georgy Girl\" (the title song of the film of the same name) and \"The Carnival Is Over\" by Tom Springfield, the last being an adaptation of the Russian folk song \"Stenka Razin\". It is still one of the top 50 best-selling singles in the UK. Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as \"concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock\". In 1967, they were named as joint \"Australians of the Year\" \u2013 the only group thus honoured. In July 1968, Durham left to pursue a solo career and the group disbanded. Keith Potger formed a new group in the UK, The New Seekers, which had a hit single in 1971 with \"We'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\". Durham's band has reformed periodically. In 1995, the Seekers were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. \"I'll Never Find Another You\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011. Woodley's and Dobe Newton's song \"I Am Australian\", which was recorded by the Seekers as well as Durham with Russell Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu, has become an unofficial Australian anthem. With \"I'll Never Find Another You\" and \"Georgy Girl\", the group also achieved success in the United States, but not nearly at the same level as in the rest of the world. The Seekers have sold over 50 million records worldwide. The Seekers were individually honoured as Officers of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 2014."

        "title": "The Who_Summary",
        "content": "The Who are an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Their classic lineup consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist and singer John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th\u00a0century, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall Stack, large PA systems, the use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk rock and mod bands, and their songs are still regularly played. The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the UK top\u00a0ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"My Generation\" (1965), \"Substitute\" (1966) and \"Happy Jack\" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released \"I Can See for Miles\", their only US top\u00a0ten single. The group's 1969 concept album Tommy included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success. Further festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album Live at Leeds (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up Who's Next (1971), including the hits \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\". The group released another concept album, Quadrophenia (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after. Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th\u00a0anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996\u20131997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with Endless Wire.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album Who and toured with a symphony orchestra."

        "content": "George Michael (born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou; 25 June 1963 \u2013 25 December 2016) was an English singer, songwriter, and record producer. Known as a leading creative force in music production, songwriting, vocal performance and visual presentation, he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the MTV era. Born in East Finchley, North London, Michael rose to fame as a member of the music duo Wham! and later embarked on a solo career. Forming the duo Wham! with Andrew Ridgeley in 1981, the band's first two albums, Fantastic (1983) and Make It Big (1984), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. Their hit singles included \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" and \"Last Christmas\". Establishing themselves as a global act, Wham! toured China in April 1985; the tour was the first visit to China by a Western popular music act, and it generated worldwide media coverage. Michael's first solo single, \"Careless Whisper\", reached number one in over 20 countries, including the UK and US. Before embarking on the production of his first solo album, Michael went on to release two more number-one singles, \"A Different Corner\" and the Aretha Franklin duet \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\". Michael's debut solo album, Faith, was released in 1987, topping the UK Albums Chart and staying at number one on the Billboard 200 for 12 weeks. Globally it sold 25 million copies, and four singles from the album\u2014\"Faith\", \"Father Figure\", \"One More Try\", and \"Monkey\"\u2014reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Michael became the best-selling music artist of 1988, and Faith was awarded Album of the Year at the 1989 Grammy Awards. His second solo album, Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 (1990), sold approximately eight million copies and was a UK number-one. It included the Billboard Hot 100 number-one \"Praying for Time\" and the worldwide hit \"Freedom! '90\". A 1991 live duet with Elton John, \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\", was also a transatlantic number one. Michael went on to release two more multimillion-selling albums, Older (1996) and Patience (2004). Michael came out as gay in 1998. He was an active LGBT rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser. Michael's personal life, drug use, and legal troubles made headlines during the late 1990s and 2000s, as he was arrested for public lewdness in 1998 and was arrested for multiple drug-related offences after that time. The 2005 documentary A Different Story covered his career and personal life. Michael's 25 Live tour spanned three tours from 2006 to 2008. Michael fell into a coma in 2011 during a bout with pneumonia, but later recovered. He performed his final concert at London's Earls Court in 2012. On 25 December 2016, Michael was found dead at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Michael is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 120 million records worldwide. He achieved seven number-one songs on the UK Singles Chart and eight number-one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100. Michael won various music awards, including two Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, and six Ivor Novello Awards. In 2015, he was ranked 45th in Billboards list of the \"Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time\". The Radio Academy named him the most played artist on British radio during the period 1984\u20132004."

        "content": "Bookends is the fourth studio album by American music duo Simon & Garfunkel. Produced by Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel and Roy Halee, the album was released on April 3, 1968, in the United States by Columbia Records. The duo had risen to fame two years prior with the albums Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme and the soundtrack album for the 1967 film The Graduate. Bookends is a concept album that explores a life journey from childhood to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of previously-released singles and of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon (no relation), who joined the recording when Paul Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967. Initial sales for Bookends were substantial in the US, and the album produced the number-one single \"Mrs. Robinson\". The album sold well in the US and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number one. Bookends was considered a breakthrough for the duo, placing them on the same level as artists such as Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones at the forefront of the cultural movement in the 1960s. The album has continued to receive critical acclaim and is debated by critics as to whether it or Bridge Over Troubled Water is Simon & Garfunkel's best album."

        "title": "Revolver (Beatles album)_Summary",
        "content": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single \"Eleanor Rigby\" / \"Yellow Submarine\". The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds, and lyrical content. The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the group's psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its tracks are \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", incorporating heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; \"Eleanor Rigby\", a song about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and \"Love You To\", a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also produced a non-album single, \"Paperback Writer\" backed with \"Rain\". In the United Kingdom, the album's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release. In North America, Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records, with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today. The release there coincided with the Beatles' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon's remark that the band had become \"more popular than Jesus\". The album topped the Record Retailer chart in the UK for seven weeks and the US Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks. Critical reaction was highly favourable in the UK but less so in the US amid the press's unease at the band's outspokenness on contemporary issues. Revolver expanded the boundaries of pop music, revolutionised standard practices in studio recording, advanced principles espoused by the 1960s counterculture, and inspired the development of psychedelic rock, electronica, progressive rock and world music. The album cover, designed by Klaus Voormann, combined Aubrey Beardsley-inspired line drawing with photo collage and won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. Aided by the 1987 international CD release, which standardised its content to the original Parlophone version, Revolver has surpassed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in many critics' estimation as the Beatles' best album. It was ranked first in the 1998 and 2000 editions of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums and third in the 2003 and 2012 editions of Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It has been certified double platinum by the BPI and 5\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA."

Their music is best known for its merging of dissonant guitar textures, androgynous vocals, and unorthodox production techniques. They helped to pioneer the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegaze during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Following several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released several successful EPs and the albums Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991) on the label; the latter is often described as their magnum opus and one of the best albums of the 1990s. However, they were dropped by Creation after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, the band signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive. Googe and \u00d3 C\u00edos\u00f3ig left the band in 1995, and were followed by Butcher in 1997.

Brown was a 1993 inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Following a resurgence that began in the mid-1970s and peaked in the 1980s, Brown used her influence to press for musicians' rights regarding royalties and contracts; these efforts led to the founding of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Her performances in the Broadway musical Black and Blue earned Brown a Tony Award, and the original cast recording won a Grammy Award.

Its influence is notorious in future bands that would boost the youth crew movement, also in other genres such as grunge, post-hardcore, 90's skate punk and thrash metal, as well in the development of the New York hardcore music scene and aesthetics style. This album\u2019s increased complexity in songs, with more elaborate riffs and arrangements, is its main distinguishing factor compared to the band\u2019s previous recordings. The bass octaves retain the dynamics of the guitar line. For this album Brian Baker became second guitarist and Steven Hansgen joined the bass. The lyrics of the majority of the songs reflect self-reflection, youth frustration, personal problems and difficulties with friendships, in contrast to that of Minor Threat's first recordings (which contained a politically critical message and as opposed to drug use)."

She has earned 11 Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music awards, an Emmy Award, and an ALMA Award. Many of her albums have been certified gold, platinum or multiplatinum in the United States and internationally. She has also earned nominations for a Tony Award and a Golden Globe award. She was awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award by the Latin Recording Academy in 2011 and also awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award by the Recording Academy in 2016. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014. On July 28, 2014, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities. In 2019, she received a star jointly with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their work as the group Trio. Ronstadt was among five honorees who received the 2019 Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime artistic achievements. Ronstadt has released 24 studio albums and 15 compilation or greatest hits albums. She charted 38 US Billboard Hot 100 singles. Twenty-one of those singles reached the top 40, ten reached the top 10, and one reached number one (\"You're No Good\").

She announced her retirement in 2011 and revealed shortly afterwards that she is no longer able to sing as a result of a degenerative condition later determined to be progressive supranuclear palsy. Since then, Ronstadt has continued to make public appearances, going on a number of public speaking tours in the 2010s. She published an autobiography, Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir, in September 2013. A documentary based on her memoirs, Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice, was released in 2019."

He was active in two distinct periods, first in the heyday of early rhythm and blues and later in the resurgence of interest in traditional jazz after the founding of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1970.  His piano style has been described as \"instantly recognizable, combining rumba, mambo, and calypso\". Music journalist Tony Russell (in his book The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray) wrote that \"The vivacious rhumba-rhythmed piano blues and choked singing typical of Fess were too weird to sell millions of records; he had to be content with siring musical offspring who were simple enough to manage that, like Fats Domino or Huey \"Piano\" Smith. But he is also acknowledged as a father figure by subtler players like Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.\""

        "content": "Up to Date is the second studio album by The Partridge Family. Released in February 1971, just four months after the group's debut LP, the album entered Billboard's Top LP's chart in early April, having been certified gold on 25 March 1971. In its fourth week on the Top 200, the album improved on its predecessor (a no. 4 peak), reaching no. 3 (behind Janis Joplin's Pearl and Jesus Christ Superstar). Up to Date yielded the two big pop hits \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" (Billboard no. 6/Cash Box number one) and \"I'll Meet You Halfway\" (Billboard no. 9),  which respectively reached the Top Ten of Billboard's  Hot 100 in March and June. In Canada both \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" and its parent album reached number one  on the RPM charts. As with all Partridge Family albums (with the exception of Bulletin Board), Up to Date was produced by Wes Farrell at United Western Recorders, Studio 2 in Los Angeles. And as with the group's first album, it was engineered by Bob Kovach, with arrangements by Mike Melvoin. Consistent with all of the Partridge Family's studio output, the album features musicians associated with iconic Los Angeles-based session players \"the Wrecking Crew\": Hal Blaine (drums), Joe Osborn (bass guitar), Mike Melvoin (keyboard), Dennis Budimir (guitar) and Louie Shelton (guitar). And once again members of overlapping studio groups the Ron Hicklin Singers and the Love Generation \u2013 brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward \u2013 feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album. The album features three songs written by \"I Think I Love You\" songwriter Tony Romeo, who contributed material to all eight of the Partridge Family's studio albums. The LP also includes five songs co-written by Wes Farrell, including three with prolific lyricist Gerry Goffin (former songwriting partner of Carole King). And two of the songs \u2013 including the hit \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" \u2013 were co-written by Wes Farrell, Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, whose five Partridge Family songs as a songwriting trio include \"I Can Feel Your Heartbeat\". Between 1972 and 1975 Appel worked as manager and producer for Bruce Springsteen. Up to Date features David Cassidy's first contribution as a songwriter. With Wes Farrell he co-wrote the song \"Lay It on the Line\". The recording introduced a distorted guitar sound to the group's repertoire. Cassidy publicly despised one of the LP's hits, \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\", and making it proved to be a very hard task. He didn't think it was a good song at all and hated the idea of his having to talk in the middle of it so much so he refused to do it. This caused consternation with the studio and the record company, prompting the involvement of the heads of both Bell Records and Screen Gems, which at the time were the respective record and television divisions of the major Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures. Production shooting of the TV series was halted in order to provide a place in time where his manager and agent could talk to him over the issue. One of the things they were saying was about how many more copies of the record would be sold if it contained a speaking role from him. They put pressure on him until he caved in and did the record as requested.  When it was finished, he was unsuccessful in trying to keep the record shelved in Bell's vaults. His feelings toward the song remained negative: The album's distinctive cover (overseen by Bell Records art director Beverly Weinstein) was designed in the form of a calendar indicating the birth dates of the family (including dog Simone), which were the actual birth dates of the cast members. The album also included a book cover. This was the last album to feature Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge on the cover, as he left the show soon after the album's release."

Widely regarded as \"one of jazz's finest clarinetists\", Shaw led one of the United States' most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s. Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine.\" Before the release of \"Beguine,\" Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as Monty Norman in England, with the vamp of the James Bond Theme, possibly influenced by 1938's \"Nightmare\". Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the big bands he led. He served in the US Navy from 1942 to 1944, during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific. Following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954."

Records in the US. The album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and Johnny Rotten's sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game-changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the most important and best albums of all time. The band's internal relationships were always volatile, and the lineup saw changes during the recording of the album.  Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only performed bass on \"Anarchy in the U.K.\".  Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs the band wrote after he joined.  While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead.  Drummer Paul Cook and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track.  The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers. By the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were already controversial, having sworn on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"bollocks\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. Due in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts. It achieved advance orders of 125,000 copies after a week of its release and went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. The album has also been certified platinum by the RIAA. It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2017. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine named the album the second best of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The same magazine ranked it number 80 on their list of 500 greatest albums of all time in 2020. In 2006, it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever."

AllMusic considered the album's music to be \"surprisingly cerebral and arty\"; alternative tunings and odd time signatures were present on several of the album's songs, and lyrics were intended to be ambiguous and evocative. The focus on the Seattle grunge scene helped bring attention to Badmotorfinger, and the singles \"Outshined\" and \"Rusty Cage\" were able to find an audience in rock radio and MTV. Badmotorfinger became the band's highest charting album at the time on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at number 39.

        "content": "Shpongle is a psychedelic electronic music project from England that formed in 1996.  The group includes Simon Posford (a.k.a. Hallucinogen) and Raja Ram (one of three in The Infinity Project). The duo are considered to be one of the progenitors of the psybient genre - a genre combining world music with psychedelic trance and ambient. Their musical style combines traditional music from all over the globe and vocals with contemporary western synthesizer-based psychedelic music. When asked to describe Shpongle's music, Posford has responded that it is \"like nothing you've ever heard before.\" Shpongle's first track, \"Vapour Rumours\", was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in 1996. Their debut album, Are You Shpongled?, was released in 1998 on Twisted Records. On 9 September 2014, Posford confirmed beginning work on a sixth album, which was released as Codex VI on October 23rd 2017. On 3 October, even before the release of Codex VI, the duo announced via a Facebook video that they have begun working on their seventh studio album. Since June 30th, the duo have also been releasing remasters of their previous albums, focussing on releasing special edition vinyl records. Posford is generally responsible for the synthesizers, studio work, and live instrumentation, while Raja Ram contributes broad musical concepts and flute arrangements. Raja Ram stated in an interview that \"Shpongle\" is an umbrella term for feeling positive and euphoric emotions. Shpongle's music is heavily influenced by psychedelic experiences and frequently makes use of sonic textures that approximate psychedelic states as well as vocal samples relating to consciousness expansion, hallucinations, and altered states of awareness. For example, the track \"A New Way to Say 'Hooray'\", contains a vocal sample of Terence McKenna describing the effects of DMT."

The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels, the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock. Creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed Sebadoh and Folk Implosion. His replacement, Mike Johnson, came aboard for three major-label albums. Murph eventually quit, with Mascis taking over drum duties on the band's albums before the group disbanded in 1997. The original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing five albums thereafter. Mascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s classic rock and characterized by extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s."

Recording sessions for the album took place during 2003 to 2004, with its production handled by his longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, along with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Lil Jon, among others. Primarily an R&B album, Confessions showcases Usher as a crooner through a mixture of ballads and up-tempos, incorporating musical genres of dance-pop, hip hop and crunk. The album's themes generated controversy about Usher's personal relationships; however, the album's primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the album reflects Dupri's own personal story. In the United States, the album sold 1.1 million copies in its first week. To boost sales amid threats of bootlegging, the special edition for the album was issued, which includes the single, \"My Boo\"; a duet with Alicia Keys. Confessions earned Usher several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album. According to Billboard, it is the second-best selling album of the 2000s decade in the United States, behind Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP. With over eight million copies sold in 2004, the album was viewed as a sign of recovering album sales in the US, following three years of decline. It was also exemplary of urban music's commercial peak and dominance of the Billboard charts in 2004. Confessions has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2016, has sold over 10.3 million copies in the US and over 15 million copies worldwide."

P-Orridge was also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental pop rock band Psychic TV. Born in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, P-Orridge moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted Genesis P-Orridge as their pseudonym. On returning to Hull, P-Orridge founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 Prostitution show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \"wreckers of civilisation.\" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was often seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, P-Orridge married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \"pandrogyne\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, P-Orridge retired from music to focus on other artistic mediums in 2009. P-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases during their lifetime. They were cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and had been given the moniker of the \"Godparent of Industrial Music\". P-Orridge went by gender-neutral pronouns."

Most of the album was recorded following a grueling tour during which the band was left with little time to compose new material. Producer Paul A. Rothchild recommended a total departure from the Doors' first three albums: develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass and string arrangements provided by Paul Harris. Lead singer Jim Morrison, who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry, was less involved in the songwriting process, leaving guitarist Robby Krieger to increase his own creative output. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, but it failed to retain audiences in the UK and other European countries that their previous album, Waiting for the Sun, had succeeded in engaging. Three preceding singles, \"Touch Me\", \"Wishful Sinful\", and \"Tell All the People\", were included on The Soft Parade, with the former becoming another Top 10 hit for the Doors. Another single, \"Runnin' Blue\", also followed the album's distribution. Upon release, The Soft Parade was denounced by both music critics and the band's underground music scene followers, who viewed the album as the Doors' trending into popular music. Over time, historians have reassessed the album and its critical standing has slightly improved, but it is still widely considered the group's weakest effort with Morrison."

The album is dedicated to Nector Rorris, the proprietor of Nectar's in Burlington, Vermont, where Phish played their first bar gig followed by a series of monthly three-night stands, saying that the experience \"taught us how to play\". There are two versions of the album's cover. The first printings of the CD were issued in longbox format, and the title of the album was not printed on the CD insert itself. Later printings came in shrink-wrap format and had the band's name and album title printed directly on the insert. The songs on A Picture of Nectar explore a variety of musical genres, including jazz, country, calypso, rock and roll and neo-psychedelia. Tracks 2, 8, 9, and 14 are instrumentals. The song \"Manteca\" is a cover of the song by jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie; in Phish's short version, the melody line is sung as a goofy nonsense phrase. \"Poor Heart\" is written in bluegrass style. The latin jazz instrumental \"The Landlady\" is performed by the band both in a standalone rendition and as part of the longer song \"Punch You in the Eye\". All songs on the album have been performed live by the band, though the instrumental tracks have become relative rarities after the mid-1990s. The short instrumental, \"Faht\", written by drummer Jon Fishman, has only been performed live twelve times, the last in 1995. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on November 15, 2001."

The next morning, Prince had composed two songs, one of which was \"When Doves Cry\".

The music video, directed by Prince, premiered on MTV in June 1984. It opens with white doves emerging from double doors to reveal Prince in a bathtub, then shows him performing the song in various scenes. The video sparked controversy among network executives, who thought that its sexual nature was too explicit for television. \"When Doves Cry\" is ranked No. 37 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 31st most celebrated song in popular music history."

The record was not originally pressed with a Parental Advisory sticker on the cover. However, Atlantic Records did have a problem with some of the sexual metaphors mentioned in \"Hard for Love\" and \"Skull Session.\" It was also a marketing ploy to encourage more people to buy the record as a result of it being \"banned\" by some outlets. This was bassist Keith Collins's last album with the band. Jon and Criss Oliva were not completely happy with Collins' playing and corrected some of his mistakes for the final version.

It received favorable reviews, but sold poorly, reaching number 151 on the US record charts during a four-week stay and becoming the lowest-charting Beach Boys album to that point. \"Add Some Music to Your Day\" was the only single that charted in the US, peaking at number 64. In the UK, the album peaked at number 29. Working titles for the album included Reverberation, Add Some Music, and The Fading Rock Group Revival. The recording sessions began in January 1969, and, after a year-long search for a new record contract, completed in July 1970. In contrast to 20/20, the record featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. About four dozen songs were written for the album, and the label rejected numerous revisions of its track listing before the band presented enough formidable material deemed satisfactory for release. It includes \"This Whole World\", one of Brian Wilson's most complex songs, \"Forever\", regarded as among Dennis Wilson's finest, and \"Cool, Cool Water\", a song that originated from the band's Smile sessions. Fans generally consider Sunflower to be the Beach Boys' finest post-Pet Sounds album. It has appeared in several critics' and listeners' polls for the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's  \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" (2003). The track \"All I Wanna Do\" was later cited as one of the earliest examples of dream pop and chillwave. Many Sunflower outtakes and leftover songs later appeared on subsequent Beach Boys releases, including the follow-up Surf's Up (1971) and the compilation Feel Flows (2021)."

These albums all earned Gold or higher certification, and produced several Top Ten singles, including his debut \"Should've Been a Cowboy\", which topped the country charts and was the most-played country song of the 1990s. The song has received three million spins since its release, according to Broadcast Music Incorporated. Signed to DreamWorks Records Nashville in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single \"How Do You Like Me Now?!\" in late 1999. This song, the title track to his 1999 album of the same name, was the number one country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, Pull My Chain, Unleashed, and Shock'n Y'all, produced three more number ones each, and all of the albums were certified 4x Platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released Honkytonk University. When DreamWorks closed in 2005, Keith founded the label Show Dog Nashville, which merged with Universal South Records to become Show Dog-Universal Music in December 2009.

It was her first new studio album since 1998's Christmas album These Are Special Times. Dion returned to the music scene after a two-year hiatus when she gave birth to her first child in 2001. She collaborated on A New Day Has Come with various producers, including Anders Bagge and Peer \u00c5str\u00f6m for the first time. A New Day Has Come garnered mostly positive reviews from the music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a \"broader, more adventurous\" range of pop music and \"dips its toe\" into modern music, particularly dance-pop (\"Sorry for Love\"). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like \"I Surrender\", \"Have You Ever Been in Love\", and the title track. Critics also praised \"Ten Days\", \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\", \"I'm Alive\", \"When the Wrong One Loves You Right\", \"The Greatest Reward\", and two covers: \"Nature Boy\" and \"At Last\". A New Day Has Come became a commercial success throughout the world and entered number one in more than seventeen countries. It has sold 3.3 million units in the United States and was certified three-times Platinum by the RIAA. In Canada, after shipping 600,000 copies, the album was certified six-times Platinum. The IFPI certified it three-times Platinum for selling three million units in Europe. Overall, A New Day Has Come has sold 12 million copies worldwide. The first single, \"A New Day Has Come\" was released in March 2002 and peaked inside the top ten in Canada and Europe. In the United States, it reached number twenty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and broke the record for most weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, staying on top for twenty-one weeks. The next single, \"I'm Alive\" was issued in August 2002 and also peaked inside the top ten in numerous European countries. The last commercial single, \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" was released in November 2002 and performed moderately on the charts, reaching the top forty in Europe."

The song was written, composed, and recorded very quickly but the result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. \"Wannabe\" is a moderately paced dance-pop song which features Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over the heterosexual bond, became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's Girl Power philosophy. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the song won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards. \"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted by the group. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a big success on the British cable network The Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across the United Kingdom, while the group performed it on television programmes and started doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. Responding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a double Platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The song was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, \"Wannabe\" had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 37. \"Wannabe\" became the best-selling single by a girl group in the world, with 1,385,211 and 2,910,000 copies sold in United Kingdom (by 2017) and United States (by 2014), respectively, and over 7 million copies worldwide by the end of 1997. In a 2014 study, it was found to be the most easily recognisable pop song of the last 60 years. An EP titled Wannabe 25 was released in 2021 to mark the single's 25th anniversary."

Over the years, several other members of Ministry played with Lard, namely Bill Rieflin, Mike Scaccia, and Rey Washam. Like most of Biafra's work, Lard's songs are angrily political (the War on Drugs is a particularly common theme) but often have a tinge of humor. Lard has not officially toured and has only performed live a handful of times, mostly around the San Francisco area (where Jello lives and operates his Alternative Tentacles record label). The band played during Ministry's 1988 tour and throughout their 1989\u20131990 dates, once in Chicago after wrapping the recording of The Last Temptation of Reid, once at the conclusion of a Ministry concert in Los Angeles (March 24, 2003), and at the San Francisco (September 26, 2004), Portland (September 28, 2004) and Seattle (September 29, 2004) dates of Ministry's Evil Doer tour. Because its key members are active with other projects, it is unlikely that the band will tour. According to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which was to be recorded in Jourgensen's El Paso studio. However, according to a January 2010 interview with Jello Biafra, he indicated that a new Lard album was unlikely, saying \"Me and Al have talked about it for years, but we've never been able to nail down a time to try and put it together.\"."

It was recorded in early 1985 at Weryton Studios, Munich, following a turbulent period: co-founder, lead guitarist and co-principal songwriter Mick Jones and drummer Topper Headon had been dismissed by lead vocalist Joe Strummer and bassist Paul Simonon. Jones and Headon were replaced  by three unknowns: guitarists Vince White and Nick Sheppard and drummer Pete Howard. During the tense recording sessions, Clash manager Bernie Rhodes and Strummer fought each other for control over the band's songwriting and musical direction. Strummer and Rhodes co-wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes took charge of the arrangements, track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for synthetic drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of sampling, were widely derided. One writer described the album's sound as brash and seemingly \"designed to sound hip and modern\u2014'80s style!\". Rhodes chose the album title, taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. On release, Cut the Crap was maligned in the UK music press as \"one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist\". Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release. The recording process and tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for a lead single. The album was poorly received upon release, and is still generally regarded as the band's worst album; Strummer performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash's compilations and box sets. Some retrospective assessments have been more sympathetic; a number of critics and writers have praised Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\"."

The album is titled after the concept of \"All\" invented by drummer Bill Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion in 1980. Based on the goals of achieving \"the total extent\" and \"to not settle for some, to always go for All\", the philosophy was the subject of the one-second title track, the two-second \"No, All!\", and \"All-O-Gistics\". All marked the end of the Descendents' original run. Following two tours of the United States to promote the album, singer Milo Aukerman left the group to pursue a career in biochemistry. The band was relaunched under the new name All, and released eight albums with other singers between 1988 and 1995, before reuniting with Aukerman under the Descendents name."

It is their fourth studio album with Columbia Records and the follow-up to their popular album fear, which was released in 1991. Two songs from Dulcinea charted on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts: \"Fall Down\" and \"Something's Always Wrong\". Dulcinea was RIAA Certified Gold on September 1, 1994 and Platinum on July 31, 1995. The album's name is a reference to the love interest in Miguel de Cervantes' classic Spanish novel, Don Quixote.  At least two songs on the album allude to themes found in the novel. \"Crowing\" is a song about a person who does not know how to hold on to a lover. \"Windmills\" is a metaphorical song about how people spend much of their lives chasing absurd or impossible pursuits  (the allusion being to a specific scene in Don Quixote where the title character uselessly attacks a windmill). The album's artwork (illustrated by influential artist Jason Holley) also explores Cervantes' windmill metaphor, depicting the incongruence between the way things are and how we tend to perceive them. Dulcinea also delves into some spiritual themes. \"Fly from Heaven\" is sung from the perspective of James, who is portrayed as Jesus' literal brother and is upset by Paul's manipulation of Jesus' word. \"Begin\" and \"Reincarnation Song\" each explore questions about death and the afterlife. Glen Phillips has said that Dulcinea is probably his favorite Toad album because they started to know what they were doing but weren't overthinking things yet."

She co-wrote and produced the entire album with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard. True Blue deals with her visions of love, work, dreams as well as disappointments, and was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn, to whom Madonna dedicated the album. Musically, the songs on the album took a different direction from her previous endeavours, incorporating classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music. The album features instrumentation from acoustic guitars, drums, synthesizers and Cuban musical instruments. The topic for the songs range from love, freedom, and in the case of \"Papa Don't Preach\", social issues like teenage pregnancy. After its release, True Blue received critical acclaim, with music critics who complimented the album as the archetype of the late 1980s and early 1990s pop albums. They also praised the fact that Madonna's voice sounded stronger than it did on her previous efforts, while commending Madonna's skills as a singer, songwriter and entertainer. True Blue was an immediate global success, reaching number one in then record-breaking 28 countries across the world, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It spent 34 consecutive weeks at the top of the European Top 100 Albums chart, longer than any other album in history. It became the world's top-selling album of 1986, as well as the best-selling album of the 1980s by a female artist. With estimated sales of over 25 million copies worldwide, True Blue remains one of the best-selling albums of all time. Five singles released from the album\u2014\"Live to Tell\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"True Blue\", \"Open Your Heart\", and \"La Isla Bonita\"\u2014all reached number one on either the US Billboard Hot 100 or the UK Singles Chart, with \"Papa Don't Preach\" being the track that topped both. The album was promoted on Madonna's second concert tour, 1987's Who's That Girl World Tour, which visited cities in North America, Europe and Asia. True Blue is credited as being the album which established Madonna's position as the biggest female artist of the 1980s, rivaling male musicians like Michael Jackson and Prince. The album's singles and their accompanying music videos have sparked debates among scholars and social groups. She became the first female artist to receive the Video Vanguard Award at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in recognition of her impact on popular culture. The album also gave her first appearance on the Guinness Book of World Records."

They chose Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore to produce the album, with whom they developed a strong rapport. Recording took place from November to December 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. Musically, Revolutions per Minute is rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. Critics noted that the album exhibited greater musical maturity and an overall darker tone when compared to its predecessor. It comprises thirteen songs, with lyrical themes ranging from relationships and politics. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively with other Fat Wreck Chords bands, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour. Upon its release, the album peaked at number 35 on the Independent Albums chart, and was praised for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of genres. Some critics called it one of the best albums of the year.

The album also introduced several aspects that would become common traits in Rise Against's newer material, such as extensive social commentary, and reliance on musical accessibility.

The album is a follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Executive produced by Clive Davis, Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, in pursuit of a pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is primarily a pop rock record with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R&B-oriented sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism. Breakaway received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album's new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson's vocal performances. It received several awards and nominations, including winning two Grammy Awards and receiving a nomination for a Juno Award. The album became a commercial success worldwide. By selling over 12 million copies worldwide, Breakaway is Clarkson's best selling album of her career so far, and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 in the United States, it stayed on the top twenty of the chart for more than a year, eventually being certified 6\u00d7 multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of more than six million copies. Breakaways singles \"Since U Been Gone\", \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", \"Because of You\", \"Walk Away\", and \"Breakaway\" became worldwide hits and have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being certified platinum in over 17 countries. To promote the album, Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway World Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. Billboard placed the album 77th in  the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums."

The albums features appearances from rappers Dead Prez and Common, along with singers Queen Latifah, Bahamadia, and Angie Stone. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 143,561 copies in its first week.

Following the release of their third studio The Changing of Times (2002), half of the band's members were replaced. After finalizing the line-up with vocalist Spencer Chamberlain, in February 2004, the band recorded their next release with producer James Paul Wisner at his home studio Wisner Productions. The album has been tagged with genres including screamo and melodic hardcore. Drummer Aaron Gillespie had more of a vocal presence to contrast Chamberlain's screams. Before the album's release, Underoath undertook a tour with their labelmates and later with Eighteen Visions. Throughout 2004, the band went on the Warped Tour before going on their own headlining tour, and closed the year supporting Coheed and Cambria. \"Reinventing Your Exit\" was released as the lead single in February 2005. An appearance on the inaugural Taste of Chaos tour led to another headlining US tour, shows in Europe and a second spell on Warped Tour. A Canadian tour in late 2005 with the Used preceded a reissue of the album in October 2005. It received generally favorable reviews from music critics, some of whom highlighted the various musical styles and praised Underoath for its accessibility. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album gold in the US in 2011, and it was nominated for a Dove Award for best rock album.

Born in Portland, Oregon, Olsen played the drums and attended the University of Michigan, where he was drum major. There he formed his band, George Olsen and his Music, which continued in the Portland area. The group's debut hotel engagement came at the Multnomah Hotel in Portland. He then made the cross-county transition to Broadway, appearing in Kid Boots (1923), the Ziegfeld Follies of 1924, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925, and Good News (1927). George Olsen and his Music were prolific Victor recording artists and their records are among the most numerous found by record collectors today, testifying to their original popularity. He and his orchestra were in Eddie Cantor's 1928 Broadway hit Whoopee!, and in the 1930 movie version. In the Follies George met a singer, Ethel Shutta, who sings and dances memorably in Whoopee!, and they married, appearing together in nightclubs and on radio. They had two children, George Jr. and Charles; following a divorce, Olsen opened a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey.  Olsen and Shutta were heard on the Oldsmobile Program on CBS radio in 1933. He also was an orchestra leader for The Jack Benny Program on radio. Olsen signed with Victor in 1924 and remained as one of Victor's most popular bands until 1933 when he signed with Columbia. He stayed with Columbia through January, 1934. He recorded a single session in 1938 for Decca, and one final date for the rare Varsity label in 1940. Olsen's bands produced few stars. Singer-saxophonist Fred MacMurray passed through in 1930 on his way to eventual movie stardom, recording a vocal on I'm in the Market for You. Olsen's long-time alto saxist and singer, Fran Frey, with his distinctive, reedy bass-baritone, was perhaps the best known Olsenite until he left in 1933 for a career as a music director in radio. In 1936, Olsen became leader of Orville Knapp's band after Knapp died in a plane crash. Olsen was chosen to lead the band by Knapp's widow. Morale problems plagued the group, and in 1938, after many musicians had already left, the group disbanded. A resident of  Paramus, New Jersey, Olsen ran a popular local restaurant there on Paramus Road for many years before he died there on March 18, 1971. According to John S. Wilson in The New York Times, reviewing a retrospective of Olsen's recording \"George Olsen and His Music\" on RCA-Victor, in 1968, Olsen had a restaurant in Paramus, NJ called \"George Olsen's\". Wilson noted that \"Olsen is there every day greeting guests at lunch and dinner... In the background, the original George Olsen records of the Twenties play softly. After his divorce from Shutta, Olsen married Claralee Pilcer."

It was written and produced by Carey, Robert Clivill\u00e9s, and David Cole of C+C Music Factory and released as the album's lead single on August 13, 1991. The song's lyrics has its protagonist going through a variety of emotions from high to low, up to the point where she declares, \"You got me feeling emotions.\" Musically, it is a gospel and R&B heavily influenced by 1970s disco music and showcases Carey's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register. \"Emotions\" received positive reviews from music critics, who mainly praised Carey's vocal performance. The song became Carey's fifth consecutive number one song in the United States, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks, making her the first (and till date) the only act to have their first five singles top the chart. Internationally, it was a moderate success, topping the Canadian Singles Chart, and reaching the top 10 in Greece, Netherlands, and New Zealand.

Their stated goal is to use their music to bring ancient history and mythology into the modern era especially to build awareness of the myths of Taiwan and tragic events in that country's history (for example, those experienced by the Seediq people). Since 2011 their trademark erhu has been complemented with stringed instruments including the koto and shamisen, as well as Tibetan Bells and shakuhachi and pgaki flutes, the latter of which are traditionally used by the aboriginal people of Taiwan. The band members are also acclaimed artists and political activists who advocate independence for Taiwan and self-determination for Tibetans and Uighurs. Singer Freddy Lim served as Chairman of the Taiwan chapter of Amnesty International from 2010 to 2014 and has been a legislator since 2016, first representing the New Power Party before becoming an independent. Since their formation, Chthonic has released eight studio albums. Their most recent full-length record, Battlefields of Asura, was released in October 2018."

In 1970, while still active with Jefferson Airplane, Kantner and several Bay Area musicians recorded the album Blows Against the Empire, which was co-credited to both Paul Kantner and \"Jefferson Starship\". Jefferson Airplane continued to record and perform until 1973. Kantner revived the Jefferson Starship name in 1974 and continued to record and perform with them through 1984. He later led a reformed Jefferson Starship from 1992 until his death in 2016. Kantner had the longest continuous membership with the band, with 19 years in the original run of Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship and 24 years in the revived Jefferson Starship.

M2M were frequently praised for writing most of their songs and performing their own instruments, something which was considered to set them aside from the majority of teen pop music artists. Their debut single, \"Don't Say You Love Me\" (1999), was both a critical and commercial success, and remained their biggest hit. Their debut album, Shades of Purple (2000), was critically acclaimed and sold over 1.5 million units worldwide. Despite critical acclaim, their second album, The Big Room (2001), did not perform as well commercially, and the duo broke up in 2002, with each pursuing a solo career. A greatest hits album, The Day You Went Away: The Best of M2M (2003), was released after they disbanded. M2M sold over 2 million albums."

After releasing two albums worldwide, Rise from the Ashes (1998) and Eternal Crusade (2000), the band had changed their singer and formed Highland Glory. With a fresh new start and an increased potential, the band developed their style of melodic metal in a heavier and more traditional direction on the debut album, From the Cradle to the Brave (2003). The artwork was created by Mark Wilkinson (famous for his work with Marillion, Fish, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, etc.), who has worked for the band ever since. Still signed to Face Front (the label run by Frode \u00d8ien, chief editor of Scream Magazine) for Scandinavia, but the debut-album was licensed to Massacre Records for the rest of the world. The follow-up \u201cForever Endeavour\u201d (2005) took the different aspects of the band's sound even further, showing a natural, yet darker and more atmospheric progression. In the autumn of 2007 singer Jan Thore Grefstad left the band, and was replaced by Trine Elise Johansen in the winter of 2008. The change from a male to a female singer naturally affected the band's sound, but the trademark still proved to be intact on the album \"Twist of Faith\" (2011), yet the band had developed in a more mid-tempo and even more melodic direction. Having previously only toured their native country, the band finally got to play outside of Norway, in both Sweden and Germany. The band parted ways with singer Trine Elise Johansen, keyboard-player/guitarist Lars Andre Larsen and drummer Morten F\u00e6r\u00f8vig during the autumn and winter of 2011. A year later guitarist Per Olav Olsen, drummer Stian Andre Braathen, keyboard-player Halvor Gustafson and singer H\u00e5vard Indreb\u00f8 finally completed the new line-up, which only lasted a year. The band's original singer Jan Thore Grefstad returned in the winter of 2013, after showcasing his talent in Swedish metal band Saint Deamon, Norske Talenter (Norway's Got Talent) and The Voice \u2013 Norges beste stemme. On January 29, 2017, guitarist Jack Roger Olsen announced his departure from the band via the band's official Facebook page, citing lack of motivation and progress."

Other singles released achieved major success, including \"Water Runs Dry\", which reached No. 2, and \"Thank You\", which reached No. 21. \"Vibin'\", however, only reached No. 52. The spoken track \"Khalil (Interlude)\" is a tribute to their road manager Khalil Roundtree who was shot in Chicago, Illinois while the band was opening for MC Hammer's Too Legit to Quit tour. II became the inaugural winner of the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, first presented at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995. According to producer Bob Robinson of the duo Tim & Bob, he and his partner Tim Kelley were asked by Boyz II Men to produce most of II. However, Motown Records then-president Jheryl Busby did not feel comfortable with the idea of two unknown producers dominating a second album from a group that was one of the biggest acts in the world at the time. As a result, Busby brought in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Babyface to deliver hit singles for the project. Busby insisted on \"I'll Make Love to You\" being the first single, despite objections from the group- who felt there were songs that could have been much stronger singles. The song became one of Boyz II Men's biggest hits. Over 20 songs were recorded for II, but most of them never made the final track listing.

(The recording did not include most of the music written by Gershwin which had been customarily cut from productions in the United States, however. As opposed to the complete three-hour opera, the album was two hours and nine minutes.) The recording came about as a result of Lehman Engel and Goddard Lieberson's desire to record albums of Broadway shows whose scores had never been put on disc. Among the musicals the team had recorded (or would record) were Oh, Kay!, Babes in Arms, Girl Crazy, and Pal Joey.  Although there had been an album of Porgy and Bess since 1940, there had never been a 3-LP version. The 1951 album set contained more than two-thirds of the opera, for the first time ever in the history of recording. The album was recorded between April 5 and April 13, 1951. The album was originally released on 3 twelve-inch 33 rpm LPs. Columbia Masterworks assigned the album the catalog number OSL 162.

He contacted Jackson, who came up with the title, after which Wildhorn completed the music and lyrics for the song. Smokey Robinson originally wanted to record the song; however, Wildhorn and Jackson held the song for Houston. Initially, Houston did not want to record the song, feeling there was no special message to convey. In a 2000 interview, Houston reminisced that she \"hated the song\". However, Davis believed the song would go to number one if she recorded it, so she agreed.

        "content": "Easy Action is the second studio album by the American rock band Alice Cooper, released by Straight Records in March 1970. The title comes from a line from one of the band's favorite films, the musical West Side Story. As with Pretties for You, the band's debut from the previous year, Easy Action was neither a commercial nor critical success. Singles include \"Shoe Salesman\" and \"Return of the Spiders\". Drummer Neal Smith later said of the record producer David Briggs, \"David hated our music and us. I recall the term that he used, referring to our music, was 'Psychedelic Shit'. I think Easy Action sounded too dry, more like a TV or radio commercial and he did not help with song arrangement or positive input in any way.\" None of Easy Action\u2019s songs have ever been performed live by Cooper since the tour in support of their third album Love It to Death; in fact, only \"Return of the Spiders\" was performed on the tour for that album. A small number of early U.S. copies were pressed on the blue Bizarre Records label.  These copies carry the same catalog number WS-1845 and album cover as the regular Straight Records release. Though perhaps seen as being an overlooked work in terms of later releases, Easy Action tracks \"Mr. & Misdemeanor\" and \"Refrigerator Heaven\" were both later included in the well-received compilation album The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper. \"Refrigerator Heaven\" was also included in the Warner Bros. compilation album Zapped, which showcased acts signed or produced by Frank Zappa. The closing track \"Lay Down And Die, Goodbye\", which was originally written and recorded as a single B-side by the band when it was called Nazz, begins with a sample of Tom Smothers saying \"You are the only censor; if you don't like what I'm saying, you have a choice: you can turn me off\". This is followed by an instrumental jam and finishes with the chorus from the demo. (The last part of the song is listed on the Science Fiction album as \"I've Written Home to Mother\", while the instrumental jam section is listed as \"For Alice\" or \"An Instrumental\"."

The limited release EP, \"Reigndance\" reached #1 on the Dutch Underground Singles chart. The name \"Hungry Lucy\" refers to a young woman named Lucy Ryan who died in 1792.

        "content": "Transition is an album of music by jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, recorded in 1965 but released posthumously only in 1970. As its title indicates, Transition was a bridge between classic quartet recordings like A Love Supreme and the more experimental works of Coltrane's last years. Coltrane's playing alternates between blues idioms and the free jazz that would dominate his final work. Of the four musicians on this album, pianist McCoy Tyner was still the most grounded in traditional jazz. Bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones were finding new ways to approach their instruments, while Coltrane took the lead with a newfound musical freedom. Transition'''s title track is a fifteen-minute modified blues, whilst \"Dear Lord\" is a ballad featuring Roy Haynes substituting for Jones on drums. \"Welcome,\" which replaces \"Dear Lord\" on the album's compact disc release, is a five-minute ballad with a theme pitched high in the tenor saxophone's altissimo register and making extensive use of multiphonics. The closing \"Suite\" is a twenty-minute performance, covering a variety of moods. \"Vigil\", which concludes the CD release of the album, is a fiery duet between Coltrane and Jones. Three months after this recording, Coltrane's quartet moved further into experimental territory with the album Sun Ship."

Born and raised in Nottingham, England, he was introduced to extreme music whilst playing in local bands, one of which being DIY punk band Scum Dribblurzzz, who never released any records or accepted payment for playing shows. In the mid-1980s, he founded Earache, and gradually began releasing records. He says the first year of business, 1986, was spent doing very little. He claims he initially set up the label as a way to continue to claim social security benefits without having to go to the unemployment office every two weeks, saying, \"I didn't fancy doing that\". He started releasing Flexi discs, and then moved on to putting out a split between Concrete Sox and Heresy, and an album by The Acc\u00fcsed. In 1987 he compiled two sessions by different line-ups of the band Napalm Death, and released them as the album Scum. The album proved popular, peaking at No. 7 on the UK Indie Chart and receiving airplay on John Peel's show on BBC Radio 1. Both Napalm Death and Heresy are considered to be pioneering grindcore bands. Pearson is responsible for signing many pioneering heavy bands including Bolt Thrower, Carcass, Cathedral, Godflesh, Anal Cunt, Entombed, Morbid Angel as well as Deicide, Mortiis, and The Berzerker, as well as releasing more techno-oriented music, and reissues of the label's earlier albums.

It was also Voivod's first album without original bassist Blacky, who had left the band before the release of the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful 1991 album Angel Rat. Uncomfortable with the idea of bringing in an immediate replacement for Blacky, Voivod opted to have session musician Pierre St-Jean play bass guitar for the recording of the album.

Included on the album also was the flipside for \"The Price Of Love\", \"It Only Costs A Dime\", a self-written piece. In December of that year, the final single \"It's All Over\" appeared, in an arrangement containing harpsichord and vocals. In a break from the usual routine, however, this song would feature Phil singing the principle vocal line and Don singing the harmony line a third lower. The song would later be covered by Cliff Richard. Revisiting their classic style of singing, they recorded the Sonny Curtis-written \"I Used To Love You\". Curtis, former member of The Crickets, had previously written another Everly Brothers hit single, \"Walk Right Back\". For the first 45 release of 1966, they visited the songwriting partnership of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, with a rendition of \"Glitter And Gold\". This arrangement, featuring fuzz guitar and harpsichord, was backed with another Brill Building number, the Howard Greenfield and Jack Keller-written \"Lovey Kravezit\". With hardly enough time to gauge the success of this single \"(You Got) The Power of Love\" (written by Delaney Bramlett and Joey Cooper), containing Motown influences aplenty and backed with \"Leave My Girl Alone\", was to hit the stores. Filling out the album, \"The Doll House Is Empty\" (later to become Warner Brothers single 5689 in February 1966), the mainstream-orientated \"(Why Am I) Chained To A Memory\"  (Edward A.

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in February 1979 in the United States by Capricorn Records and PolyGram Records elsewhere. The Allman Brothers Band had broken up in 1976 following internal turmoil, amplified by escalating drug use. The band members splintered into different acts \u2014 among those Great Southern, Sea Level, and the Gregg Allman Band. Guitarist Dickey Betts approached his bandmates in 1978 with the prospects of a reunion. After two former members declined to return, they added new members which made it the first to feature guitarist Dan Toler and bassist David Goldflies. Living together in Sarasota, Florida, they rehearsed and wrote the material for their next album in fall 1978. They began recording Enlightened Rogues that December, and recording stretched into the new year. Sessions took place in Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida with producer Tom Dowd, who worked on a trio of early Allman Brothers albums. The group stayed at a home overlooking Biscayne Bay, which promoted unity within the members. The recording process was smooth and pleasant, with members showing courtesy to one another in comparison to ill feelings felt earlier. The album's title comes from a quote original guitarist Duane Allman used to describe the band: \"The world is made of two great schools, enlightened rogues and religious fools.\" The album was a commercial success in the United States, peaking at #9 and earning a RIAA gold certification. \"Crazy Love\" was the group's second of three Top 40 hits, reaching #29. Despite this, Capricorn would file for bankruptcy that fall, leading the Allman Brothers to sign to Arista Records."

        "content": "The Deep was a short-lived American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods.  The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title. Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played. In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep. While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name. Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967. After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California."

They formed in Chapel Hill, NC, in March 1998 as a 'joke country band', a sort of counterweight to the hyped No Depression movement. Before long, however, both the \"joke\" and the \"country\" parts of the concept were eliminated, thus allowing the band to develop into a quirky alternative rock outfit. The Comas' respectable 1999 debut, Wave to Make Friends, was composed of sleepy (but not lethargic) indie pop and off-kilter boy-and-girl vocal harmonies, courtesy of co-founders Andrew Herod and Nicole Gehweiler. The band's instrumental canvas proved to be larger and more eclectic than that of the typical indie group, buoying the usual guitars and rhythm section with violin, organ, and creative non-rap samples. Faced with the challenge of labeling such music, the Comas' label billed deemed the sound \"stoner pop.\" In 2008, lead singer Andy Herod moved to Asheville, and formed a new project, called Electric Owls, which was signed to Vagrant Records. Electric Owls has produced two EPs and a full-length record titled 'Ain't Too Bright'. Assisting him in the studio were a few friends and former member Caperton."

Mute Records released the single in the UK under the title Moon & the Sky Plus, a similar tactic used for one of Erasure's previous singles (\"Rain\"). The song was written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell and is an uptempo, electronic dance track.  In its album version the song has a harsher, more techno-influenced feel.  Maverick Records, Erasure's U.S. record label at the time, requested the single remixes but ended up passing on the Loveboat album altogether and releasing Erasure from their contract, leaving Mute records to release the U.S. version of Loveboat in 2003. The extended track count and running time of Moon & the Sky Plus made it ineligible for the UK Singles Chart at the time.  A twelve-inch single, presented as a double A-side with a remix of Loveboat track  Perchance To Dream was also released.

This quasi-concept album was the first to be composed almost entirely of songs by a young Birmingham guitarist/singer named Jeff Lynne.  The LP came in a gatefold sleeve, the first of its kind since the Beatles' Sgt Pepper and the Rolling Stones'  Their Satanic Majesties Request albums. The inside sleeve art included a mock birthday feast attended by many British celebrities, including most of the Radio 1 disc jockeys, the Beatles, the Duke of Windsor, actor Warren Mitchell in his role as Alf Garnett, and group leader Jeff Lynne as an eight-year-old schoolboy. In the U.S. the cover art was different with a rather psychedelic-styled paisley pattern behind the band. While warmly received by critics, the record failed to chart in the U.K. or the U.S. The album was re-issued in 1976 by Liberty on their budget-price label Sunset, although in a non-gatefold sleeve with different design, to capitalise on Electric Light Orchestra's success.  A further re-issue came in 2014 by Parlophone, as the Liberty back catalogue had long since been acquired by EMI Records, for Record Store Day, in a limited edition on gold vinyl."

Rouse, who Cash later met during a show in Miami, Florida. Cash's recording is unusual in his repertoire for featuring a tenor saxophone solo by Boots Randolph, an instrument (and musician) rarely spotlighted on Cash's recordings. The album also contains three covers of Bob Dylan songs: \"It Ain't Me Babe\", \"Don't Think Twice, it's Alright\" and \"Mama, You've Been on My Mind\".

Cash had previously borrowed the melody of \"Don't Think Twice\" for his recording \"Understand Your Man.\" Released on February 1965, the album reached number three on the Billboard Country Albums chart as well as forty-nine on the Billboard 200.

        "content": "Forget What You Know  is the third and final studio album by American rock band Midtown. Following the release of Living Well Is the Best Revenge (2002), Midtown was moved from MCA to Geffen Records as a result of a merger between the two labels. The group spent time writing on their next album and following a meeting with Butch Walker, moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to start recording the new material. Walker headed the producing helm and Forget What You Know was recorded in late 2003 at Ruby Red Studios. The album is classified as an emo and pop punk release; its songs were compared with those of Division of Laura Lee, Recover and Jimmy Eat World. The release of Forget What You Know was announced in April 2004 and the band embarked on a US tour, during which \"Give It Up\" was released as a single, and a music video for the song was released after the tour finished. Forget What You Know was released on June 29, 2004, through Columbia Records; it reached number 109 on the Billboard 200 and \"Give It Up\" peaked at number 32 on the Alternative Songs radio chart. Music critics gave the album a mixed reception with some complimenting its energy and sound, and others finding it average. Midtown went on two other US tours and performed shows in Australia and the UK, and embarked upon another US tour in late 2004. A music video for \"Empty Like the Ocean\" was released in March 2005 and a headlining US tour and a stint on the Warped Tour followed."

Tom and his siblings use their middle names as stage surnames. After moving to London at age 19 to attend music college, he spent many years on the gig circuit before successful residencies at Bush Hall in Shepherds Bush and The Bedford, Balham brought him to the attention of record labels. A self-titled EP was released by Sony Music through the Columbia Records label in May 2004 and included the tracks \"Joanna\", \"Half a Man\" and \"My Declaration\". His debut album, Feather and Stone, was released by Columbia in October 2004 to critical acclaim, and was a regular on the BBC Radio 2 playlist.

It also reached No. 15 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart the week of July 2, 1983. At the time, it was the seventh Styx single to peak in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. According to Dennis DeYoung in a 2005 interview with classicrockrevisited.com, the track was originally slated as the first single from Kilroy Was Here until the staff at A&M suggested \"Mr. Roboto\". Despite the song's enormous success along with \"Show Me the Way\", \"Babe\" and \"The Best of Times\", it has not been performed live by the band since singer Dennis DeYoung was dismissed in 1999. DeYoung, however, still performs the song regularly on his solo tours."

It topped the United States Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart for seven non-consecutive weeks, her third successive number-one song. It was Selena's first number-one track on the US Regional Mexican Airplay chart, and became the most successful US Latin single of 1995.

Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund Bj\u00f8rklund, Beyonc\u00e9 and produced by Stargate and Beyonc\u00e9. \"Irreplaceable\" was originally a country record; it was re-arranged as a mid-tempo ballad with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyonc\u00e9 and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about female empowerment. Following the moderate chart performances of \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" and \"Ring the Alarm\", \"Irreplaceable\" was released internationally on October 13, 2006, as the album's second single, and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006.

It became Beyonc\u00e9's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been Mariah Carey in 2005. \"Irreplaceable\" also peaked at number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and New Zealand, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top twenty in several other European countries. \"Irreplaceable\" was the most successful song of 2007 in the US and 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6\u00a0million copies sold worldwide. It also was the most downloaded female ringtone of the 2000s decade in the US.

The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for \"Irreemplazable\", the Spanish version of the song.

His early releases including \"Just One More Time\" and \"Please Let Me In\", on the record labels Mickay and Ric-Tic, had relatively little success, but were subsequently picked up as Northern soul favorites in the UK. He was later signed to Motown Records, where he contributed as a songwriter but did not have any recordings released as a singer. Some of his Motown material has subsequently been released on the A Cellarful of Motown! compilation album series. His biggest hit single came in 1967 with \"Baby Please Come Back Home\" on the Groovesville label, which, like many of his records, he co-wrote.  The song reached No. 9 on the US Billboard R&B chart. However, subsequent singles on a variety of labels, including covers of \"Black Ivory\" on Today/Perception Records, failed to repeat the success. On the recommendation of his friend, Edwin Starr, Barnes moved to England in the 1970s, becoming popular. Starr had arranged for Barnes to appear on a series of shows, which led to him signing a deal with Contempo Records. He became a favorite artist of the UK Northern soul scene, and performed frequently in the UK. Early recordings from Barnes, such as \"Please Let Me In\" and \"Real Humdinger\", were re-released in the UK on the Tamla Motown label to cater for the buyers of Northern soul records. In the 1970s, Contempo Records released seven singles and an album, Sara Smile from Barnes, all without chart success. In the 1980s, he released five more records including a version of the Northern soul favorite by Frank Wilson, \"Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)\". and he recorded with producer Ian Levine in the 1990's. His song \"Chains of Love\", originally the B-side to his 1967 hit \"Baby Please Come Back Home\", achieved further renown when it was covered by the Dirtbombs on their Ultraglide in Black album in 2001."

The song was written by Madonna and Shep Pettibone, and was an unreleased demo from her Bedtime Stories (1994) studio sessions. Barlow came by the demo in 1997, while looking to record more songs for Open Road. He changed the lyrics to represent a male point of view rather than Madonna's, and recorded the track with Stephen Lipson as producer. Barlow was apprehensive about releasing the track, but due to contractual obligations he had to release it. The song became Barlow's second consecutive number-one release on the UK Singles Chart, following \"Forever Love\", and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also reached number one in Spain and the top ten in Denmark, Ireland, Italy, and Taiwan. A music video for the song was directed by Rocky Schenck and showed Barlow singing \"Love Won't Wait\" across different locations.

It was the band's final studio album, as they broke up on Halloween 2005. Contrary to the album's title, it is not a \"live\" album but rather a studio recording. Although the album received generally positive reviews, many consumers were confused by its title and assumed it to be a live album, which in fact it was not. The title was actually a reference to Camp X-Ray, the temporary detention facility located at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past. Cryptic liner notes written by Long Gone John seemed to indicate that the album was a \"last gasp\" of a band in turmoil and that it might be their final album. Touring in support of Live from Camp X-Ray was sparse due to the band members' commitments to other projects, and they would perform infrequently over the next few years. In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final performance on Halloween of that year. This confirmed suspicions that Live from Camp X-Ray was the band's final studio album, though posthumous releases of material recorded before their breakup have since been released. \"Bring Us Bullets\" is notable for being featured in the film Crank."

The album was written and produced by Chumbawamba (excluding a cover of the Bee Gees' \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\"), with additional production by Neil Ferguson. Originally a continuation of the sound of predecessor Tubthumper (1997), the group scrapped the material from the album's initial recording sessions and sought to explore new sounds with WYSIWYG. The album incorporates elements of pop, dance-pop, alternative rock, and experimental music. Thematically, the album explores various aspects of pop culture that the group had been exposed to due to the success of their 1997 single \"Tubthumping\". WYSIWYG was promoted with one single: \"She's Got All the Friends That Money Can Buy\". WYSIWYG received polarizing reviews from music critics. Some music critics praised the album's catchy hooks and references to pop culture, while others criticized the album for being dull and lacking cohesion. The album was met with some controversy due to the song \"Passenger List for Doomed Flight #1721\", a B-side to \"She's Got All the Friends That Money Can Buy\" and bonus track on the album, in which the group names off prominent public figures that they wish would disappear on an astray flight. In a stark contrast to Tubthumper, the album failed to attain any notable commercial success, failing to chart on any major music charts. Following the commercial failure of WYSIWYG, Chumbawamba parted ways with EMI in 2001."

        "content": "The Famous Flames were an American rhythm and blues vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown first began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first appearance professional recording, \"Please, Please, Please\", in 1956. On hit songs such as \"Try Me\", \"Bewildered\", \"Think\", \"I Don't Mind\", and \"I'll Go Crazy\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned singing, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show (1964) and Ski Party. Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown. On their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, they are described as \"a group of singers, performers and dancers that created the complementary elements of one of the greatest stage shows of all time.\" As of  2020, The Famous Flames were also inducted into The National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame. The Famous Flames are sometimes erroneously identified as James Brown's \"band\", a confusion partly fostered by their record companies' inconsistent labeling credit practices. Although members of the group did play instruments in some of their earliest shows and recordings, by 1959 Brown had hired a touring band and from that point on, the Flames contributed primarily as backing vocalists and dancers. The band was billed separately as the James Brown Band, and later as the James Brown Orchestra."

The album was recorded throughout two separate sessions in 2000. The first of these were conducted at the studio \"Rotund Rascal\" on Lankershim Blvd. in North Hollywood. This initial attempt at recording the entire album with Mark Trombino as engineer, ultimately resulted in only the completion of drums, bass, Alvin's guitars, and about half of Aaron's guitar tracks. In a bold move, the band fired Trombino, and resumed work over a month later with Alex Newport at Doug Messenger's Studio in North Hollywood, on Vineland Avenue. Having recorded albums such as At The Drive-In's  before at this same studio, Newport was comfortable in moving very quickly there with the band. The album, being recorded onto tape, as opposed to Pro Tools (as was customary for most bands of the time) resulted in the majority of the album being \"first takes\". The album was also mixed quickly by the band with Newport at Messenger's Studio. It was then mastered by Mark Chalecki in the Capitol Records building. Upon its eventual release, the album gave the band a significant push in popularity worldwide. It was included on many \"Best Albums of 2001\" lists in various publications. In support of the album, the band toured with The Dillinger Escape Plan, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Cave In, among many others. Alternative versions of the album were licensed and released by Sweet Nothing in Europe, Ugly Boy Records in Australia, and Victor in Japan. The Japanese CD release included \"Kill Cupid With A Nail File\" as a bonus track. Sweet Nothing issued two singles for the album in the UK. \"Feed A Cat To Your Cobra\" came first, and included tracks recorded at the band's first BBC John Peel radio session. Among these was a cover of The Stooges song, \"1970\". The second single, for \"Love Is Happiness\", included a re-recorded version of the song, as well as tracks recorded during the band's second BBC John Peel radio session. These recordings, along with a cover of the Spacemen 3 tune, \"Losing Touch With My Mind\", marked the appearance of the band's new drummer, Troy Petrey."

The album was credited on the front cover to \"Dean Elliott and His Swinging Big, Big Band\" and on the LP label to \"Dean Elliott and His Orchestra\".  The album was made with the assistance of Phil Kaye, a sound effects virtuoso who worked with Elliott on the Tom and Jerry cartoons. The subtitle that appeared on the front cover of the LP (which also featured three young women striking arguably sultry poses with saxophones and congas atop a cement truck) captured the basic goals, sound, and feel of the album quite well: A Sonic Spectacular Presenting MUSIC! MUSIC! MUSIC! With these special Percussion Effects! Cement Mixer, Air Compressor, Punching Bag, Hand Saw, Thunderstorm, Raindrops, Celery Stalks (the crunchiest), 1001 Clocks, Bowling Pins and Many Many More!! The LP is now firmly ensconced in the pantheon of \"space age pop\" or lounge classics, having been cited in RE/Search #14: Incredibly Strange Music (1993) which played a large part in the lounge revival of the 1990s.  A track from the album (\"Will You Still Be Mine\") was later anthologized on one of Rhino Records' influential Cocktail Mix CDs.  As the space age pop/lounge revival grew in popularity, two more tracks from the album (\"You're the Top\" and \"The Lonesome Road\") were anthologized on one of the many volumes of Capitol Records' Ultra-Lounge series. The album was out of print for many years and was not available officially on CD until recently.  A bootleg version is available as a single disc that combines Zounds! What Sounds! with Jack Fascinato's Music From A Surplus Store (1958), another orchestral album with sound effects from the same period with a similar flavor. Eclectic Dutch label Basta Music , known for their reissues of Raymond Scott material, have recently released what they describe as an official, legitimate CD release of Zounds! transferred directly from the Capitol master tapes."

Despite the strong music, their ironic lyrics seem flat without the punchlines.\" The Ottawa Citizen wrote that \"the arrangements here are carefully conceived and comparatively hook-laden.\" The Chicago Tribune judged it \"a sprightly little pop album,\" writing that the \"Philadelphia foursome is moving away from constant jokiness and concentrating more on melody and groove, even if it hasn't forsaken its tongue-in-cheek lyrics, amateurish vocals and unvarnished pep.\" The Gazette'' decided that the \"smartass Philly thrash-soul-punkers make the big time with a major-label album that finds all of the humor intact ... even if the punk part sounds more like a frat affectation now.\""

Influenced by groups such as The Smashing Pumpkins, The Beach Boys, My Bloody Valentine and The Cure, their music has also been compared by critics to Prefab Sprout, The Beautiful South and Deacon Blue.  The band initially signed a recording contract with At Large Records and released their debut single \"Frontline\" with that label in December 2005.  Soon after, the group signed to EMI Records and achieved minor success in 2006 with their singles \"Broke\" and \"Glorious\", which reached numbers 34 and 30 on the UK Singles Chart respectively.  Their Trevor Horn produced debut album, This Is Hazelville, was released on 14 August 2006 and reached number 23 on the UK Albums Chart. On 5 May 2008, Captain released \"Keep an Open Mind\" as the lead single from their forthcoming second album.  The second album, Distraction, had tentative release date of July 2008. But before it could be released, the band were dropped by EMI (along with many other acts on its roster) as a part of a restructuring plan, when the private equity firm Terrafirma purchased EMI. Captain never split up, but chose to work on other projects to keep their enthusiasm for music. Singer/guitarist Rik Flynn and drummer Reuben Humphries formed a new band called More Diamonds, while bassist Alex Yeoman and keyboardist/singer Clare Szembek went on to form the group Misdirectors. The band have discussed making a new record for some time but never had the opportunity due to many differing work commitments. The band plan to release a new album in 2012. Throughout 2012 and 2013, Captain recorded some tracks (for a third album) at Half-Ton Studios in Cambridge. In March 2014, Captain posted some videos of new songs (including a cover of The Lotus Eaters' 'The First Picture of You') on their Facebook page. Lead guitarist Mario Athanasiou died in early 2016."

Commercially, the single was a success, becoming on Estefan's fourteenth number-one song on the \"Hot Latin Songs\" chart, extending her record as the female artist with most number one hits on the chart. An accompanying music video was premiered to support the single; the song was also remixed to fit different formats, collaborations with some rappers were added, which included: Wisin & Yandel and Pitbull.

Born Gloria Jean Williamson in Detroit, Michigan in 1942, Williams auditioned for a spot in a girl group in 1957, and found herself accompanying Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Martha Reeves in the christened Del-Phis. The group performed in benefits and high school parties before being signed to the Chess Records subsidiary Checkmate (later bought by Motown Records), where the group recorded a single, \"I'll Let You Know\", with Williams on lead. Once at Motown, the group sang backing vocals for other acts/artists on studio recordings, such as Marvin Gaye during this period. Williams sang lead on an early single, \"There He Is (At My Door)\", on the Mel-O-Dy subsidiary of Motown after the group changed their name to The Vels. On the single's flip side, \"You'll Never Cherish A Love So True\", she shares the lead with Rosalind Ashford, who recorded a spoken part. However, when the single flopped, a frustrated Williams left the group leaving the band as a trio. The group went on to international fame with Reeves as lead singer under the name of Martha and the Vandellas. Williams died of diabetes complications in Detroit on July 5, 2000.  She was 57 years old."

        "content": "\"Paper Planes\" is a song written and recorded by British hip hop artist M.I.A. for her second studio album, Kala (2007). Produced and co-written by her and Diplo, the song features an interpolation of English rock band the Clash's 1982 song \"Straight to Hell\", leading to its members being credited as co-writers. A downtempo alternative hip hop track combining African folk music elements, the song has a less dance-oriented sound compared to other songs on the album. Its lyrics, inspired by M.I.A.'s own problems obtaining a visa to work in the US, satirise American perceptions of immigrants from Third World nations. \"Paper Planes\" was released in February 2008 as the album's third single by XL Recordings in Europe and Interscope Records in the US. The accompanying music video, filmed in Bedford-Stuyvesant, depicts M.I.A. as an undercover dealer and features images of paper planes flying overhead. While the video proved popular on MTV, the network censored the song's cannabis reference and gunshot sounds, which disappointed M.I.A. The song was M.I.A.'s biggest commercial success, entering the top 20 on charts in several countries including Denmark and the UK. It peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming M.I.A.\u2019s first and only song to chart in the US top 100 as a lead artist. The song was certified multi-platinum in Canada and the US, platinum in the UK and gold in New Zealand. The unexpected success of \"Paper Planes\" paralleling M.I.A.'s condemnations of the Sri Lankan government's acts of genocide against the Tamils, with whom M.I.A. shares ethnic and cultural backgrounds, generated accusations of her supporting terrorism. The song received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics, who complimented its musical direction and the subversive, unconventional subject matter. It won awards from the Canadian Independent Music Awards and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and earned a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year. The song has received praise in publications such as NME, Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, each naming it among either the best songs of the 2000s decade or of all time."

Jaye grew up on a sharecropper's farm and did a stint in the Navy from 1954 to 1958. After his return he started a band with bassist Tommy Baker and drummer Carl Frye, who began playing the local Arkansas circuits. In 1966, the group traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, and recorded a single, \"My Girl Josephine\" (a hit for Fats Domino the previous decade). The single was initially released in a press run of 500; Jaye shopped the disc to local radio stations, and as the tune began getting airplay, Jaye signed a contract with Hi Records for national distribution. Re-released in 1967, \"My Girl Josephine\" became a hit single in the US, peaking at No.\u00a029 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. A full-length LP, My Girl Josephine, followed, which hit No.\u00a0195 in the US, but four further singles from the album failed to make an impact on the charts. During this time Jaye toured with Booker T and the MGs and Lou Rawls among others. Jaye left Hi Records in 1970 and began recording new material for Nashville's Mega/Raintree. Seven singles were released, some of which found regional success. Between 1974 and 1975 he sang lead with the Bill Black Combo after its founder's death. In 1975, Jaye signed with Columbia Records, first releasing a cover of Tommy Edwards's \"It's All in the Game\". This was followed by two further US Country hits (again with Hi Records) in 1976, \"Honky Tonk Women Love Redneck Men\" (US Country No.\u00a032) and \"Hot and Still Heatin' (US Country No.\u00a078). In 1979 he left Hi again, and began touring the American South with his wife Darlene Battles. Together they released an album on Bejay Records in 1984. Jaye toured Sweden and England in the 1990s, and released another album, One More Time, in 2005."

While considered by most fans to be their strongest effort, the album was largely ignored by the general public in the midst of the popularity of grunge rock in 1992, peaking at number 72 on the UK Albums Chart. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett praises the album as a \"multifaceted, deeply felt hour of music that is easily the equal of such similar masterpieces of post-punk guitar rock as The Chameleons' Script of the Bridge and The Sound's Heads and Hearts.\" Lead singer Patrick Fitzgerald said this of the album:"

As the founder of influential protopunk band The Modern Lovers, Richman had strived to convey authentic emotions and storytelling with his music. I, Jonathan continued this aesthetic with simple and sparse rock and roll arrangements, and straightforward lyrics about mundane topics. Songs on the album addressed topics such as backyard parties (\"Parties in the U.S.A\"), memories of neighborhoods in which Richman had lived (\"Rooming House on Venice Beach\" and \"Twilight in Boston\") and his admiration of his primary musical inspiration, the Velvet Underground (\"Velvet Underground\").  The latter song includes a brief interlude of the Velvet Underground song, \"Sister Ray\". The album helped increase Richman's cultural profile, which would include a 1993 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien during which Richman performed one of the album's songs, \"I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar.\""

The Weatherfords were formed by husband and wife Earl Weatherford and Lily Weatherford, who began singing together in the mid-1940s in Long Beach, California, after their marriage in 1944. Earl had founded the group prior to this as an all-male troupe, and Lily began filling in on the tenor parts in 1948, eventually becoming the group's most visible member. They moved several times over the next few decades, to Fort Wayne, Indiana, Akron, Ohio, Fontana and Sacramento, California (as part of the staff of Calvary Temple), and Paoli, Oklahoma. The group sang on California radio stations (KFOX- KBGR-KBIG ) in the 1940s, and was offered a full-time spot on radio station WOWO in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1949. In the 1950s, they recorded for RCA Victor. In 1959, The quartet's In The Garden album for RCA was produced by Chet Atkins, and also featured guitar work by Atkins. It was recorded in Nashville at RCAs Studio B. They also worked in collaboration with evangelist Rex Humbard between 1953 and 1963. The group's other key members at this time were Glen Payne, Armond Morales, and Henry Slaughter. The Weatherfords departed Akron, Ohio, for California in 1963, and the groups The Cathedrals and The Imperials were formed from members of the Weatherfords at this time as well. Other notable members included Dallas Holm, whose time with the group was short due to his draft requirements during the Vietnam War; Jim Hammel, who went on to be a long-time member of the Kingmens Quartet; David Engles, who now owns and operates a radio network out of Tulsa, Oklahoma (KNYD); and Dave Roland (Dave & Sugar). The Weatherfords were featured on Greystone Productions: The History Of Southern Gospel Music, that was featured on many PBS stations in the mid 1990s, as well as several of the early editions of the Gaither Homecoming Videos. Earl Weatherford died in 1992. In 1999, Lily published an autobiography, With All My Heart. She performed with the Weatherfords and retired in June 2013. Earl and Lily Weatherford were inducted into the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame in 2000. Steve Weatherford is still touring nationally doing upwards of 150 concerts per year."

It was composed by Miracles lead singer, William \"Smokey\" Robinson, produced by Robinson and Terry \"Buzzy\" Johnson, and was taken from their album, One Dozen Roses. This song was actually the follow-up hit to their #1 smash, \"The Tears of a Clown\", and reached the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, charting at #18, and the Top 10 of the Billboard R&B chart, peaking at #7. It was also a Top 20 hit in the UK, reaching #11 on the British charts that year. It is also noted as the group's last Top 20 pop hit before Smokey Robinson's departure from The Miracles the following year, and was performed by the group on Dick Clark's American Bandstand on an episode dated July 10, 1971. The song is a sad, mournful tune that belies its up-tempo nature, Smokey, as the song's narrator, tells a girl that he obviously wants (who does not reciprocate his feelings) that he doesn't blame her for \"playing it cool\" when she decides to call off the relationship. Lamenting the fact that his attraction to her covered the fact that she had just casual feelings for him, he sings: \"I Don't Blame You At All\" was the group's final big hit with Robinson, though the Miracles did continue to chart several times before his departure, with songs including \"Satisfaction\", \"I Can't Stand To See You Cry\", and \"We've Come Too Far to End It Now\". This song has inspired a cover version by Rosetta Hightower, and appears on many Miracles' \"Greatest Hits\" album and CD compilations."

The band is known for alternating lead singer duties. Their sound has been described as \"classic '60s pop, '90s alternative, and contemporary indie-rock clashing fluidly to create a strangely nostalgic effect.\" The band self-released their debut album, \"When The Madhouses Appear,\" on Lady Monk Records (the band's own imprint), in late 2010, after which they toured alongside Delta Spirit and Darker My Love. The critically lauded self-released album earned them a deal with Dangerbird Records, who re-released the album in early 2011, as well as sessions on World Cafe and with KCRW's Nic Harcourt.  A 7-song EP \"What I've Seen,\" was released in November 2011 and followed by a ten-week national tour. The band is currently working on its second full-length record and taking the process into their own hands and raising money directly through fans without the influence of a label. The song \"Out of My Head\", from the album \"When the Madhouses Appear,\" (2010) was featured in the end credits of the American comedy-drama series Orange is the New Black, in the 4th episode of the 4th season, titled \"Doctor Psycho\"."

The album's release was preceded by the departure of the group's longest-standing member Carmit Bachar. Development began in February 2008 where the group worked with previous collaborators Sean Garrett, Polow da Don and Timbaland and new ones such as Darkchild, J-Roc and Chase N Cashe. Polow da Don, R. Kelly and Snoop Dogg also make guest performances on the album. Several songs on Doll Domination were originally recorded for the lead singer Nicole Scherzinger's debut solo album, Her Name is Nicole, which was shelved after the under-performance of its preceding singles. The album consists of a mixture of pop and R&B songs that also blend elements of dance, electropop with lyrics that tackle fame, sexuality and relationships. All of the lead and background vocals were sung by Scherzinger with support from Melody Thornton, whilst the remaining group members are only credited for background vocals. Upon release, Doll Domination received mixed reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 becoming the group's highest charting album. It experienced similar peaks in international territories, debuting at number three in Canada and number four in Australia and the United Kingdom. Doll Domination was later reissued in multiple versions throughout 2009. The album was supported with a world tour titled Doll Domination Tour in 2009. The album was preceded by the release of the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single \"When I Grow Up\" and the UK top-ten hit \"Whatcha Think About That\" (featuring Missy Elliott). Other successful singles were \"I Hate This Part\", \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\", and \"Hush Hush; Hush Hush\", all of which reached the top ten in numerous countries worldwide. Although \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\" became a number-one hit in Australia, Ireland, Finland, among other countries, the single caused tension on the group as Scherzinger was billed as a featured artist. Despite their commercial success, unhappiness of Scherzinger's spotlight and prominence within the group grew leading to a public outburst by Thornton during the tour. In early 2010, the group disbanded to pursue solo projects, before reforming in 2019 with the promise of new music. In 2019, Doll Domination was re-released, excluding the R. Kelly collaboration \"Out of This Club\" following the airing of the Surviving R. Kelly documentary and subsequent abuse allegations against the singer."

        "content": "Destiny is the sixth studio album by American R&B/funk singer Chaka Khan, released on Warner Bros. Records in 1986. Destiny was Khan's follow-up to the platinum-selling I Feel for You and was as high tech as its predecessor\u2014symptomatically and characteristically for its period with more producers and sound engineers credited in the liner notes than musicians\u2014but was musically more geared towards rock and pop than soul and R&B, most prominently on tracks such as \"So Close\", the self-penned title track \"My Destiny\", \"Who's It Gonna Be\" and \"Watching the World\" featuring Phil Collins on drums and backing vocals. The album spun off five single releases, the first being \"Love of a Lifetime\", co-written, co-produced and featuring backing vocals by Green Gartside of British band Scritti Politti (US Pop #53, US R&B #21, UK #52). The second single \"Tight Fit\" was a midtempo R&B ballad, just like \"Eye to Eye\" from I Feel for You produced by Russ Titelman, which reached #28 on the US R&B chart. The satirical \"Earth to Mickey\" (When are you going to land?), featuring Khan both singing and rapping (and keyboardist Reggie Griffin rapping in the role of 'Mickey'), was released as the third single in early 1987 and only just made the Top 100 of the R&B chart, peaking at #93. The dramatic ballad \"The Other Side of the World\", written by Mike Rutherford of Genesis and B. A. Robertson and which had first been released as part of the White Nights soundtrack album in late 1985, reached #81. The fifth single \"Watching the World\" never charted. The album itself fared slightly better, reaching #25 on Billboards R&B albums chart, but stalling at #67 on Pop and #77 in the UK. Destiny however gave Khan another Grammy nomination in 1987 for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female. The track \"My Destiny\" was used as the theme song for Richard Pryor's motion picture Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling. The closing track, the heavily edited one minute thirty-nine seconds \"Coltrane Dreams\", a tribute to John Coltrane, had a backing track mainly made up of samples of Khan's voice. The actual full-length version of the track (4:54) was only released as the B-side of the 12\" single \"Love of a Lifetime\". \"Love of a Lifetime\", \"Tight Fit\", \"Earth to Mickey\" and \"Watching the World\" were all released as 12\" singles including extended remixes. While the success of Khan's own single releases in 1986 was limited to the R&B charts, she appeared as featured vocalist/vocal arranger on two worldwide pop/rock chart hits that same year, Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" and Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\"; on the latter she was only credited for 'vocal arrangement' in the liner notes. The song was originally recorded with Khan sharing lead vocals with Palmer but due to contractual problems between Warner Bros. Records and Island Records her own vocals were removed from the final mix."

The album's lead-off single, \"Another Perfect Day\", peaked at No.\u00a045 on the Billboard country charts. Country Standard Time gave the album a mixed review, stating that although Gowan and Weldon were \"indistinguishable vocally and equally malleable\", and although some of the songs were derivative of the Eagles, the more up-tempo tracks were \"punch[ed] up... with timeless Texas kick\". After releasing this album, they charted two more singles (\"The Wish\" and \"Amnesia\"), the latter of which was not included on an album. By 1999, Blake & Brian had parted ways. Gowan released a solo album entitled Warm Spanish Wine in 2000. He also co-wrote Rodney Atkins' 1997 debut single \"In a Heartbeat\" and three songs on Atkins' 2003 debut album Honesty."

It was released on November 24, 2008, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West recorded the album during September and October 2008 at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii, with the help of producers No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, and others. The sessions also featured guest appearances by vocalists such as Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, Mr Hudson, and Lil Wayne. Conceived in the wake of several distressing personal events for West, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and vocals sung through an Auto-Tune processor. The production also abandons conventional hip hop sounds in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, with prominent use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine. West's lyrics on the album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, inspired by the breakup with his fianc\u00e9e, his struggles with pop stardom, and the death of his mother. 808s & Heartbreak debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling just over 450,000 copies in its first week. Despite varying responses from listeners, the album received positive reviews from most music critics, who generally commended West's experimentation, and was named one of 2008's best records in several year-end lists. Four singles were released in promotion, including the hit singles \"Love Lockdown\", which became West's highest Billboard Hot 100 debut of his career, and \"Heartless\". Despite its positive critical reception, the album was largely overlooked as a contender for the 52nd Grammy Awards, although the single \"Amazing\" received a nomination in the category of Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. In the years since its release, 808s & Heartbreak has since been cited as a prominent influence on subsequent hip hop, pop, and R&B music, pioneering emo rap and experimental R&B developments in particular. This was due to a new wave of rappers, singers, and producers coming to adopt aspects of its style and thematic content. Rolling Stone included 808s & Heartbreak in its list of \"The 40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time\" and ranked it number 244 on its revision to the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. By 2013, the album had sold 1.7 million copies in the United States, and was certified triple platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020."

        "content": "\"When Love Takes Over\" is a song by French record producer David Guetta with vocals by American singer Kelly Rowland, from Guetta's fourth studio album, One Love. It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo. According to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro mixed the song, focussing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Take Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, and the piano melody resembles that of Coldplay's 2002 hit single \"Clocks.\" \"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest-charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on Billboards Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, Billboard named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release. In the song's accompanying music video, Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual Miss Universe competition. The single earned seven Platinum certifications as well as five Gold certificates, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide. Additionally, it earned Guetta two Grammy Award nominations for \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\"."

        "content": "Petula is a 1968 Pye Records album release by Petula Clark leased to Warner Bros. in the USA. The two albums precedent to Petula: These Are My Songs and The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener had been primarily produced by Sonny Burke with Tony Hatch, the producer/songwriter who'd established Clark as a top recording star in 1964, contributing only one track to each album. With Petula Hatch again became Clark's exclusive producer overseeing all the album's tracks. Petula would prove to be the last Petula Clark album of original material produced by Hatch. The first advance single from Petula: the Les Reed/Barry Mason composition \"Kiss Me Goodbye\" had reached #15 US in April 1968, becoming the first hit single for Clark produced but not written by Hatch. Of the eleven additional tracks which would comprise Petula, seven were written by Hatch and Jackie Trent. Hatch also had Clark cover \"Days\", \"The Good Life\" and \"This Girl's in Love with You\" and recorded Clark singing \"Why Can't I Cry\" which had been written by arranger Johnny Harris and wife Kim Clark. The song was also recorded by Tom Jones. The Hatch/Trent composition \"Don't Give Up\" - described by Hatch as a homage to \"Can't Take My Eyes off You\" - was released as the album's second advance single in July 1968 and failed to sustain Clark's Top 20 comeback peaking at #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Clark's final US Top 40 hit.2 \"Billboard\" reported that \"Don't Give Up\" was one of the most requested tunes at Las Vegas' Desert Inn Sky Room as of late 1968 and early 1969. Singer-pianist Murray Arnold claimed it was behind only \"Didn't We\" and \"Little Green Apples.\" The track \"Have Another Dream On Me\" was referred to as \"my latest\" by Clark on her April 1968 NBC TV special. For reasons unclear, the song never came out on single, but \"Don't Give Up\" did. Petula rose significantly higher on the US album charts than the preceding The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener reaching #51 as opposed to #93. Clark's UK label Pye Records released the album in the UK and Ireland (cat# NPL 18235) and also in New Zealand (cat# NSPL 18235). In France the Petula album was issued by Vogue Records with cat# CLD 723. 1The titles of the singles \"Kiss Me Goodbye\" and \"Don't Give Up\" were displayed with the name \"Petula\" on the album's cover but the official title of the album is simply Petula. 2\"Don't Give Up\" ranked in the Top 30 in both Cash Box and Record World with respective peaks of #27 and #23. The track reached #5 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart."

Woods was born in Looxahoma, Mississippi, a small town just west of Mississippi Highway 35. His harmonica playing first gained attention in the 1960s, when he was a duet partner with the guitarist and singer Mississippi Fred McDowell. They recorded together for the music historian George Mitchell in 1967, for Chris Strachwitz's Arhoolie Records (King of the Country Blues Vol. 2), for Swingmaster (Blues of Johnny Woods) and as a solo for Tom Pomposello and Fred Seibert of Oblivion Records (\"Mississippi Harmonica\") in 1972. Stylistically, Woods's music sprang from the same north Mississippi fife-and-drum blues tradition as McDowell's. However, personal problems kept him rooted in the Delta, primarily working as a farmhand and sharecropper. After McDowell's death in July 1973, Woods faded into obscurity until George Mitchell paired him again with another Mitchell discovery from the Mississippi Delta, R. L. Burnside, himself a McDowell disciple. They recorded the Swingmaster album and video Going Down South. Woods died in Olive Branch, Mississippi, in 1990."

The duo achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize Southern hip hop while experimenting with diverse genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and techno. Benjamin and Patton formed the group as high school students in 1992. Outkast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single \"Player's Ball\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed Stankonia, which included the singles \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"B.O.B.\" In September 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles \"Hey Ya!\" and \"The Way You Move.\" The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Priest, and drummer Jim Bashaw. In 1985, Billy Dior replaced Bashaw and the band relocated to Los Angeles, California to pursue a recording contract. Priest was still under contract with his other band Diamond Rexx, and could not follow the band there and was replaced by another guitarist, Sean Freehill. Priest rejoined the band in 1986, after they signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records. The video for \"777\" received some airplay on MTV, but album sales failed to prosper. In 1990, the band released their second album, Warped, but their singer quit before the promotion campaign got off the ground.  The group disbanded shortly thereafter and did not release another album until 1996, when Delinquent Records featured the group's third and final album, Beyond D'Valley Of D'Molls, which featured three live tracks as well as previously unreleased studio recordings.  There also exists a best of, compilation CD, The Best of Everything, which came out in 2007. Billy Dior was reportedly in the bands Kid Rocker, and the Screamin' Mimis with future Poison guitarist C.C. Deville, prior to joining D'Molls. In 2015, Dior sued Poison for copyright infringement on several Poison hit songs, including, \"Talk Dirty To Me,\" for which the band failed to credit him as co-writer.  Poison ultimately settled with Dior out of court for an undeclared sum. He went on to publish a thriller novel in 2004 under his birth name, Billy McCarthy, The Devil of Shakespeare, inspired in part by his experiences with the band and the 1980s Los Angeles glam rock scene.  In 2017, McCarthy published his sophomore effort at writing, Beat Me Till I'm Famous, an autobiographical memoir of his rags to rags experience as a professional musician in the 1980s, most of which covers the entire D'Molls story. In 2018, D'Molls 1988 debut album was remastered and re-released on Rock Candy Records."

It was released on September 6, 2010, by the independent record label Plug Research, his first album for the label. Bilal began composing music for the album using the recording software GarageBand, while touring in the aftermath of his unreleased but widely leaked album Love for Sale. He wrote and recorded Airtight's Revenge during a period of approximately three years, working alongside the musician-producers Steve McKie, Nottz, Shafiq Husayn, Conley \"Tone\" Whitfield, and 88-Keys. The album's soul and rock music is more electronic- and guitar-oriented than Bilal's previous albums, featuring influences from jazz, blues, and futurism. Experiences from his personal life and professional conflicts with his former label, Interscope Records, formed the inspiration for the album's dark songwriting, which explores themes of love, spirituality, capitalism, and politics, with lyrics informed by free thought. The album debuted at number 106 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 4,600 copies in its first week. Although it charted modestly, Airtight's Revenge was well received by music critics upon its release. PopMatters ranked the album number 61 in its year-end list of best albums for 2010, calling it a \"wildly inventive, wildly enjoyable album\"."

Recorded in 1995, it had been intended for release on James' own label, Rephlex Records, under his alias AFX, as the fifth installment in his Analogue Bubblebath series. The EP would have consisted of nine tracks, in alternating acid house/techno and ambient styles. However, Richard decided that it was not up to par with the others in the series, so only a handful of vinyl test pressings were made. In January 2005 Rephlex mailed out black vinyl/binder editions of Analord 10. Due to problems at the manufacturing/mail out stage, approximately 20 buyers did not receive their package. Rephlex mailed out a second batch in June 2005 to those who had not received their order. This second batch included a free copy of Analogue Bubblebath 5. This distribution of Analogue Bubblebath 5 was unannounced. No information is printed on the record's blank white labels (although some copies do have \"AB5\" written and circled onto them), but the identifying call number of 'CAT 034' has been etched into its run-out grooves. However, there are no plans of a commercial release for this album. James later uploaded an alternate mix of track 2 on SoundCloud as \"21 Hapshifter1\"."

The release was supported with the release of its first single, \"Limit to Your Love\", on 28 November 2010. The album was released to widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for the 2011 Mercury Prize. A deluxe edition was released on 10 October 2011 with different artwork and bundled with a second disc, Blake's then-new EP Enough Thunder, which was also released separately. BackgroundJames Blake builds on the material released by Blake as three EPs in 2010: The Bells Sketch, CMYK and Klavierwerke. All three EPs have differing musical styles. Mike Powell of online music magazine Pitchfork noted it was \"amazing\" that so much material could be released in such a short period of time. However, despite the amount of music released by Blake in 2010, most of the material on his debut album is completely new. In interviews about the album, Blake cited fellow Londoners the xx as an influence, telling Clashs Robin Murray their success with debut xx \"made it a lot easier for me\". He added that the band's acclaim meant listeners \"are gonna be a lot less shocked by [this album]\". Blake, speaking to Jo Youle and Mark Savage of the BBC, said that a lot of the vocals on the album were by him, despite relying more heavily on samples in previous work. \"There are times when it might seem there's a sample being used, but I've just sampled myself. That's what makes this record special compared to everything [else] I've done.\" Before the album's release, Blake was named in both BBC's \"Sound of 2011\" shortlist, and came second to Jessie J in the running for the BRIT Awards' Critics' Choice Award."

Amos is also a multi-instrumentalist for groups such as Grails and Om and Lilacs & Champagne. Amos was born of the lo-fi home recording movement of the '80s and early '90s. Amos described the mission of his music as \"facing your personal reality\". Amos said in an interview that, beginning at age 16, he used drugs every single day and did not let up for years. A music critic for The Guardian described him as a prolific songwriter and as having a \"great voice\". Reviewer Rob Cullivan of the Portland Tribune described Holy Sons' album Survivalist Tales to be an \"ode to the dime novels in the early 1900s that peddled the stories of wilderness explorers,\" and described the music as \"sonic wanderings\" with \"strange song structures\". A review in the Portland Mercury described his music as \"dark, languid psychedelia\" and commented how Amos has \"habitually been kept underground\" with few live performances up until the last few years. His vocals have been compared to Neil Young but change personalities quite often. Willamette Week described the album Decline of the West as \"a varied, meticulously constructed piece of avant-folk that stands alone by its own merits.\""

Regarding the album's concept, she has described it as the exploration of \"the hunter and the hunted and how both exist within us\" through the story of \"a woman who finds herself in the dying embers of a relationship.\" Night of Hunters is Amos's first studio album recorded using only acoustic instruments, relying solely on her vocals and classically trained piano skills, along with a variety of accompanying string and woodwind instruments, to create its classical sound. Additionally, to record this album Amos broke a nearly 15-year-long collaboration with her studio and touring bandmates, choosing to work with a variety of new musicians, including the Berlin Philharmonic's principal clarinetist, Andreas Ottensamer, and the award-winning string quartet, Apollon Musag\u00e8te, while enlisting her daughter, Natashya Hawley, and niece, Kelsey Dobyns, as guest vocalists. Night of Hunters also marks the twentieth anniversary of her long-time collaboration with John Philip Shenale, who has contributed arrangements to most of her albums, beginning with her solo debut, Little Earthquakes (1992). The album is Amos' first release on a classical music label. Like her previous releases, it is available in both standard and deluxe CD formats, digital format, as well as limited edition vinyl. Amos also released an entirely instrumental version of the album entitled Night of Hunters \u2013 Sin Palabras (without words) available only to download.

The album is Lewis' first under RCA Records after parent company Sony Music Entertainment closed J Records and relocated its artists. Glassheart was conceived in 2010 shortly after the completion of Lewis' first headline tour, The Labyrinth. Recording and production took place in Denver, Los Angeles and London; originally the album was due for release in November 2011 but was pushed back several times to accommodate new recording sessions and allow more creative time. The album was the first \u2013 and so far only \u2013 of Lewis' albums not released in North America. On Glassheart, Lewis reunites with Ryan Tedder, record producer of her previous singles \"Bleeding Love\" and \"Happy\" and songwriter Andrea Martin who co-wrote \"Better in Time\", in addition to a number of new collaborators such as British duo Naughty Boy and Emeli Sand\u00e9, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and DJ Frank E. Producer Fraser T Smith executive produced the album after impressing Lewis with his work on Hurt: The EP (2011), a cover song extended play (EP) that Lewis released to bridge the gap between Echo (2009) and Glassheart. \"Collide\", a collaboration with house music DJ Avicii, was released on 2 September 2011. Originally a song by just Lewis, Avicii sued Sony Music claiming that the song plagiarised his own instrumental \"Penguin\". Through mutual agreement it was released as a collaboration, becoming a top-five hit in the UK and Lewis' first to top the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The Afrojack remix of \"Collide\" is the only version to feature on Glassheart. Subsequent singles \"Trouble\" featuring American rapper Childish Gambino and \"Lovebird\" were less successful, the former reaching the top ten in the UK and top thirty in Ireland, while the latter sold fewer than 600\u00a0copies in the UK and failed to chart anywhere in Europe. Glassheart received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the vocals and experimental use of dubstep and electronic music but were less impressed with the album's many ballads. In the UK, the album was Lewis' first album not to reach number one, debuting at number three with 27,000\u00a0copies in its first week. Elsewhere the album became Lewis' third top-five album in Ireland, and upon its international release in November 2012, reached the top thirty in some of continental Europe. Following a 2013 release for Austria and Germany, Glassheart peaked at number five and six respectively, outperforming previous album Echo. In April 2013, Lewis embarked on the Glassheart Tour, in support of the album, visiting Switzerland, Germany and the UK."

The album was a follow-up to the Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record, which was released in 1974. The tape is however a completely different album consisting of new material. The album was conceived and written by National Lampoon contributing editor Ed Subitzky. The designer and writer for the wrapper (which was a spoof of consumer advertising) was Tibor Kalman, at M& co studio, and the sound designer for the album itself was Bob Pomann. The album was directed by Maurice Peterson, who also cast the album, and voice-acted several parts: a person with whiplash, a truck driver and a hobo. The cassette is the main item in the Official National Lampoon Stereo Test & Demonstration Kit, which also includes a faux leather \"travel case\", cotton swabs, and a small bottle of cleaner fluid (for cleaning the heads on a cassette deck). The album is a parody of stereo test and demonstration records, which were used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test the performance of their audio systems. All of the items recorded on the tape are comedy sketches; the majority of them are also functional car stereo tests. One sketch is an old-fashioned country music song of love lost, where the lyrics use tones that vary from 30 cycles per second (now known as the hertz) up to 15,000 cycles per second. Another sketch explains to the consumer how to play a trick on passengers in the car by using the left and right, as well as front and back, speaker volume controls to make it appear that fart noises are emanating from one particular area inside the car. Other comedy sketches help determine if a unit is in phase or out of phase, and whether a system has good left-right separation. The effects of interference noise and poor reception on car stereos are also demonstrated in comic ways. An advertisement for the Official National Lampoon Car Stereo Test and Demonstration Tape ran in the July 1980 issue of National Lampoon magazine."

        "content": "Hamza Namira () is an Egyptian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He has released three albums from the production of Awakening Records: Dream With Me, Insan, Esmaani; and a couple of albums from Namira production, his own foundation: Hateer Min Tany and Mawlood Sanat 80. Besides singing, for which he is mostly known, he has also worked in musical composition and arrangement. Hamza composed some of his own work, like the album heads Esmaani and Insan, along with some collaborations with other artists, like Maher Zain's song Ya Nabi Salam Alayka. He also contributed to arranging the cartoony remake Egyptian Jingle Bells (also known as Oh la la song), which was the first shaabi work in his repertoire, later followed by Esta3izo in his fourth studio album. Hamza's work is mostly marked by a recurring sociopolitical theme, diverting from love songs and focusing on topics of general humanist interest, like hope, alienation, generational change, and oppression. He's also interested in reviving cultural heritage. Having been dubbed \"Voice of the Revolution\", works of Hamza rose to prominence during the 25 January revolution, in which he personally participated, and were considered a symbolic figure thereof. Dari Ya Alby, from his third album, topped the SoundCloud chart for almost a month."

Produced by Ed Ackerson and the band themselves, the album was released on June 12, 2012, in the United States by Epitaph Records and the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. Previously, the group had released their major-label debut, My Dinosaur Life (2010) on Columbia; the band parted ways with the label due to the record's lackluster commercial response. Following this, the band returned to their home of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with producer and longtime friend Ackerson. The band entered a local studio and recorded their next effort on their own time and finances. The band recorded Go without a label, and put it upon themselves to pay for mixing and mastering and have conversations with distributors later. Frontman Justin Pierre composed the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, and learning to live in the moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013. Go received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, and peaked at number eight on Billboard Independent Albums chart. \"True Romance\" was the album's lead single, and featured a one-shot music video reminiscent of the works of Spike Jonze."

Production on the album was chiefly handled by Peter Ries, while Stephen Lipson and Pete Martin contributed additional tracks. Songs were penned by J\u00f6rgen Elofsson, Toby Gad, Yak Bondy, Sheppard Solomon, Jade Anderson and Greg Wells among others. Initially scheduled for a 2003 release, the album garnered a generally mixed reception from music critics upon its release and peaked at number 15 on the German Albums Chart. With a domestic sales total of 40,000 copies, it widely failed to satisfy the label's commercial expectations, resulting in the termination of Schoppmann's contract with the record company only four months after its release.

Written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher and produced by Lotti Golden, Richard Scher, and John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, the song appears on the group's debut album It's a Beat Wave (Prism Records)  charting on the Billboard R&B and dance charts. Described as \"the perfect instance of hip hop's contemporary ramifications,\" Warp 9's second record exemplifies the afrofuturist influence in hip hop, \"born of a science fiction revival.\" The UK media outlet, the Guardian, on May 14, 2014, described \"Light Years Away\" as a \"cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism.\" \"Light Years Away\" a sci-fi tale of ancient alien visitation, partially inspired by \"The Message\", also pays homage to  Sun Ra's film Space Is the Place. Music journalist Rob Fitzpatrick characterizes \"Light Years Away\" as a cut above: \"this new track was something else, a brilliantly spare and sparse piece of electro hip-hop, LYA traversed inner and outer space, matching rolling congas with vocoder voices and the hiss and sizzle of cutting edge synth and drum machine technology.\" The rhyme in \"Light Years Away\" invokes a stark, cyberpunk Philip K. Dickian vision of the future. Newsweek highlighted the song's experimental use of vocoders and sci-fi street imagery in \"Language Arts & Disciplines: Sci-Fi Street Sounds.\" The 12\" recording employed other innovative features for its time, such as incorporating both singing and rapping, a feminist rap by Ada Dyre, live Latin percussion overdubs in combination with Roland TR-808 beats, and a unique take on the snare (backbeat). The snare is syncopated so that the backbeat arrives a 1/16th note early on the second beat of each bar; the fourth beat is not syncopated."
