Released in late 1969 by Pye Records, it contained material very different from that which pop-lovers were accustomed to hearing from Shaw. This was Shaw's first time producing an album herself and she chose to cover songs made popular by more alternative artists who she felt had had a big impact on the music of the 1960s."

        "content": "The Famous Flames were an American rhythm and blues, soul vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown first began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first appearance in a professional recording, \"Please, Please, Please\", in 1956.\nOn hit songs such as \"Try Me\", \"Bewildered\", \"Think\", \"I Don't Mind\", and \"I'll Go Crazy\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned singing, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, James Brown and the Famous Flames numerous R&B hit songs reached the Top 40 on the R&B and pop charts.They also appeared in the Hollywood films T.A.M.I. Show (1964) and Ski Party. Members of the Flames also contributed as songwriters and choreographers. In 2012 the Flames were retroactively inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside Brown. On their Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, they are described as \"a group of singers, performers and dancers that created the complementary elements of one of the greatest stage shows of all time.\"\nAs of  2020, The Famous Flames were also inducted into The National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.The Famous Flames are sometimes erroneously identified as James Brown's \"band\", a confusion partly fostered by their record companies' inconsistent labeling credit practices. Although members of the group did play instruments in some of their earliest shows and recordings, by 1959 Brown had hired a touring band and from that point on, the Flames contributed primarily as backing vocalists and dancers. The band was billed separately as the James Brown Band, and later as the James Brown Orchestra."

At the time it was recorded, the authorship of the song was not widely known, being commonly covered by diverse artists. Cash learned from Maybelle Carter that the song was written by Ervin T. Rouse, who Cash later met during a show in Miami, Florida. Cash's recording is unusual in his repertoire for featuring a tenor saxophone solo by Boots Randolph, an instrument (and musician) rarely spotlighted on Cash's recordings.\nThe album also contains three covers of Bob Dylan songs: \"It Ain't Me Babe\", \"Don't Think Twice, it's Alright\" and \"Mama, You've Been on My Mind\". The last one was only recorded by Dylan as a demo, but it was first released in an album by Cash. Cash had previously borrowed the melody of \"Don't Think Twice\" for his recording \"Understand Your Man.\"\nReleased in February 1965, the album reached number three on the Billboard Country Albums chart as well as forty-nine on the Billboard 200. The single \"Orange Blossom Special\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Country Singles and the duet with June Carter \"It Ain't Me Babe\" peaked at number four in Hot Country Singles."

Cavaliere was inspired to compose the song by his girlfriend Adrienne Buccheri, whom he only got to meet every Sunday amidst heavy touring and recording. Musically, the song differs from most of band's previous output, leaving the garage rock genre for Latin American influences, such as bai\u00e3o. Lyrically, \"Groovin'\" tells the tale of a narrator spending time with his partner on a Sunday afternoon. The song was arranged and recorded at the Talentmasters Studios, New York City in March of 1967.\nInitially, Atlantic Records were skeptical of releasing \"Groovin'\" as a single, given that it deviated from their previous output. After hearing it, the disc jockey Murray the K convinced Jerry Wexler to release it. \"Groovin'\" was released as a single on April 10, 1967 backed by \"Sue\u00f1o\". It became a commercial hit, reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1967. It peaked at number eight in the UK as the Young Rascals' only hit there.\nUpon initial release, \"Groovin'\" received widespread critical acclaim by critics, who noted the new direction the Young Rascals took with the single. Owing to the success, it became the title track of the band's third studio album. Retrospective appraisal of the single have often noted the experimental nature of the single. Shortly after the release of the original, Booker T. & the M.G.'s recorded a cover that reached number 21 on Billboard Hot 100, while War and Pato Banton have seen success with their versions. The Young Rascals original version is on the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list and has been awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award."

The band's songwriter/guitarist Gary Kemp realised after the release of their second album that the nightclub audience they initially wanted to attract had lost interest in them in part because of the band's transition from dance music to pop. He no longer felt obligated to keep writing music for them and shifted his focus to soul and R&B influences such as Marvin Gaye and Al Green for this album. Kemp thought that bandmate Steve Norman's newfound interest in the saxophone would be well-suited to the sound he was going for, as would the decision to record most of the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas.\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to begin work on the album with producer Trevor Horn, the band tested out their working relationship with Tony Swain and Steve Jolley while recording its first single, \"Lifeline\", and chose to produce the album alongside them. \"Lifeline\" was a top ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, and its follow-up, \"Communication\", also did well. The album became available as the second single climbed the charts, and the overwhelming response to the title track dictated its release as the third single from the album, leading it to four weeks as the most popular song in the UK. It also became their first song to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, where it peaked at number four. A fourth single, \"Gold\", reached number two in the UK but only got as high as 29 in the US, which Kemp attributed to internal conflicts at their record label that took time away from promoting the band.\nOn the album charts, True reached number one in the UK and number 19 in the US while also having success in numerous other countries. It achieved platinum certification for sales of 300,000 units in the UK less than three months after its release. Most critics thought the album was enjoyable, but there were those who found something or much to dislike. The choice of suits for the album photos and \"True\" music video was thought to have misled US audiences by presenting them as too clean cut to have much else to offer other than soul ballads like the title song."

As the founder of influential proto-punk band The Modern Lovers, Richman had striven to convey authentic emotions and storytelling with his music. I, Jonathan continued this aesthetic with simple and sparse rock and roll arrangements, and straightforward lyrics about everyday topics, such as music, parties, summer, and dancing. It is widely-regarded as one of his best works, and is considered an influential album in the lo-fi genre.\nSongs on the album addressed topics such as backyard parties (\"Parties in the U.S.A\"), memories of neighborhoods in which Richman had lived (\"Rooming House on Venice Beach\" and \"Twilight in Boston\") and his admiration of his primary musical inspiration, the Velvet Underground (\"Velvet Underground\").  The latter song includes a brief interlude of the Velvet Underground song, \"Sister Ray\".The album helped increase Richman's cultural profile, which would include a 1993 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien during which Richman performed one of the album's songs, \"I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar.\"The album was recorded through the summer of 1991 \"in John 'Guitar' Girton's cozy frayed carpet of a basement studio\" in the \"summer swelter\" of Grass Valley, California. \nThe album was originally released on Cassette and Compact Disc, but was released by Craft Recordings on vinyl for the first time in 2020."

Computer hackers obtained an a cappella version of the song, and added their own production before leaking the song online.

Music journalist Rob Fitzpatrick characterizes \"Light Years Away\" as a cut above: \"this new track was something else, a brilliantly spare and sparse piece of electro hip-hop, LYA traversed inner and outer space, matching rolling congas with vocoder voices and the hiss and sizzle of cutting edge synth and drum machine technology.\" The rhyme in \"Light Years Away\" invokes a stark, cyberpunk Philip K. Dickian vision of the future. Newsweek highlighted the song's experimental use of vocoders and sci-fi street imagery in \"Language Arts & Disciplines: Sci-Fi Street Sounds.\"The 12\" recording employed other innovative features for its time, such as incorporating both singing and rapping, a feminist rap by Ada Dyre, live Latin percussion overdubs in combination with Roland TR-808 beats, and a unique take on the snare (backbeat). The snare is syncopated so that the backbeat arrives a 1/16th note early on the second beat of each bar; the fourth beat is not syncopated.\n\n\n== References =="

Throughout 2004, the band went on the Warped Tour before going on their own headlining tour, and closed the year supporting Coheed and Cambria. \"Reinventing Your Exit\" was released as the lead single in February 2005. An appearance on the inaugural Taste of Chaos tour led to another headlining US tour, shows in Europe and a second spell on Warped Tour.

Following the release of four Spanish-language albums, and the huge success of his fourth studio album, Vuelve (1998), Martin announced the recording of his first English language album. He worked with producers KC Porter, Robi Rosa, and Desmond Child to create the album. Musically, Ricky Martin consists of dance-pop tracks, power ballads, mid-tempo pop songs, and rock numbers. After the album's release, Martin embarked on the worldwide Livin' la Vida Loca Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2000 by a Latin artist.\nThe album was supported by four singles. The lead single \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" topped the charts in more than 20 countries and is considered to be Martin's biggest hit and one of the best-selling singles of all time. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five consecutive weeks, becoming Martin's first number one single on the chart. Follow-up singles \"She's All I Ever Had\", \"Shake Your Bon-Bon\", and \"Private Emotion\" became number one and top 10 hits around the world.

The album has received several certifications, including 7\u00d7 platinum in the United States, and diamond in Canada. Only within three months, it became the best-selling album ever by a Latin artist.

The album was a follow-up to the Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record, which was released in 1974. The tape is however a completely different album consisting of entirely new material.\nThe album was conceived and written by National Lampoon contributing editor Ed Subitzky. The designer and writer for the wrapper (which was a spoof of consumer advertising) was Tibor Kalman, at M& co studio, and the sound designer for the album itself was Bob Pomann. The album was directed by Maurice Peterson, who also cast the album, and voice-acted several parts: a person with whiplash, a truck driver and a hobo.The cassette is the main item in the Official National Lampoon Stereo Test & Demonstration Kit, which also includes a faux leather \"travel case\", cotton swabs, and a small bottle of cleaner fluid (for cleaning the heads on a cassette deck).The album is a parody of stereo test and demonstration records, which were used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test the performance of their audio systems. All of the items recorded on the tape are comedy sketches; the majority of them are also functional car stereo tests. One sketch is an old-fashioned country music song of love lost, where the lyrics use tones that vary from 30 cycles per second (now known as the hertz) up to 15,000 cycles per second. Another sketch explains to the consumer how to play a trick on passengers in the car by using the left and right, as well as front and back, speaker volume controls to make it appear that fart noises are emanating from one particular area inside the car. Other comedy sketches help determine if a unit is in phase or out of phase, and whether a system has good left-right separation. The effects of interference noise and poor reception on car stereos are also demonstrated in comic ways.\nAn advertisement for the Official National Lampoon Car Stereo Test and Demonstration Tape ran in the July 1980 issue of National Lampoon magazine.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single \"Eleanor Rigby\" / \"Yellow Submarine\". The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in the history of popular music, with recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds and lyrical content.\nThe Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. Regarded by some commentators as the start of the group's psychedelic period, the songs reflect their interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde while addressing themes such as death and transcendence of material concerns. With no plans to reproduce their new material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up. Among its tracks are \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", incorporating heavy Indian drone and a collage of tape loops; \"Eleanor Rigby\", a song about loneliness featuring a string octet as its only musical backing; and \"Love You To\", a foray into Hindustani classical music. The sessions also produced a non-album single, \"Paperback Writer\", backed with \"Rain\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the album's 14 tracks were gradually distributed to radio stations in the weeks before its release. In North America, Revolver was reduced to 11 songs by Capitol Records, with the omitted three appearing on the June 1966 LP Yesterday and Today. The release there coincided with the Beatles' final concert tour and the controversy surrounding John Lennon's remark that the band had become \"more popular than Jesus\". The album topped the Record Retailer chart in the UK for seven weeks and the US Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks. Critical reaction was highly favourable in the UK but less so in the US amid the press's unease at the band's outspokenness on contemporary issues.\nRevolver expanded the boundaries of pop music, revolutionised standard practices in studio recording, advanced principles espoused by the 1960s counterculture, and inspired the development of psychedelic rock, electronica, progressive rock and world music. The album cover, designed by Klaus Voormann, combined Aubrey Beardsley-inspired line drawing with photo collage and won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. Aided by the 1987 international CD release, which standardised its content to the original Parlophone version, Revolver has surpassed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) in many critics' estimation as the Beatles' best album. It was ranked first in the 1998 and 2000 editions of Colin Larkin's book All Time Top 1000 Albums and third in the 2003 and 2012 editions of Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It has been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and 5\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2022."

Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund Bj\u00f8rklund, Beyonc\u00e9 and produced by Stargate and Beyonc\u00e9. \"Irreplaceable\" was originally a country record; it was re-arranged as a mid-tempo ballad with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyonc\u00e9 and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about female empowerment.\nFollowing the moderate chart performances of \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" and \"Ring the Alarm\", \"Irreplaceable\" was released internationally on October 23, 2006, as the album's second single, and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006.

Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. \"Irreplaceable\" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards.

It became Beyonc\u00e9's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been Mariah Carey in 2005. \"Irreplaceable\" also peaked at number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and New Zealand, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top ten in several other European countries. \"Irreplaceable\" was the most successful song of 2007 in the US and 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6 million copies sold worldwide. It also was the most downloaded female ringtone of the 2000s decade in the US.\nThe single's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and served as the debut performance of Beyonc\u00e9's all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for \"Irreemplazable\", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 2007 Awards. \"Irreplaceable\" has regularly featured in Beyonc\u00e9's tours and live performances since 2006.

They chose Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore to produce the album, with whom they developed a strong rapport. Recording took place from November to December 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nMusically, Revolutions per Minute is rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. Critics noted that the album exhibited greater musical maturity and an overall darker tone when compared to its predecessor. It comprises thirteen songs, with lyrical themes ranging from relationships and politics. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively with other Fat Wreck Chords bands, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour.\nUpon its release, the album peaked at number 35 on the Independent Albums chart, and was praised for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of genres. Some critics called it one of the best albums of the year. According to Bryne Yancey of Punknews.org, Revolutions per Minute not only popularized the melodic hardcore genre, but also influenced \"literally thousands of bands\" with its music and social commentary. The album also introduced several aspects that would become common traits in Rise Against's newer material, such as extensive social commentary, and reliance on musical accessibility.

Medley formed the group with Hatfield in 1963. They had first performed together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called the Paramours, and adopted the name The Righteous Brothers when they became a duo. Their most active recording period was in the 1960s and '70s, and, after several years inactive as a duo, Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1981 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. The term \"blue-eyed soul\" is thought to have first been coined by Philadelphia radio DJ Georgie Woods in 1964 when describing the duo's music.Hatfield and Medley had contrasting vocal ranges, which helped them create a distinctive sound as a duet. They each had the vocal talent to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice, with Hatfield taking the higher-register vocals with his tenor. His voice reached the register of a countertenor.Following a year and a half of Top 40 non-entries on Billboard's Hot 100, the duo hit big with the late-1964 release of what would become their signature record, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" \u2013 a transatlantic number one produced by Phil Spector, often considered one of his finest works and a landmark recording in popular music. Other notable hits include three US 1965 Top Tens \u2013 \"Just Once in My Life\" and covers of \"Unchained Melody\" (also a huge hit in 1990 after being featured in the film Ghost) and \"Ebb Tide\" \u2013 and the massive US 1966 number one \"(You're My) Soul and Inspiration\", plus the 1974 comeback hit \"Rock and Roll Heaven\". Both Hatfield and Medley also had for a time their own solo careers. In 2016, Medley re-formed The Righteous Brothers with Bucky Heard and they continue to perform as a duo.The Righteous Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked them no. 16 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time."

Records in the US. As a result of the Sex Pistols' volatile internal relationships, the band's lineup saw changes during the recording of the album. Original bass guitarist Glen Matlock left the band early in the recording process, and while he is credited as a co-writer on all but two of the tracks, he only played bass and sang backing vocals on one track, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" Recording sessions continued with a new bass player, Sid Vicious, who is credited on two of the songs written by the band after he joined. While Vicious's bass playing appeared on two tracks, his lack of skill on the instrument meant that many of the tracks were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones playing bass instead. Drummer Paul Cook, Jones and singer Johnny Rotten appear on every track. The various recording sessions were led alternately by Chris Thomas or Bill Price, and sometimes both together, but as the songs on the final albums often combined mixes from different sessions, or were poorly documented who was present in the recording booth at the time, each song is jointly credited to both producers.\nBy the time of its release, the Sex Pistols were already controversial, having spoken profanity on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from playing live in some parts of Britain. The album title added to that controversy, with some people finding the word \"bollocks\" offensive. Many record stores refused to carry it and some record charts refused to list its title, showing just a blank space instead. Due in part to its notoriety, and in spite of many sales bans at major retailers, the album debuted at number one on the UK Album Charts. It achieved advance orders of 125,000 copies after a week of its release and went gold only a few weeks later, on 17 November. It remained a best-seller for nearly a year, spending 48 weeks in the top 75. The album has also been certified platinum by the RIAA. It has seen several reissues, the latest in 2017.\nThe album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and Johnny Rotten's sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the greatest and most important albums of all time. In 1987, Rolling Stone magazine named the album the second best of the previous 20 years, behind only the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The same magazine ranked it 73rd on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2020. In 2006, it was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest albums ever."

The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over heterosexual relationships, became a symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's girl power philosophy. It was written and recorded quickly. The result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The Spice Girls were not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, by Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a success on the British cable network the Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently, the song had intensive radio airplay across England, while the Spice Girls performed it on television and began doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines.\nResponding to the wave of interest, Virgin released the song as the Spice Girls' debut single in Japan in June 1996 and in the UK the following month, well ahead of the planned release of the Spice album. \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a quadruple platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It was released in the United States in January 1997, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, \"Wannabe\" had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 37.Despite mixed reviews from critics, \"Wannabe\" won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards. \"Wannabe\" became the best-selling single by a girl group, with 1,385,211 copies sold in United Kingdom by 2017, 2,910,000 in the United States by 2014, and more than 7 million copies worldwide by the end of 1997. In a 2014 study it was found to be the most recognisable pop song of the last 60 years. An EP, Wannabe 25, was released in 2021 for the single's 25th anniversary."

Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine.\" Before the release of \"Beguine,\" Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as Monty Norman in England, whose \"James Bond Theme\" features a vamp possibly influenced by Shaw's 1938 recording of \"Nightmare\".Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the big bands he led. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1942 to 1944, during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific. Following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954."

These developments were reflected by his most notable string of hit singles between 1964 and 1968, many of them covers.

He wrote and recorded Airtight's Revenge during a period of approximately three years, working alongside the musician-producers Steve McKie, Nottz, Shafiq Husayn, Conley \"Tone\" Whitfield, and 88-Keys. The album's soul and rock music is more electronic- and guitar-oriented than Bilal's previous albums, featuring influences from jazz, blues, and futurism. Experiences from his personal life and professional conflicts with his former label, Interscope Records, formed the inspiration for the album's dark songwriting, which explores themes of love, spirituality, capitalism, and politics, with lyrics informed by free thought.\nThe album debuted at number 106 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 4,600 copies in its first week. Although it charted modestly, Airtight's Revenge was well received by music critics upon its release. PopMatters ranked the album number 61 in its year-end list of best albums for 2010, calling it a \"wildly inventive, wildly enjoyable album\"."

A pop and R&B album, it departs from the soul genre found on Prince's previous efforts.\nThe album received generally mixed reviews from critics, who enjoyed the guest appearances on the album, but were confused by Prince's attempts at harnessing the pop music market. Commercially, the album peaked at number eighteen in the United States and number five in Canada, becoming his most successful album in over three years, with similar results elsewhere. By the end of 1999, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album's first and only single, \"The Greatest Romance Ever Sold\", peaked at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the album's only song to chart. Second and third singles, duets \"So Far, So Pleased\" and \"Hot Wit' U\", were planned for released in summer 2000, but were both cancelled after the album's lukewarm commercial success. Instead, two promotional singles were released, \"Baby Knows\" and \"Man'O'War\". To promote the album, Prince hosted a pay-per-view event, entitled Rave Un2 the Year 2000 which would later be released on DVD."

Mute Records released the single in the UK under the title Moon & the Sky Plus, a similar tactic used for one of Erasure's previous singles (\"Rain\").\nThe song was written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell and is an uptempo, electronic dance track. In its album version the song has a harsher, more techno-influenced feel. Maverick Records, Erasure's US record label at the time, requested the single remixes but ended up passing on the Loveboat album altogether and releasing Erasure from their contract, leaving Mute Records to release the US version of Loveboat in 2003.\nThe extended track count and running time of Moon & the Sky Plus made it ineligible for the UK Singles Chart at the time. A twelve-inch single, presented as a double A-side with a remix of \"Perchance to Dream\" was also released. Similar to the promo version (P12MUTE248) distributed to nightclub DJs to promote the album, the two-track record was credited to \"V & A\" (referring to the members of Erasure, Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, rather than naming them outright). The 12\" was only available from the Mute Records' own shop (Mute Bank) and specialist dance music shops.\"Moon & the Sky\" demoed as a slow, acoustic song. There are two versions recorded of this version, one in English, and another one in French, titled \"Chanson\".

(The recording did not include most of the music written by Gershwin which had been customarily cut from productions in the United States, however. As opposed to the complete three-hour opera, the album was two hours and nine minutes.)\nThe recording came about as a result of Lehman Engel and Goddard Lieberson's desire to record albums of Broadway shows whose scores had never been put on disc. Among the musicals the team had recorded (or would record) were Oh, Kay!, Babes in Arms, Girl Crazy, and Pal Joey.  Although there had been an album of Porgy and Bess since 1940, there had never been a 3-LP version. The 1951 album set contained more than two-thirds of the opera, for the first time ever in the history of recording.\nThe album was recorded between April 5 and April 13, 1951.\nThe album was originally released on 3 twelve-inch 331\u20443 rpm LPs. Columbia Masterworks assigned the album the catalog number OSL 162.  The recording was later remastered by Naxos Records and re-released on CD.\nSeveral members of the original Broadway cast of Porgy and Bess appeared on the album."

Before long, however, both the \"joke\" and the \"country\" parts of the concept were eliminated, thus allowing the band to develop into a quirky alternative rock outfit. The Comas' respectable 1999 debut, Wave to Make Friends, was composed of sleepy (but not lethargic) indie pop and off-kilter boy-and-girl vocal harmonies, courtesy of co-founders Andrew Herod and Nicole Gehweiler. The band's instrumental canvas proved to be larger and more eclectic than that of the typical indie group, buoying the usual guitars and rhythm section with violin, organ, and creative non-rap samples. Faced with the challenge of labeling such music, the Comas' label billed deemed the sound \"stoner pop.\"\nIn 2008, lead singer Andy Herod moved to Asheville, and formed a new project, called Electric Owls, which was signed to Vagrant Records. Electric Owls has produced two EPs and a full-length record titled 'Ain't Too Bright'. Assisting him in the studio were a few friends and former member Caperton."

Over the years, several other members of Ministry played with Lard, namely Bill Rieflin, Mike Scaccia, and Rey Washam.\nLike most of Biafra's work, Lard's songs are angrily political (the War on Drugs is a particularly common theme) but often have a tinge of humor.\n\nLard has not officially toured and has only performed live a handful of times, mostly around the San Francisco area (where Jello lives and operates his Alternative Tentacles record label). The band played during Ministry's 1988 tour and throughout their 1989\u20131990 dates, once in Chicago after wrapping the recording of The Last Temptation of Reid, once at the conclusion of a Ministry concert in Los Angeles (March 24, 2003), and at the San Francisco (September 26, 2004), Portland (September 28, 2004) and Seattle (September 29, 2004) dates of Ministry's Evil Doer tour. Because its key members are active with other projects, it is unlikely that the band will tour.\nAccording to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which was to be recorded in Jourgensen's El Paso studio. However, according to a January 2010 interview with Jello Biafra, he indicated that a new Lard album was unlikely, saying \"Me and Al have talked about it for years, but we've never been able to nail down a time to try and put it together.\".According to a 2020 interview Jourgensen said that he and Biafra plan to make a brand new Lard album soon with them emailing songs back and forth."

The group comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.\nOriginally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which featured \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"The Rover\" and \"Kashmir\".\nPage composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980, feeling that they would not be \"Led Zeppelin\" without him. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.\nLed Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US Billboard 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the Seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s."

They were also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental pop rock band Psychic TV.\nBorn in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted Genesis P-Orridge as their pseudonym. On returning to Hull, they founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 Prostitution show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \"wreckers of civilisation.\" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house.\nIn 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, they married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \"pandrogyne\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, they retired from music to focus on other artistic media in 2009.\nP-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases during their lifetime. They were cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and had been given the moniker of the \"Godparent of Industrial Music\". P-Orridge considered themself third-gender and used various gender-neutral pronouns."

It received favorable reviews, but sold poorly, reaching number 151 on the US record charts during a four-week stay and becoming the lowest-charting Beach Boys album to that point. \"Add Some Music to Your Day\" was the only single that charted in the US, peaking at number 64. In the UK, the album peaked at number 29.\nWorking titles for the album included Reverberation, Add Some Music, and The Fading Rock Group Revival. The recording sessions began in January 1969, and, after a year-long search for a new record contract, completed in July 1970. In contrast to 20/20, the record featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. About four dozen songs were written for the album, and the label rejected numerous revisions of its track listing before the band presented enough formidable material deemed satisfactory for release. It includes \"This Whole World\", one of Brian Wilson's most complex songs, \"Forever\", regarded as among Dennis Wilson's finest, and \"Cool, Cool Water\", a song that originated from the band's Smile sessions.\n\nFans generally consider Sunflower to be the Beach Boys' finest post-Pet Sounds album. It has appeared in several critics' and listeners' polls for the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The track \"All I Wanna Do\" was later cited as one of the earliest examples of dream pop and chillwave. Many Sunflower outtakes and leftover songs later appeared on subsequent Beach Boys releases, including the follow-up Surf's Up (1971) and the compilation Feel Flows (2021)."

On late 1985, Madonna and Leonard began working on her third studio album; she also enlisted the help of former boyfriend Stephen Bray, with whom she had worked on her previous record Like a Virgin (1984). Titled True Blue, the record saw Madonna co-writing and co-producing for the first time in her career. It is a dance-pop album that features influences of Motown sound, girl groups, and Latin pop. It was inspired by Madonna's love for Penn, to whom she dedicated the album.\nUpon release, the album was well received by critics, who complimented Madonna's vocals and musical growth. It was an immediate global success, reaching number one in a record-breaking 28 countries across the world. With over 25 million copies sold worldwide, True Blue is the best-selling album of 1986, the best-selling of the 1980s by a female artist, and one of the best-selling albums of all time.

Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisq\u00f3 and Woody released solo albums. Dru Hill was influenced by the Dragon and Asian culture, as displayed in their wardrobe and logo. While Woody's album, Soul Music, was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq\u00f3's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit singles, \"Thong Song\" and \"Incomplete\", were major pop successes, and established Sisq\u00f3 as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisq\u00f3's second album, Return of Dragon, did not perform as well.\nIn 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, following a merger between Island, sister label Def Jam Recordings and Universal Music Group, the group reunited and added fifth member Scola to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order; after that album underperformed the group met with Island Def Jam president L.A.

In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, InDRUpendence Day, the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody."

It was released by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records on November 24, 2008, having been recorded earlier that year in September and October at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. Dominating its production, West was assisted by fellow producers No I.D., Plain Pat, Jeff Bhasker, and Mr Hudson, while also utilizing guest vocalists for some tracks, including Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, and Lil Wayne.\nConceived in the wake of West's breakup with his then-fianc\u00e9e Alexis Phifer and the death of his mother Donda West in 2007, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major artistic departure from his previous rap records. Instead, West performed sung vocals that were processed through an Auto-Tune processor against an electronic production and minimalist sonic palette, including prominent use of minor keys and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. West's lyrics on the album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, inspired by the distressing personal events, as well as his struggles with pop stardom.\n808s & Heartbreak debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling just over 450,000 copies in its first week. Despite varying responses from listeners, the album received positive reviews from most music critics, who generally commended West's experimentation, and was named one of 2008's best records in several year-end lists. Four singles were released in its promotion, including the hit singles \"Love Lockdown\", which became the highest Billboard Hot 100 debut of West's career, and \"Heartless\". Despite the positive critical reception, nominations were mostly overlooked for the 52nd Grammy Awards, although the single \"Amazing\" received a nomination in the category of Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.\nAmong West's most influential records, 808s & Heartbreak made an immediate impact on hip hop, pop, and R&B music, as a new wave of rappers, singers, and producers adopted its stylistic and thematic elements. Further impact has been noted for pioneering the emo rap and experimental R&B subgenres in particular. Rolling Stone later included the album in its list of \"The 40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time\" and provided a ranking at number 244 on its revised list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. By 2013, it had sold 1.7 million copies in the United States, where a triple platinum was awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020."

Brown was a 1993 inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nFollowing a resurgence that began in the mid-1970s and peaked in the 1980s, Brown used her influence to press for musicians' rights regarding royalties and contracts; these efforts led to the founding of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Her performances in the Broadway musical Black and Blue earned Brown a Tony Award, and the original cast recording won a Grammy Award. Brown was a recipient of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016. In 2017, Brown was inducted into National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.

However, The Real McKenzies have done just that - putting them amongst the celebrated ranks of D.O.A and Ripcordz in the Canadian punk scene and alongside The Stampeders and The Irish Rovers in the Canadian music scene overall.\nLead singer, Paul McKenzie and The Irish Rovers manager Jennifer Fahrni are cousins."

He was active in two distinct periods, first in the heyday of early rhythm and blues and later in the resurgence of interest in traditional jazz after the founding of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1970.  His piano style has been described as \"instantly recognizable, combining rumba, mambo, and calypso\".Music journalist Tony Russell (in his book The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray) wrote that \"The vivacious rhumba-rhythmed piano blues and choked singing typical of Fess were too weird to sell millions of records; he had to be content with siring musical offspring who were simple enough to manage that, like Fats Domino or Huey \"Piano\" Smith. But he is also acknowledged as a father figure by subtler players like Allen Toussaint and Dr. John.\""

It was recorded in early 1985 at Weryton Studios, Munich, following a turbulent period: co-founder, lead guitarist and co-principal songwriter Mick Jones and drummer Topper Headon had been dismissed by lead vocalist Joe Strummer and bassist Paul Simonon. Jones and Headon were replaced  by three unknowns: guitarists Vince White and Nick Sheppard and drummer Pete Howard. During the tense recording sessions, Clash manager Bernie Rhodes and Strummer fought each other for control over the band's songwriting and musical direction.\nStrummer and Rhodes co-wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes took charge of the arrangements, track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for synthetic drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of sampling, were widely derided. One writer described the album's sound as brash and seemingly \"designed to sound hip and modern\u2014'80s style!\". Rhodes chose the album title, taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2.  The recording process and tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for a lead single. \nOn release, Cut the Crap was maligned in the UK music press as \"one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist\". Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release. He performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash's compilations and box sets. Although it is still generally regarded as the band's worst album, contemporary critics have praised Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\"."

After releasing this album, they charted two more singles (\"The Wish\" and \"Amnesia\"), the latter of which was not included on an album. By 1999, Blake & Brian had parted ways. Gowan released a solo album entitled Warm Spanish Wine in 2000. He also co-wrote Rodney Atkins' 1997 debut single \"In a Heartbeat\" and three songs on Atkins' 2003 debut album Honesty."

Previously, the group had released their major-label debut, My Dinosaur Life (2010) on Columbia; the band parted ways with the label due to the record's lackluster commercial response. Following this, the band returned to their home of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with producer and longtime friend Ackerson. The band entered a local studio and recorded their next effort on their own time and finances. The band recorded Go without a label, and put it upon themselves to pay for mixing and mastering and have conversations with distributors later.\nFrontman Justin Pierre composed the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, and learning to live in the moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013.\nGo received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, and peaked at number eight on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. \"True Romance\" was the album's lead single, and featured a one-shot music video reminiscent of the works of Spike Jonze."

        "content": "The Seekers were an Australian folk-influenced pop group originally formed in Melbourne in 1962. They were the first Australian pop music group to achieve major chart and sales success in the United Kingdom and the United States. They were especially popular during the 1960s, with their best-known configuration of Judith Durham on vocals, piano and tambourine; Athol Guy on double bass and vocals; Keith Potger on twelve-string guitar, banjo and vocals; and Bruce Woodley on guitar, mandolin, banjo and vocals.\nThe group had Top 10 hits in the 1960s with \"I'll Never Find Another You\", \"A World of Our Own\", \"Morningtown Ride\", \"Someday, One Day\", \"Georgy Girl\" and \"The Carnival Is Over\". Australian music historian Ian McFarlane described their style as \"concentrated on a bright, uptempo sound, although they were too pop to be considered strictly folk and too folk to be rock\". In 1967, they were named as joint \"Australians of the Year\" \u2013 the only group thus honoured. In July 1968, Durham left to pursue a solo career and the group disbanded. Keith Potger formed a new group in the UK, the New Seekers, which had a hit single in 1971 with \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\".\nIn 1995, the Seekers were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. \"I'll Never Find Another You\" was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011. Woodley's and Dobe Newton's song \"I Am Australian\", which was recorded by the Seekers as well as Durham with Russell Hitchcock and Mandawuy Yunupingu, has become an unofficial Australian anthem. With \"I'll Never Find Another You\" and \"Georgy Girl\", the group also achieved success in the United States, but not nearly at the same level as in the rest of the world. The Seekers have sold over 50 million records worldwide and were individually honoured as Officers of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 2014."

As its title indicates, Transition was a bridge between classic quartet recordings like A Love Supreme and the more experimental works of Coltrane's last years.\nColtrane's playing alternates between blues idioms and the free jazz that would dominate his final work. Of the four musicians on this album, pianist McCoy Tyner was still the most grounded in traditional jazz. Bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones were finding new ways to approach their instruments, while Coltrane took the lead with a newfound musical freedom.\nTransition's title track is a fifteen-minute modified blues, whilst \"Dear Lord\" is a ballad featuring Roy Haynes substituting for Jones on drums. \"Welcome,\" which replaces \"Dear Lord\" on the album's compact disc release, is a five-minute ballad with a theme pitched high in the tenor saxophone's altissimo register and making extensive use of multiphonics. The closing \"Suite\" is a twenty-minute performance, covering a variety of moods. \"Vigil\", which concludes the CD release of the album, is a fiery duet between Coltrane and Jones.\nThree months after this recording, Coltrane's quartet moved further into experimental territory with the album Sun Ship."

They released a children's album in 1996 when Larsen was 12 and Raven was 11, under the name \"Marit & Marion\". The album was nominated for a Spellemannprisen award and the band changed their name to M2M after signing a record deal with Atlantic Records in 1998. M2M were frequently praised for writing most of their songs and performing their own instruments, something which was considered to set them aside from the majority of teen pop music artists.\nTheir debut single, \"Don't Say You Love Me\" (1999), was both a critical and commercial success, and remained their biggest hit. Their debut album, Shades of Purple (2000), was critically acclaimed and sold over 1.5 million units worldwide. Despite critical acclaim, their second album, The Big Room (2001), did not perform as well commercially, and the duo broke up in 2002, with each pursuing a solo career. A greatest hits album, The Day You Went Away: The Best of M2M (2003), was released after they disbanded. M2M sold over 2 million albums."

        "content": "Up to Date is the second studio album by The Partridge Family. Released in February 1971, just four months after the group's debut LP, the album entered Billboard's Top LP's chart in early April, having been certified gold on 25 March 1971. In its fourth week on the Top 200, the album improved on its predecessor (a no. 4 peak), reaching no. 3 (behind Janis Joplin's Pearl and Jesus Christ Superstar).\nUp to Date yielded the two big pop hits \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" (Billboard no. 6/Cash Box number one) and \"I'll Meet You Halfway\" (Billboard no. 9),  which respectively reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot 100 in March and June.\nIn Canada, both \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" and its parent album reached number one on the RPM charts.As with all Partridge Family albums (with the exception of Bulletin Board), Up to Date was produced by Wes Farrell at United Western Recorders, Studio 2 in Los Angeles. And as with the group's first album, it was engineered by Bob Kovach, with arrangements by Mike Melvoin.\nConsistent with all of the Partridge Family's studio output, the album features musicians associated with iconic Los Angeles\u2013based session players \"the Wrecking Crew\": Hal Blaine (drums), Joe Osborn (bass guitar), Mike Melvoin (keyboard), Dennis Budimir (guitar) and Louie Shelton (guitar). And once again, members of overlapping studio groups the Ron Hicklin Singers and the Love Generation \u2013 brothers John and Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin and Jackie Ward \u2013 feature prominently as backing vocalists throughout the album.\nThe album features three songs written by \"I Think I Love You\" songwriter Tony Romeo, who contributed material to all eight of the Partridge Family's studio albums. The LP also includes five songs co-written by Wes Farrell, including three with prolific lyricist Gerry Goffin (former songwriting partner of Carole King). And two of the songs \u2013 including the hit \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\" \u2013 were co-written by Wes Farrell, Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, whose five Partridge Family songs as a songwriting trio include \"I Can Feel Your Heartbeat\". Between 1972 and 1975 Appel worked as manager and producer for Bruce Springsteen.\nUp to Date features David Cassidy's first contribution as a songwriter. With Wes Farrell he co-wrote the song \"Lay It on the Line\". The recording introduced a distorted guitar sound to the group's repertoire.\n\nCassidy publicly despised one of the LP's hits, \"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\", and making it proved to be a very hard task. He didn't think it was a good song at all and hated the idea of his having to talk in the middle of it so much so he refused to do it. This caused consternation with the studio and the record company, prompting the involvement of the heads of both Bell Records and Screen Gems, which at the time were the respective record and television divisions of the major Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures. Production shooting of the TV series was halted in order to provide a place in time where his manager and agent could talk to him over the issue. One of the things they were saying was about how many more copies of the record would be sold if it contained a speaking role from him. They put pressure on him until he caved in and did the record as requested.  When it was finished, he was unsuccessful in trying to keep the record shelved in Bell's vaults. His feelings toward the song remained negative: It was horrible, I was embarrassed by it. I still can't listen to that record.\nThe album's distinctive cover (overseen by Bell Records art director Beverly Weinstein) was designed in the form of a calendar indicating the birth dates of the family (including dog Simone), which were the actual birth dates of the cast members. The album also included a book cover. This was the last album to feature Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris Partridge on the cover, as he left the show soon after the album's release."

        "content": "The Deep was an American psychedelic rock band made up of musicians from New York City, who in 1966 traveled to Philadelphia to record a one-time LP, Psychedelic Moods.  The band was experimentally progressive, as they were one of the earliest groups to record psychedelic music, before it was adapted by a wider array of musical acts.  Although their only album failed to achieve success, it later gained acclaim for being considered the earliest work to reference \"psychedelic\" in its title.Information on the band is sparse as only one band member had a confirmed musical career prior to recording. The member, Rusty Evans (born Marcus Uzilevsky, 1937, New York City, died December 5, 2015, Woodacre, California), was the Deep's lead guitarist, primary songwriter, and a vocalist.  Evans initially recorded in 1958 as a rockabilly singer, before performing as a Greenwich Village folk musician in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  He recorded three albums as Rusty Evans \u2013 Songs of Our Land, Railroad Songs (both 1964) and Live at Gerde's Folk City (1965) \u2013 and was later a member of the folk group The New Christy Minstrels. Musician David Bromberg is also known to have played on The Deep's one and only album, although it is unknown on which tracks he played.In the early summer of 1966, Evans convinced producer Mark Barkan to help him record a psychedelic album.  They secured arrangements with the Philadelphia-based Cameo-Parkway label, the home for fellow protopunk act Question Mark and the Mysterians, for a meager budget of $1200.  In August, Evans and Barkan assembled a group of New York musicians to record as the Deep, and they drove in a rundown car to Philadelphia to record what would become the Psychedelic Moods album, which was done in the short period of four days and would necessitate late-night sessions in order to be finished on time.  The all-night sessions also provided the musicians, who were unable to afford a hotel, with a place to sleep.While the exact release date of the album has yet to be definitively established, the record is generally considered to have been distributed in October 1966, based on the album's catalogue number. This would credit it as the first official album to include the word \"psychedelic\" in its title, pre-dating the Blues Magoos' debut, Psychedelic Lollipop, and The 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The Deep's Psychedelic Moods did not sell well, and the group did not tour to support it. They existed as a studio-only band, and, aside from sessions for their album, produced no other recordings under that name.Evans left Cameo-Parkway to record a new album for the Columbia Records label in 1967. Abandoning the \"Deep\" name, this second album was credited to the band The Freak Scene and entitled Psychedelic Psoul. Despite the name change, the band still contained the original lineup from the first album, and the sound of this album is very similar to that of Psychedelic Moods. It is typically considered a follow-up in all but name. As its title suggests, Psychedelic Psoul is composed of psychedelic-influenced tracks as the band continued to develop past concepts from their debut album. However, The Freak Scene's album met the same results as Psychedelic Moods. They did not tour, and their album did not chart. The album has been rereleased by Sony BMG through Columbia Records on vinyl. The group disbanded in late 1967.After this venture, Evans returned to performing as a solo musician. He recorded under his birthname, Marcus, for a self-titled album in 1969, which produced compositions conceived as psychedelic folk in nature. He did not record another album until 1979, when he released Life's Railway Heaven, another folk effort. Evans recorded sporadically until his death, usually in the style of folk or rockabilly music,  and in the 1990s released two new age CDs, Slice of Light and Gypsy Dreams, credited as Uzca.  He also led a Johnny Cash tribute band.  Under his real name of Marcus Uzilevsky, he was a respected visual artist best known for his landscape paintings, and was exhibited widely in California.\n\n\n== References =="

Earl had founded the group prior to this as an all-male troupe, and Lily began filling in on the tenor parts in 1948, eventually becoming the group's most visible member.\n\nThey moved several times over the next few decades, to Fort Wayne, Indiana, Akron, Ohio, Fontana and Sacramento, California (as part of the staff of Calvary Temple), and then relocated to Paoli, Oklahoma in 1977 and are based out of there today.The group sang on California radio stations (KFOX- KBGR-KBIG ) in the 1940s, and was offered a full-time spot on radio station WOWO in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1949. In the 1950s, they recorded for RCA Victor. In 1959, The quartet's In The Garden album for RCA was produced by Chet Atkins, and also featured guitar work by Atkins.

Often cited as a pioneering act in the shoegaze genre, their sound is characterized by dissonant guitar textures, quiet and androgynous vocals, and unorthodox production techniques.\nFollowing several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released several successful EPs and the albums Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991) on the label; the latter is often described as their magnum opus and one of the greatest rock albums of all time. However, My Bloody Valentine were dropped by Creation after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, the band signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive.\nGooge and \u00d3 C\u00edos\u00f3ig left the band in 1995, and were followed by Butcher in 1997. Unable to complete a follow-up to Loveless, Shields isolated himself and, in his own words, \"went crazy\". In 2007, My Bloody Valentine reunited and subsequently embarked on a world tour.

        "content": "Mono was the first album from The Icarus Line. It was originally released May 8, 2001 in the U.S. by Crank! Records on CD, and Buddyhead on LP.\nThe album was recorded throughout two separate sessions in 2000. The first of these were conducted at the studio \"Rotund Rascal\" on Lankershim Blvd. in North Hollywood. This initial attempt at recording the entire album with Mark Trombino as engineer, ultimately resulted in only the completion of drums, bass, Alvin's guitars, and about half of Aaron's guitar tracks. In a bold move, the band fired Trombino, and resumed work over a month later with Alex Newport at Doug Messenger's Studio in North Hollywood, on Vineland Avenue. Having recorded albums such as At The Drive-In's  before at this same studio, Newport was comfortable in moving very quickly there with the band. The album, being recorded onto tape, as opposed to Pro Tools (as was customary for most bands of the time) resulted in the majority of the album being \"first takes\". The album was also mixed quickly by the band with Newport at Messenger's Studio. It was then mastered by Mark Chalecki in the Capitol Records building.\nUpon its eventual release, the album gave the band a significant push in popularity worldwide. It was included on many \"Best Albums of 2001\" lists in various publications. In support of the album, the band toured with The Dillinger Escape Plan, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Cave In, among many others.\nAlternative versions of the album were licensed and released by Sweet Nothing in Europe, Ugly Boy Records in Australia, and Victor in Japan. The Japanese CD release included \"Kill Cupid With A Nail File\" as a bonus track. Sweet Nothing issued two singles for the album in the UK. \"Feed A Cat To Your Cobra\" came first, and included tracks recorded at the band's first BBC John Peel radio session. Among these was a cover of The Stooges song, \"1970\". The second single, for \"Love Is Happiness\", included a re-recorded version of the song, as well as tracks recorded during the band's second BBC John Peel radio session. These recordings, along with a cover of the Spacemen 3 tune, \"Losing Touch With My Mind\", marked the appearance of the band's new drummer, Troy Petrey."

The duo achieved both critical and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize Southern hip hop with their intricate lyricism, memorable melodies, and positive themes, while experimenting with a diverse range of genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and techno.

With successive releases such as the critically acclaimed albums ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. Outkast then achieved more mainstream and crossover success with their critically acclaimed fourth album Stankonia (2000), which included the singles \"B.O.B.\" and \"Ms. Jackson\", the latter being their first single to reach the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100.\nThe duo then released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (2003), their only album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, which featured the number one singles \"The Way You Move\" and \"Hey Ya!.\" The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.

At the time, the Yardbirds had been performing as a quartet with Jimmy Page on lead guitar since October 1966.The album includes several familiar Yardbird songs, but often extended with longer instrumental solos.  \"I'm Confused,\" based on Jake Holmes' \"Dazed and Confused\", is a highlight of the album.  Using some different lyrics, Page re-recorded it with Led Zeppelin for their debut album later in 1968.\nThe group was dissatisfied with the recordings and objected to their release, but after Page became famous with Led Zeppelin, Epic Records issued the album in September 1971.  Page took legal action and Epic was enjoined from further distribution of the album.  Over the years, there were several more attempts to release the album.  In 2017, Page discovered the concert tapes in his personal archive and remixed the recordings.  An album with the Anderson concert and demo recordings from the same time, were released in November 2017 on Yardbirds '68."

As a result, it is the only King Diamond album which does not feature any writing credits from LaRocque. Recording a solo for \"Dressed in White\" functioned as his audition for joining the band. Along with The Spider's Lullabye, it is one of the band's only albums which is not a whole concept album.\nFatal Portrait has sold over 100,000 copies in North America alone. The title of the album comes from The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Wilde describes the painting as \"the fatal portrait\" several times throughout the novel."

The EP would have consisted of nine tracks, in alternating acid house/techno and ambient styles. However, Richard decided that it was not up to par with the others in the series, so only a handful of vinyl test pressings were made.\nIn January 2005 Rephlex mailed out black vinyl/binder editions of Analord 10.

This second batch included a free copy of Analogue Bubblebath 5. This distribution of Analogue Bubblebath 5 was unannounced.No information is printed on the record's blank white labels (although some copies do have \"AB5\" written and circled onto them), but the identifying call number of 'CAT 034' has been etched into its run-out grooves.

Primarily an R&B album, Confessions showcases Usher as a crooner through a mixture of ballads and up-tempos, incorporating musical genres of dance-pop, hip hop and crunk. The album's themes generated controversy about Usher's personal relationships; however, the album's primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the album reflects Dupri's own personal story.\nIn the United States, the album sold 1.1 million copies in its first week. To boost sales amid threats of bootlegging, the special edition for the album was issued, which includes the single, \"My Boo\"; a duet with Alicia Keys. Confessions earned Usher several awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album.\nAccording to Billboard, it is the second-best selling album of the 2000s decade in the United States, behind NSYNC's No Strings Attached. With over eight million copies sold in 2004, the album was viewed as a sign of recovering album sales in the US, following three years of decline. It was also exemplary of urban music's commercial peak and dominance of the Billboard charts in 2004. Confessions has been certified fourteen-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2006, has sold over 10.3 million copies in the US and over 15 million copies worldwide; making it the best-selling R&B album of the 21st century by a male artist.\nConfessions' concept, production and Usher's vocal delivery received acclaim since upon its release, and in 2020 the album was ranked number 432 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list."

It is the last, and one of the few Johnny Cash albums to only feature songs written by Cash himself. It is also his last non-religious concept album, and was included on the Bear Family box set Come Along and Ride This Train.

Most of the album was recorded following a grueling tour during which the band was left with little time to compose new material. Record producer Paul A. Rothchild recommended a total departure from the Doors' first three albums: develop a fuller sound by incorporating brass and string arrangements provided by Paul Harris. Lead singer Jim Morrison, who was dealing with personal issues and focusing more on his poetry, was less involved in the songwriting process, allowing guitarist Robby Krieger to increase his own creative output.\nThe album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, but it failed to retain audiences in the UK and other European countries that their previous album, Waiting for the Sun, had succeeded in engaging. Three preceding singles, \"Touch Me\", \"Wishful Sinful\", and \"Tell All the People\", were included on The Soft Parade, with the former becoming another Top 10 hit for the Doors. Another single, \"Runnin' Blue\", also followed the album's distribution. Upon release, The Soft Parade was denounced by both music critics and the band's underground music scene followers, who viewed the album as the Doors' trending into popular music. Over time, historians have reassessed the album and its critical standing has slightly improved, but it is still widely considered the group's weakest effort with Morrison."

The second single \"Tight Fit\" was a midtempo R&B ballad, just like \"Eye to Eye\" from I Feel for You produced by Russ Titelman, which reached #28 on the US R&B chart. The satirical \"Earth to Mickey\" (When are you going to land?), featuring Khan both singing and rapping (and keyboardist Reggie Griffin rapping in the role of 'Mickey'), was released as the third single in early 1987 and only just made the Top 100 of the R&B chart, peaking at #93. The dramatic ballad \"The Other Side of the World\", written by Mike Rutherford of Genesis and B. A. Robertson and which had first been released as part of the White Nights soundtrack album in late 1985, reached #81. The fifth single \"Watching the World\" never charted. The album itself fared slightly better, reaching #25 on Billboard's R&B albums chart, but stalling at #67 on Pop and #77 in the UK. Destiny however gave Khan another Grammy nomination in 1987 for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female. The track \"My Destiny\" was used as the theme song for Richard Pryor's motion picture Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling.\nThe closing track, the heavily edited one minute thirty-nine seconds \"Coltrane Dreams\", a tribute to John Coltrane, had a backing track mainly made up of samples of Khan's voice. The actual full-length version of the track (4:54) was only released as the B-side of the 12\" single \"Love of a Lifetime\".\n\"Love of a Lifetime\", \"Tight Fit\", \"Earth to Mickey\" and \"Watching the World\" were all released as 12\" singles including extended remixes.\nWhile the success of Khan's own single releases in 1986 was limited to the R&B charts, she appeared as featured vocalist/vocal arranger on two worldwide pop/rock chart hits that same year, Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" and Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\"; on the latter she was only credited for 'vocal arrangement' in the liner notes. The song was originally recorded with Khan sharing lead vocals with Palmer but due to contractual problems between Warner Bros. Records and Island Records her own vocals were removed from the final mix."

Their musical style combines traditional music from all over the world and vocals with contemporary western synthesizer-based psychedelic music. When asked to describe Shpongle's music, Posford has responded that it is \"like nothing you've ever heard before.\"Shpongle's first track, \"Vapour Rumours\", was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in 1996. Their debut album, Are You Shpongled?, was released in 1998 on Twisted Records. On 9 September 2014, Posford confirmed beginning work on a sixth album, which was released as Codex VI on 23 October 2017. On 3 October 2017, even before the release of Codex VI, the duo announced via a Facebook video that they have begun working on their seventh studio album. Since 30 June 2017, the duo have also been releasing remasters of their previous albums, focussing on releasing special edition vinyl records.Posford is generally responsible for the synthesizers, studio work, and live instrumentation, while Raja Ram contributes broad musical concepts and flute arrangements. Raja Ram stated in an interview that \"Shpongle\" is an umbrella term for feeling positive and euphoric emotions. Shpongle's music is heavily influenced by psychedelic experiences and frequently makes use of sonic textures that approximate psychedelic states as well as vocal samples relating to consciousness expansion, hallucinations, and altered states of awareness. For example, the track \"A New Way to Say 'Hooray'\" contains a vocal sample of Terence McKenna describing the effects of DMT."

In the recording industry, he was known as the \"utility man\" because of his ability to play with sufficient skill on many different instruments in addition to the harmonica; for example, he played trumpet on Dylan's \"Rainy Day Women \u266f12 & 35\", saxophone on Roy Orbison's \"Oh, Pretty Woman\", and bass harmonica on Simon and Garfunkel's \"The Boxer\". For Elvis Presley's 1965 film Harum Scarum (soundtrack), he played guitar, harmonica, organ, and vibraphone. \nHe is a member of three halls of fame, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame; he was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007 as a part of a group of session musicians dubbed \"The Nashville A-Team\".

Their classic lineup (1964\u20131978) consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large public address systems, the use of synthesisers, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"My Generation\" (1965), \"Substitute\" (1966) and \"Happy Jack\" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released \"I Can See for Miles\", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album Tommy included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success.\nFurther festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album Live at Leeds (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album Who's Next (1971), including the hits \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Baba O'Riley\", and \"Behind Blue Eyes\". The group released another concept album, Quadrophenia (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.\nKenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996\u20131997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with Endless Wire.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album Who and toured with a symphony orchestra."

The Cash original \"Lonesome to the Bone\" had previously appeared on Ragged Old Flag (1974) and would make one more appearance on Silver (1979).Cash himself disliked John R. Cash, criticizing both the album and its production process in his 1997 autobiography, Cash: The Autobiography. He said the release was \"[the CBS bosses'] idea of an album to restore [Cash's] sales potential\", mentioning that the instrumental tracks were recorded separately from the vocals, a standard practice Cash didn't usually follow himself. In addition, this was the first Johnny Cash album on which his regular backing group, The Tennessee Three did not participate; instead, producer Gary Klein recruited a number of session musicians including members of Elvis Presley's TCB Band concert backing group, including guitarist James Burton, pianist Larry Muhoberac and drummer Ron Tutt."

According to Billboard, it was the top-selling single of 1984. It is certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the last single released by a solo artist to receive a Platinum certification before the certification requirements were lowered in 1989. \"When Doves Cry\" was ranked number one on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1984. Following Prince's death, the song re-charted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eight, its first appearance in the top 10 since the week ending September 1, 1984.\nThe music video, directed by Prince, premiered on MTV in June 1984. It opens with white doves emerging from double doors to reveal Prince in a bathtub, then shows him performing the song in various scenes. The video sparked controversy among network executives, who thought that its sexual nature was too explicit for television. \"When Doves Cry\" is ranked number 37 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll."

Glassheart was conceived in 2010 shortly after the completion of Lewis' first headline tour, The Labyrinth. Recording and production took place in Denver, Los Angeles and London; originally the album was due for release in November 2011 but was pushed back several times to accommodate new recording sessions and allow more creative time. The album was the first \u2013 and so far only \u2013 of Lewis' albums not released in North America.\nOn Glassheart, Lewis reunites with Ryan Tedder, record producer of her previous singles \"Bleeding Love\" and \"Happy\" and songwriter Andrea Martin who co-wrote \"Better in Time\", in addition to a number of new collaborators such as British duo Naughty Boy and Emeli Sand\u00e9, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and DJ Frank E. Producer Fraser T Smith executive produced the album after impressing Lewis with his work on Hurt: The EP (2011), a cover song extended play (EP) that Lewis released to bridge the gap between Echo (2009) and Glassheart.\n\"Collide\", a collaboration with house music DJ Avicii, was released on 2 September 2011. Originally a song by just Lewis, Avicii sued Sony Music claiming that the song plagiarised his own instrumental \"Penguin\". Through mutual agreement it was released as a collaboration, becoming a top-five hit in the UK and Lewis' first to top the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The Afrojack remix of \"Collide\" is the only version to feature on Glassheart. Subsequent singles \"Trouble\" featuring American rapper Childish Gambino and \"Lovebird\" were less successful, the former reaching the top ten in the UK and top thirty in Ireland, while the latter sold fewer than 600 copies in the UK and failed to chart anywhere in Europe.\nGlassheart received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the vocals and experimental use of dubstep and electronic music but were less impressed with the album's many ballads. In the UK, the album was Lewis' first album not to reach number one, debuting at number three with 27,000 copies in its first week. Elsewhere the album became Lewis' third top-five album in Ireland, and upon its international release in November 2012, reached the top thirty in some of continental Europe. Following a 2013 release for Austria and Germany, Glassheart peaked at number five and six respectively, outperforming previous album Echo. In April 2013, Lewis embarked on the Glassheart Tour, in support of the album, visiting Switzerland, Germany and the UK."

Two songs from Dulcinea charted on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts: \"Fall Down\" and \"Something's Always Wrong\". Dulcinea was RIAA Certified Gold on September 1, 1994 and Platinum on July 31, 1995.\nThe album's name is a reference to the love interest in Miguel de Cervantes' classic Spanish novel, Don Quixote.  At least two songs on the album allude to themes found in the novel. \"Crowing\" is a song about a person who does not know how to hold on to a lover. \"Windmills\" is a metaphorical song about how people spend much of their lives chasing absurd or impossible pursuits  (the allusion being to a specific scene in Don Quixote where the title character uselessly attacks a windmill). The album's artwork (illustrated by artist Jason Holley) also explores Cervantes' windmill metaphor, depicting the incongruence between the way things are and how people tend to perceive them.\nDulcinea also delves into some spiritual themes. \"Fly from Heaven\" is sung from the perspective of James, who is portrayed as Jesus's literal brother and is upset by Paul's manipulation of Jesus's word. \"Begin\" and \"Reincarnation Song\" each explore questions about death and the afterlife.\nGlen Phillips has said that Dulcinea is probably his favorite Toad album because they started to know what they were doing but were not overthinking things yet."

The album was made with the assistance of Phil Kaye, a sound effects virtuoso who worked with Elliott on the Tom and Jerry cartoons.[1]\nThe subtitle that appeared on the front cover of the LP (which also featured three young women striking arguably sultry poses with saxophones and congas atop a cement truck) captured the basic goals, sound, and feel of the album quite well:\n\nA Sonic Spectacular Presenting MUSIC!

A track from the album (\"Will You Still Be Mine\") was later anthologized on one of Rhino Records' influential Cocktail Mix CDs.  As the space age pop/lounge revival grew in popularity, two more tracks from the album (\"You're the Top\" and \"The Lonesome Road\") were anthologized on one of the many volumes of Capitol Records' Ultra-Lounge series.The album was out of print for decades and wasn\u2019t officially available on CD until 2001, when Dutch label Basta Music [2], known for their reissues of Raymond Scott material, released what was described as an official, legitimate CD release of Zounds! transferred directly from the Capitol master tapes.[3]. A few years before that in 1995, a bootleg version was available as a single disc that combined Zounds! What Sounds! with Jack Fascinato's Music From A Surplus Store (1958), another orchestral album with sound effects from the same period with a similar flavor."

The title comes from a line from one of the band's favorite films, the musical West Side Story. As with Pretties for You, the band's debut from the previous year, Easy Action was neither a commercial nor critical success. Singles include \"Shoe Salesman\" and \"Return of the Spiders\".\nDrummer Neal Smith later said of the record producer David Briggs, \"David hated our music and us. I recall the term that he used, referring to our music, was 'Psychedelic Shit'. I think Easy Action sounded too dry, more like a TV or radio commercial and he did not help with song arrangement or positive input in any way.\" None of Easy Action\u2019s songs have ever been performed live by Cooper since the tour in support of their third album Love It to Death; in fact, only \"Return of the Spiders\" was performed on the tour for that album.\nA small number of early U.S. copies were pressed on the blue Bizarre Records label.  These copies carry the same catalog number WS-1845 and album cover as the regular Straight Records release.\nThough perhaps seen as being an overlooked work in terms of later releases, Easy Action tracks \"Mr. & Misdemeanor\" and \"Refrigerator Heaven\" were both later included in the well-received compilation album The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper. \"Refrigerator Heaven\" was also included in the Warner Bros. compilation album Zapped, which showcased acts signed or produced by Frank Zappa. The closing track \"Lay Down And Die, Goodbye\", which was originally written and recorded as a single B-side by the band when it was called Nazz, begins with a sample of Tom Smothers saying \"You are the only censor; if you don't like what I'm saying, you have a choice: you can turn me off\". This is followed by an instrumental jam and finishes with the chorus from the demo. The last part of the song is listed on the Science Fiction album as \"I've Written Home to Mother\", while the instrumental jam section is listed as \"For Alice\" or \"An Instrumental\"."

The album is the follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, in pursuit of a pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is primarily a pop rock record with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R&B-oriented sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.\nBreakaway received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album's new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson's vocal performances. It received several awards and nominations, including winning two Grammy Awards and receiving a nomination for a Juno Award. The album became a commercial success worldwide. By selling over 12 million copies worldwide, Breakaway is Clarkson's best selling album of her career so far, and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 in the United States, it stayed on the top twenty of the chart for more than a year, eventually being certified 6\u00d7 multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of more than six million copies.\nBreakaway's singles \"Since U Been Gone\", \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\", \"Because of You\", \"Walk Away\", and \"Breakaway\" became worldwide hits and have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being certified platinum in over 17 countries. To promote the album, Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. Billboard placed the album 77th in  the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums."

Amos said in an interview that, beginning at age 16, he used drugs every single day and did not let up for years. A music critic for The Guardian described him as a prolific songwriter and as having a \"great voice\". Reviewer Rob Cullivan of the Portland Tribune described Holy Sons' album Survivalist Tales to be an \"ode to the dime novels in the early 1900s that peddled the stories of wilderness explorers,\" and described the music as \"sonic wanderings\" with \"strange song structures\". A review in the Portland Mercury described his music as \"dark, languid psychedelia\" and commented how Amos has \"habitually been kept underground\" with few live performances up until the last few years. His vocals have been compared to Neil Young but change personalities quite often. Willamette Week described the album Decline of the West as \"a varied, meticulously constructed piece of avant-folk that stands alone by its own merits.\""

A downtempo alternative hip hop, pop track combining African folk music elements, the song has a less dance-oriented sound compared to other songs on the album.

While the video proved popular on MTV, the network censored the song's cannabis reference and gunshot sounds. The song was M.I.A.'s biggest commercial success, entering the top 20 on charts in several countries including Denmark and the UK.

Production was handled primarily by the production group  Freakquency , consisting of Badu, Rashad Smith, James Poyser, and RC Williams. Prominently influenced by old-school 1970s and 80s hip hop, soul, R&B and funk elements, the album features an unconventional musical structure; the songwriting took a path of  somewhat less subliminal, metaphorical lyrics than Badu\u2019s previous work, expressing more lighthearted (but sincere) feelings, instead. The album\u2019s content mainly focused on the general state of hip hop culture, reminiscing on good times, friends, partying, young love, \u201chood life\u201d, and some references to gang culture. The album features appearances from artists Dead Prez, Common, Queen Latifah, Bahamadia, and singer Angie Stone.\nThe album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 143,561 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and produced three singles that achieved moderate chart success, while the album was underpromoted and sold less than her previous albums. Upon its release, Worldwide Underground received generally lukewarm reviews from critics. The album has sold 609,000 copies in the United States."

During the five decades of his music career he has recorded 16 studio albums and collections, and 6 live albums. He is also a writer, having published autobiographic and noir novels, and a comics writer. Guccini also worked as actor, soundtrack composer, lexicographer and dialectologist.\nGuccini moved to P\u00e0vana during World War II, then returned to Modena where he spent his teenage years and established his musical career. His debut album, Folk beat n. 1, was released in 1967, but the first success was in 1972 with the album Radici. He was harshly criticised after releasing Stanze di vita quotidiana, and answered his critics with the song \"L'avvelenata\". His studio albums production slowed down in the nineties and 2000s, but his live performances continued being successful.\nHis lyrics have been praised for their poetic and literary value and have been used in schools as an example of modern poetry. Guccini has gained the appreciation of critics and fans, who regard him as an iconic figure. He has received several awards for his works; an asteroid, a cactus species and a butterfly subspecies have been named after him. The main instrument in most of his songs is the acoustic guitar.\nA leftist, though not a communist, Guccini dealt with political issues and more generally with the political climate of his time in some songs, such as \"La locomotiva\" or \"Eskimo\"."

It was the band's final studio album, as they broke up on Halloween 2005. Contrary to the album's title, it is not a \"live\" album but rather a studio recording.\nAlthough the album received generally positive reviews, many consumers were confused by its title and assumed it to be a live album, which in fact it was not. The title was actually a reference to Camp X-Ray, the temporary detention facility located at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Some fans and critics expressed their disappointment at the album's length, stating that a playing time of 26 minutes was not sufficient for a full-length album and that they had expected more creative output from the band. By this time, however, the band's members had drifted heavily into other projects (most notably singer/guitarist John Reis, who was simultaneously playing in Hot Snakes and Sultans and running his record label Swami Records) and were not as creatively dedicated to Rocket as they had been in the past. Cryptic liner notes written by Long Gone John seemed to indicate that the album was a \"last gasp\" of a band in turmoil and that it might be their final album.\nTouring in support of Live from Camp X-Ray was sparse due to the band members' commitments to other projects, and they would perform infrequently over the next few years. In August 2005, after breaking up Hot Snakes, Reis announced that Rocket from the Crypt would play their final performance on Halloween of that year. This confirmed suspicions that Live from Camp X-Ray was the band's final studio album, though posthumous releases of material recorded before their breakup have since been released.\n\"Bring Us Bullets\" is notable for being featured in the film Crank."

After releasing two albums worldwide, Rise from the Ashes (1998) and Eternal Crusade (2000), the band had changed their singer and formed Highland Glory.\nWith a fresh new start and an increased potential, the band developed their style of melodic metal in a heavier and more traditional direction on the debut album, From the Cradle to the Brave (2003). The artwork was created by Mark Wilkinson (famous for his work with Marillion, Fish, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, etc.), who has worked for the band ever since. Still signed to Face Front (the label run by Frode \u00d8ien, chief editor of Scream Magazine) for Scandinavia, but the debut-album was licensed to Massacre Records for the rest of the world. The follow-up \u201cForever Endeavour\u201d (2005) took the different aspects of the band's sound even further, showing a natural, yet darker and more atmospheric progression. In the autumn of 2007 singer Jan Thore Grefstad left the band, and was replaced by Trine Elise Johansen in the winter of 2008. The change from a male to a female singer naturally affected the band's sound, but the trademark still proved to be intact on the album \"Twist of Faith\" (2011), yet the band had developed in a more mid-tempo and even more melodic direction. Having previously only toured their native country, the band finally got to play outside of Norway, in both Sweden and Germany. The band parted ways with singer Trine Elise Johansen, keyboard-player/guitarist Lars Andre Larsen and drummer Morten F\u00e6r\u00f8vig during the autumn and winter of 2011. A year later guitarist Per Olav Olsen, drummer Stian Andre Braathen, keyboard-player Halvor Gustafson and singer H\u00e5vard Indreb\u00f8 finally completed the new line-up, which only lasted a year. The band's original singer Jan Thore Grefstad returned in the winter of 2013, after showcasing his talent in Swedish metal band Saint Deamon, Norske Talenter (Norway's Got Talent) and The Voice \u2013 Norges beste stemme.\nOn January 29, 2017, guitarist Jack Roger Olsen announced his departure from the band via the band's official Facebook page, citing lack of motivation and progress."

Regarding the album's concept, she has described it as the exploration of \"the hunter and the hunted and how both exist within us\" through the story of \"a woman who finds herself in the dying embers of a relationship.\"Night of Hunters is Amos's first studio album recorded using only acoustic instruments, relying solely on her vocals and classically trained piano skills, along with a variety of accompanying string and woodwind instruments, to create its classical sound. Additionally, to record this album Amos broke a nearly 15-year-long collaboration with her studio and touring bandmates, choosing to work with a variety of new musicians, including the Berlin Philharmonic's principal clarinetist, Andreas Ottensamer, and the award-winning string quartet, Apollon Musag\u00e8te, while enlisting her daughter, Natashya Hawley, and niece, Kelsey Dobyns, as guest vocalists. Night of Hunters also marks the twentieth anniversary of her long-time collaboration with John Philip Shenale, who has contributed arrangements to most of her albums, beginning with her solo debut, Little Earthquakes (1992).\nThe album is Amos' first release on a classical music label. Like her previous releases, it is available in both standard and deluxe CD formats, digital format, as well as limited edition vinyl. Amos also released an entirely instrumental version of the album entitled Night of Hunters \u2013 Sin Palabras (without words) available only to download.\nThe main promotional single released from the album is \"Carry\", a variation on La fille aux cheveux de lin by Debussy."

The album maintained the band's heavy metal sound, while featuring an increased focus on songwriting compared to the band's previous releases. AllMusic considered the album's music to be \"surprisingly cerebral and arty\"; alternative tunings and odd time signatures were present on several of the album's songs, and lyrics were intended to be ambiguous and evocative.\nThe focus on the Seattle grunge scene helped bring attention to Badmotorfinger, and the singles \"Outshined\" and \"Rusty Cage\" found a major audience in rock radio and MTV. Badmotorfinger became the band's highest charting album at the time on the Billboard 200, where it peaked at number 39. The album received critical acclaim, citing the significant improvements over earlier releases and evolution in the band's sound. Soundgarden supported the album with tours of North America and Europe, including opening for Guns N' Roses on the Use Your Illusion Tour. In 1992, Badmotorfinger was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1996."

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo.\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album Here I Am (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro mixed the song, focusing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Takes Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to Coldplay's 2002 hit single \"Clocks\".\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from One Love. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest-charting single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on Billboard's Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, Billboard named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging electronic dance music trend in America at its time of release.\nIn the song's accompanying music video, Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, NRJ Music Awards and the World Music Awards. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual Miss Universe competition. The single earned several Platinum and Gold certifications, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide. Additionally, it earned Guetta two Grammy Award nominations for \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\"."

It was released as the fourth single from the album on February 25, 1988. The song was written by Frank Wildhorn and Chuck Jackson and produced by Narada Michael Walden. A pop ballad set in the key of D major, the record is about someone seeking for a former lover to return after a breakup. Upon its release, the song received mixed reviews from critics. \nThe song helped Houston to set an all-time chart record on the Billboard Hot 100, in which it became Houston's seventh consecutive number one single on the chart, beating the record of six, previously held by The Beatles and The Bee Gees. As of 2024, the record still holds. It also made Houston just the second artist to land four number one singles off one album after Michael Jackson had set the record with his Bad album and made her the first female artist to do so.\nBoth the song and the song's music video, directed by Peter Israelson, received some negative reaction from some members of Houston's core black audience who accused the singer of \"selling out\". Houston would later perform the song in full on her Moment of Truth World Tour, while in later tours such as the I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour and The Bodyguard World Tour, portions of the song was included in a \"Love Medley\" segment, usually near the end of the medley."

Originally a continuation of the sound of predecessor Tubthumper (1997), the group scrapped the material from the album's initial recording sessions and sought to explore new sounds with WYSIWYG. The album incorporates elements of pop, dance-pop, alternative rock, and experimental music. Thematically, the album explores various aspects of pop culture that the group had been exposed to due to the success of their 1997 single \"Tubthumping\". WYSIWYG was promoted with one single: \"She's Got All the Friends That Money Can Buy\".\nWYSIWYG received polarized reviews from music critics. Some music critics praised the album's catchy hooks and references to pop culture, while others criticized the album for being dull and lacking cohesion. The album was met with some controversy due to the song \"Passenger List for Doomed Flight #1721\", a B-side to \"She's Got All the Friends That Money Can Buy\" and bonus track on the album, in which the group names off prominent public figures that they wish would disappear on an astray flight. In a stark contrast to Tubthumper, the album failed to attain any notable commercial success, failing to chart on any major music charts. Following the commercial failure of WYSIWYG, Chumbawamba parted ways with EMI in 2001."

The duo were dressed in matching black suits, black pencil ties, black trilby hats and black sunglasses. The band itself was carefully constructed, and made up of experienced musicians of the time, including Steve \"The Colonel\" Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy, \"Blue\" Lou Marini, Tom \"Bones\" Malone, and Alan \"Mr. Fabulous\" Rubin.\nIn 1978, the band released their debut album, Briefcase Full of Blues, which was a recording of their original appearance with Steve Martin.  Several subsequent albums followed.  The act opened for the Grateful Dead at the closing of Winterland Arena in San Francisco, and gained further fame after spawning the Hollywood comedy film The Blues Brothers in 1980.

Their stated goal is to use their music to bring ancient history and mythology into the modern era especially to build awareness of the myths of Taiwan and tragic events in that country's history (for example, those experienced by the Seediq people).Since 2011 their trademark erhu has been complemented with stringed instruments including the koto and shamisen, as well as Tibetan Bells and shakuhachi and Seediq hunting flutes (Chinese: \u7375\u9996\u7b1b), the latter of which are traditionally used by the aboriginal people of Taiwan. The band members are also acclaimed artists and political activists who advocate independence for Taiwan and self-determination for Tibetans and Uighurs. Singer Freddy Lim served as Chairman of the Taiwan chapter of Amnesty International from 2010 to 2014 and has been a legislator since 2016, first representing the New Power Party before becoming an independent. Since their formation, Chthonic has released eight studio albums. The most recent of which, Battlefields of Asura, was released in October 2018."

The album's release was preceded by the departure of the group's longest-standing member Carmit Bachar. Development began in February 2008 where the group worked with previous collaborators Sean Garrett, Polow da Don and Timbaland and new ones such as Darkchild, J-Roc and Chase N. Cashe. Polow da Don, R. Kelly and Snoop Dogg also make guest performances on the album. Several songs on Doll Domination were originally recorded for the lead singer Nicole Scherzinger's debut solo album, Her Name is Nicole, which was shelved after the under-performance of its preceding singles.\nThe album consists of a mixture of pop and R&B songs that also blend elements of dance, electropop with lyrics that tackle fame, sexuality and relationships. All of the lead and background vocals were sung by Scherzinger with support from Melody Thornton, whilst the remaining group members are only credited for background vocals. Upon release, Doll Domination received mixed reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 becoming the group's highest charting album. It experienced similar peaks in international territories, debuting at number three in Canada and number four in Australia and the United Kingdom. Doll Domination was later reissued in multiple versions throughout 2009. The album was supported with a world tour titled Doll Domination Tour in 2009.\nThe album was preceded by the release of the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single \"When I Grow Up\" and the UK top-ten hit \"Whatcha Think About That\" (featuring Missy Elliott). Other successful singles were \"I Hate This Part\", \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\", and \"Hush Hush; Hush Hush\", all of which reached the top ten in numerous countries worldwide. Although \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\" became a number-one hit in Australia, Ireland, Finland, among other countries, the single caused tension within the group as Scherzinger was billed as a featured artist. Despite their commercial success, unhappiness of Scherzinger's spotlight and prominence within the group grew leading to a public outburst by Thornton during the tour. In early 2010, the group disbanded to pursue solo projects, before reforming in 2019 with the promise of new music. In 2019, the R. Kelly collaboration \"Out of This Club\" was removed from digital retailers and streaming services, following the airing of the Surviving R. Kelly documentary and subsequent abuse allegations against the singer."

He then made the cross-county transition to Broadway, appearing in Kid Boots (1923), the Ziegfeld Follies of 1924, Ziegfeld Follies of 1925, and Good News (1927).George Olsen and his orchestra were in Eddie Cantor's 1928 Broadway hit Whoopee!, and in the 1930 movie version. In the Follies George met a singer, Ethel Shutta, who sings and dances memorably in Whoopee!, and they married, appearing together in nightclubs and on radio. They had two children, George Jr. and Charles; following a divorce, Olsen opened a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey. Olsen and Shutta were heard on the Oldsmobile Program on CBS radio in 1933. He also was an orchestra leader for The Jack Benny Program on radio.\nOlsen signed with Victor in 1924 and remained as one of Victor's most popular bands until 1933 when he signed with Columbia. He stayed with Columbia through January, 1934. He recorded a single session in 1938 for Decca, and one final date for the rare Varsity label in 1940.\nOlsen's bands produced few stars. Singer-saxophonist Fred MacMurray passed through in 1930 on his way to eventual movie stardom, recording a vocal on I'm in the Market for You. Olsen's long-time alto saxist and singer, Fran Frey, with his distinctive, reedy bass-baritone, was perhaps the best known Olsenite until he left in 1933 for a career as a music director in radio.\nIn 1936, Olsen became leader of Orville Knapp's band after Knapp died in a plane crash. Olsen was chosen to lead the band by Knapp's widow. Morale problems plagued the group, and in 1938, after many musicians had already left, the group disbanded.\nA resident of Paramus, New Jersey, Olsen ran a popular local restaurant there on Paramus Road for many years before he died there on March 18, 1971. According to John S. Wilson in The New York Times, reviewing a retrospective of Olsen's recording \"George Olsen and His Music\" on RCA-Victor, in 1968, Olsen had a restaurant in Paramus, New Jersey, called \"George Olsen's\". Wilson noted that \"Olsen is there every day greeting guests at lunch and dinner... In the background, the original George Olsen records of the Twenties play softly.After his divorce from Shutta, Olsen married Claralee Pilcer."

Hamza composed some of his own work, like the album heads Esmaani and Insan, along with some collaborations with other artists, like Maher Zain's song Ya Nabi Salam Alayka. He also contributed to arranging the cartoony remake Egyptian Jingle Bells (also known as Oh la la song), which was the first shaabi work in his repertoire, later followed by Esta3izo in his fourth studio album.Hamza's work is mostly marked by a recurring sociopolitical theme, diverting from love songs and focusing on topics of general humanist interest, like hope, alienation, generational change, and oppression. He's also interested in reviving cultural heritage. Having been dubbed \"Voice of the Revolution\", works of Hamza rose to prominence during the 25 January revolution, in which he personally participated, and was considered a symbolic figure thereof.

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in February 1979 in the United States by Capricorn Records and PolyGram Records elsewhere. The Allman Brothers Band had broken up in 1976 following internal turmoil, amplified by escalating drug use. The band members splintered into different acts \u2014 among those Great Southern, Sea Level, and the Gregg Allman Band. Guitarist Dickey Betts approached his bandmates in 1978 with the prospects of a reunion. It is the first to feature guitarist Dan Toler and bassist David Goldflies. Living together in Sarasota, Florida, they rehearsed and wrote the material for their next album in fall 1978.\nThey began recording Enlightened Rogues that December, and recording stretched into the new year. Sessions took place in Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, with producer Tom Dowd, who worked on a trio of early Allman Brothers albums. The group stayed at a home overlooking Biscayne Bay, which promoted unity within the members. The recording process was smooth and pleasant, with members showing courtesy to one another in comparison to ill feelings felt earlier. The album's title comes from a quote original guitarist Duane Allman used to describe the band: \"The world is made of two great schools, enlightened rogues and religious fools.\"\nThe album was a commercial success in the United States, peaking at #9 and earning a RIAA gold certification. \"Crazy Love\" was the group's second of three Top 40 hits, reaching #29. Despite this, Capricorn would file for bankruptcy that fall, leading the Allman Brothers to sign to Arista Records."

Although the band was not initially successful, they quickly earned a dedicated cult following and have been retrospectively praised for their pioneering innovation in several genres related to folk music. They also proved to be influential, both during their initial run and to a new generation of musicians like Yo La Tengo and Espers.As the Holy Modal Rounders, Stampfel and Weber began playing in Greenwich Village, at the heart of the ongoing American folk music revival. Their sense of humor, irreverent attitude, and novel update of old-time music brought support from fellow musicians but also caused controversy amongst folk purists in the scene. In 1964, the Rounders made history with their self-titled debut, which included the first use of \"psychedelic\" in popular music. After their first two studio albums, the duo briefly joined the newly formed underground rock band the Fugs in 1965 and helped record the band's influential debut album. \nFollowing their exit from the Fugs, the duo released two albums that experimented with psychedelic folk before they expanded their lineup to a full rock band by the end of 1968. The Holy Modal Rounders' expanded lineup notably included famed playwright Sam Shepard as a drummer and later guitarist Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter (amongst others) before stabilizing in 1971, with a band that would later back Jeffrey Frederick as the Clamtones. In 1972, Weber relocated the band to Portland, Oregon, while Stampfel stayed behind in New York. Although Stampfel would describe Weber as his \"long lost brother,\" they often had a hostile relationship and the two would only reunite sporadically following the band's Portland move. After Weber returned to the East Coast in 1995, the duo began a series of concert reunions starting in 1996 before breaking up for the last time in 2003."

Other singles released achieved major success, including \"Water Runs Dry\", which reached No. 2, and \"Thank You\", which reached No. 21. \"Vibin'\", however, only reached No. 52.The spoken track \"Khalil (Interlude)\" is a tribute to their road manager, Roderick \"Khalil\" Rountree, who, in May 1992, was shot and killed in Chicago, Illinois while the group was opening for MC Hammer's Too Legit to Quit tour. II became the inaugural winner of the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, first presented at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995. In 2020, it was ranked number 495 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nAccording to producer Bob Robinson of the duo Tim & Bob, he and his partner Tim Kelley were asked by Boyz II Men to produce most of II. However, Motown Records then-president Jheryl Busby did not feel comfortable with the idea of two unknown producers dominating a second album from a group that was one of the biggest acts in the world at the time. As a result, Busby brought in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Babyface to deliver hit singles for the project. Busby insisted on \"I'll Make Love to You\" being the first single, despite objections from the group- who felt there were songs that could have been much stronger singles. The song became one of Boyz II Men's biggest hits.\nOver 20 songs were recorded for II, but most of them never made the final track listing. Two of the songs Tim & Bob produced\u2014\"Now That We're Done\" and \"Can I Touch You\"\u2014ended up on 112's 1996 self-titled debut."

With Petula Hatch again became Clark's exclusive producer overseeing all the album's tracks. Petula would prove to be the last Petula Clark album of original material produced by Hatch.The first advance single from Petula: the Les Reed/Barry Mason composition \"Kiss Me Goodbye\" had reached #15 US in April 1968, becoming the first hit single for Clark produced but not written by Hatch. Of the eleven additional tracks which would comprise Petula, seven were written by Hatch and Jackie Trent. Hatch also had Clark cover \"Days\", \"The Good Life\" and \"This Girl's in Love with You\" and recorded Clark singing \"Why Can't I Cry\" which had been written by arranger Johnny Harris and wife Kim Clark. The song was also recorded by Tom Jones.\nThe Hatch/Trent composition \"Don't Give Up\" - described by Hatch as a homage to \"Can't Take My Eyes off You\"\n- was released as the album's second advance single in July 1968 and failed to sustain Clark's Top 20 comeback peaking at #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Clark's final US Top 40 hit.2 \"Billboard\" reported that \"Don't Give Up\" was one of the most requested tunes at Las Vegas' Desert Inn Sky Room as of late 1968 and early 1969. Singer-pianist Murray Arnold claimed it was behind only \"Didn't We\" and \"Little Green Apples.\"\nThe track \"Have Another Dream On Me\" was referred to as \"my latest\" by Clark on her April 1968 NBC TV special. For reasons unclear, the song never came out on single, but \"Don't Give Up\" did.\nPetula rose significantly higher on the US album charts than the preceding The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener reaching #51 as opposed to #93.\nClark's UK label Pye Records released the album in the UK and Ireland (cat# NPL 18235) and also in New Zealand (cat# NSPL 18235). In France the Petula album was issued by Vogue Records with cat# CLD 723.\n\n1The titles of the singles \"Kiss Me Goodbye\" and \"Don't Give Up\" were displayed with the name \"Petula\" on the album's cover but the official title of the album is simply Petula.\n2\"Don't Give Up\" ranked in the Top 30 in both Cash Box and Record World with respective peaks of #27 and #23. The track reached #5 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart."

His harmonica playing first gained attention in the 1960s, when he was a duet partner with the guitarist and singer Mississippi Fred McDowell. They recorded together for the music historian George Mitchell in 1967, for Chris Strachwitz's Arhoolie Records (King of the Country Blues Vol. 2), for Swingmaster (Blues of Johnny Woods) and as a solo for Tom Pomposello and Fred Seibert of Oblivion Records (\"Mississippi Harmonica\") in 1972.Stylistically, Woods's music sprang from the same north Mississippi fife-and-drum blues tradition as McDowell's. However, personal problems kept him rooted in the Delta, primarily working as a farmhand and sharecropper.\nAfter McDowell's death in July 1973, Woods faded into obscurity until George Mitchell paired him again with another Mitchell discovery from the Mississippi Delta, R. L. Burnside, himself a McDowell disciple. They recorded the Swingmaster album and video Going Down South.\nWoods died in Olive Branch, Mississippi, in 1990."

The duo had risen to fame two years prior with the albums Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme and the soundtrack album for the 1967 film The Graduate.\nBookends is a concept album that explores a life journey from childhood to old age. Side one of the album marks successive stages in life, the theme serving as bookends to the life cycle. Side two largely consists of previously-released singles and of unused material for The Graduate soundtrack. Simon's lyrics concern youth, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality. Much of the material was crafted alongside producer John Simon (no relation), who joined the recording when Paul Simon suffered from writer's block. The album was recorded gradually over the period of a year, with production speeding up around the later months of 1967.\nInitial sales for Bookends were substantial in the US, and the album produced the number-one single \"Mrs. Robinson\". The album sold well in the US and in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number one. Bookends was considered a breakthrough for the duo, placing them on the same level as artists such as Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones at the forefront of the countercultural movement in the 1960s. The album has continued to receive critical acclaim and is often debated by critics as to whether it or Bridge Over Troubled Water is Simon & Garfunkel's best album."
