McKee was one of many ballplayers who appeared in the Major Leagues only during World War II. He made his major league debut on August 18, 1943, in a home doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals at Shibe Park. The best game of his short career, however, came on October 3, 1943, the last day of the season, when he started the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field and pitched a complete game, winning 11\u20133. The losing pitcher was Cookie Cuccurullo, who was making his major league debut. Then, at 17, McKee became the youngest pitcher in the 20th century to throw a nine-inning complete-game victory on the final day of the regular season, a feat no one has accomplished since. McKee made his last pitching appearance for the Phillies on September 26, 1944. Overall, he posted a 1\u20130 record and a 5.87 earned run average in five games (one start), allowing 10 runs on 14 hits and six walks, while striking out one in 151\u20443 innings of work.

In 2014, McKee died in his hometown of Shelby, North Carolina, 15 days short before of his 88th birthday."

He played as a defensive midfielder for several clubs, in France, Italy, England and Spain, namely Marseille, Juventus, Chelsea and Valencia, as well as Nantes and Bordeaux. Nicknamed \"the water-carrier\" (French: le porteur d'eau) by former France teammate Eric Cantona, Deschamps was an intelligent and hard-working defensive midfielder who excelled at winning back possession and subsequently starting attacking plays, and also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. As a French international, he was capped on 103 occasions and took part at three UEFA European Football Championships and one FIFA World Cup, captaining his nation to victories in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.\nIn addition to winning two Division 1 titles in 1990 and 1992, Deschamps was part of the Marseille squad that became the first, and so far only, French club to win the UEFA Champions League, a feat which the team achieved in 1993; with the Champions League victory, Deschamps became the youngest captain ever to lead his team to win the title. With Juventus he played three Champions League finals in a row between 1996 and 1998, winning the title in 1996. With the Turin side, he also won the UEFA Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup, as well as three Serie A titles, among other trophies. With Chelsea, he won the 1999\u20132000 FA Cup, and also reached another Champions League final with Valencia in 2001, before retiring later that season. After Franz Beckenbauer and followed by Iker Casillas, he was only the second captain in the history of football to have lifted the Champions League trophy, the World Cup trophy, and the European Championship trophy.As a manager, Deschamps began his career with Monaco, and helped the club to win the Coupe de la Ligue in 2003, and reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, being named Ligue 1 Manager of the Year in 2004. During the 2006\u201307 season, he helped his former club Juventus win the Serie B title and return to Serie A following their relegation due to their involvement in the 2006 Calciopoli Scandal the previous season. He subsequently managed another one of his former clubs, Marseille, where he won the Ligue 1 title during the 2009\u201310 season, as well as three consecutive Coupe de la Ligue titles between 2010 and 2012, and consecutive Troph\u00e9e des Champions titles in 2010 and 2011.\nOn 8 July 2012, Deschamps was named as the new manager of the French national team. He led the team to the quarter-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the final of UEFA Euro 2016, victory in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and a back-to-back final appearance in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Upon winning the World Cup in 2018, Deschamps became the third man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager, alongside M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer\u2014both of whom died in January 2024 two days apart, leaving Deschamps the only living man to have reached the milestone. Deschamps follows Beckenbauer as only the second to do so as captain."

He also amassed a total of 35 caps for the Northern Ireland national football team. Following his playing career, he went into management, taking charge of various clubs in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nJackson began his professional football career playing for Glentoran. He became a regular in the Glentoran side by the age of 21, and won league-winners' medals in 1967 and 1968 before signing for Everton in February 1968. In just over two seasons with the Toffees, Jackson picked up yet another league-winners' medal in 1970. His performances as understudy to the likes of Alan Ball and Howard Kendall attracted the attention of other clubs and, after just 32 league appearances for Everton, Jackson was signed by Nottingham Forest in October 1970.\nForest were struggling for survival in the First Division, but Jackson still only managed to make 81 appearances, albeit scoring six goals. The arrival of Brian Clough and the emergence of Martin O'Neill saw Jackson's opportunities become even fewer and further between, and he was granted a free transfer in the summer of 1975. He was then signed by Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty with the intention of Jackson captaining the club's reserve team and instilling a level of professionalism in the club, which had just been promoted back into the First Division. However, Jackson made such a good impression that he was rewarded with 17 league starts that season, helping the team to an impressive third-place finish. Nevertheless, he spent the 1976\u201377 season back in his intended reserve team role before retiring back to Ireland to become the player-manager at Waterford United. There, he led the club to two consecutive FAI Cup finals, winning the competition in 1980.\nDespite the FAI Cup win, one trophy in four years was not enough for the Waterford United board, and Jackson was sacked in 1982. It was a whole year before he got another management job, returning to Northern Ireland as manager of Crusaders in July 1983. The team won the Gold Cup in 1985, beating Linfield 2\u20131 in the final, but Jackson left the club in October of the following season, before returning to his first club, Glentoran, three months later. In 6+1\u20442 years at Glentoran, Jackson led the team to 16 major trophies, including the Double in 1988, but the team's form began to dip after their title win in 1992, and Jackson was sacked in July 1993. He then spent a further year in charge of Ballymena United."

Known by his nickname as El Sid, he finished his career with 114 wins, was a two-time All-Star, and helped the Mets win the World Series in 1986.\nBorn in Honolulu, Hawaii, Fernandez was proud of his roots and wore uniform number 50 in honor of Hawaii being the 50th state. The theme song to Hawaii Five-O was often played before his starts at Shea Stadium during his days with the Mets.\nFernandez had an unorthodox pitching motion with a hesitation at the end, followed by a sudden slingshot sidearm delivery. This deceptive motion, coupled with an effective curveball and a rising fastball, made him a major strikeout threat throughout his career. Fernandez's strikeouts were often commemorated by Mets' fans in the upper deck putting up taped signs marked with the letter \"S\" for Sid.\nFernandez has the fourth-lowest ratio of hits allowed per innings pitched in Major League history, behind only Nolan Ryan, Clayton Kershaw, and Sandy Koufax."

Due to a farm-machinery accident in his youth (April 17, 1888), Brown lost parts of two fingers on his right hand, and in the process gained a colorful nickname. He turned this handicap into an advantage by learning how to grip a baseball in a way that resulted in an exceptional curveball (or knuckle curve), which broke radically before reaching the plate. With this technique he became one of the elite pitchers of his era.\nBrown was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949."

He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers, and the Vancouver Canucks. In 2022, Luongo was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Luongo is a two-time NHL All-Star (2004 and 2007) and a winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals against average in the league (2011, with backup Cory Schneider). He was a finalist for several awards, including the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender (2004, 2007, and 2011), the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by his peers (2004 and 2007), and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (2007). Luongo is second all time in games played as an NHL goaltender (1,044) and fourth all time in wins (489). He employed the butterfly style of goaltending.Born in Montreal, Quebec, Luongo is of Italian and Irish ancestry. Prior to his NHL career, he played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Val-d'Or Foreurs and the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, winning back-to-back President's Cups and establishing the league's all-time play-off records in games played and wins. Following his second QMJHL season, Luongo was selected fourth overall by the Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. After splitting his professional rookie season between the Islanders and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1999\u20132000, he was traded to the Panthers. In five seasons with Florida, Luongo established team records for most games played, wins and shutouts; despite several strong seasons, however, the Panthers remained a weak team and were unable to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs during Luongo's initial stint with the team. During the 2006 off-season, he was traded to the Canucks after failed contract negotiations with the Panthers.\nIn his first season in Vancouver, Luongo won 47 games, and was runner-up in voting for both the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and Vezina Trophy (best goaltender). Following his second year with the Canucks, he became the first NHL goaltender to serve as a team captain since Bill Durnan in the 1947\u201348 season. Luongo served in that capacity for two seasons before resigning from the position in September 2010. In the subsequent 2010\u201311 season, he helped the Canucks to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals but lost to the Boston Bruins. During his eight-year tenure with Vancouver, Luongo became the team's all-time leader in wins and shutouts. He returned to the Panthers during the 2013\u201314 season, where he spent the remainder of his career, qualifying for the playoffs with the Panthers only once during that time. He was the last active goaltender to have played in the NHL in the 1990s.\nInternationally, Luongo has competed for Team Canada in numerous tournaments. As a junior, he won a silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships, while being named Best Goaltender in his second tournament appearance. Luongo won two gold medals at the 2003 and 2004 World Championships and a silver in the 2005 World Championships. He also won the 2004 World Cup championship and appeared in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin as a backup to Martin Brodeur in both instances. He succeeded Brodeur as Canada's starting goaltender during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, winning a gold medal. On January 7, 2014, he was named to the 2014 Canadian Olympic hockey team, where he won his second Olympic gold medal in a largely backup role to Carey Price."

Butkus was renowned as a fierce tackler and for the relentless effort with which he played.

He was a linebacker and a center for the Illinois Fighting Illini. He was a twice consensus All-American, and he led the Illini to a Rose Bowl victory in 1963 and was deemed the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference. Butkus was named college football's Lineman of the Year in 1964. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.\nButkus was selected by the Bears as the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL draft. He soon established himself as a ball hawk with his penchant for forcing turnovers. During his NFL career, he intercepted 22 passes and recovered 27 fumbles (a record when he retired), and he was responsible for causing many more fumbles with his jarring tackles. His tackling ability earned him both admiration and trepidation from opposing players. In 2009, the NFL Network named Butkus the most feared tackler of all time.\nButkus is credited with having defined the middle linebacker position and is still viewed as the \"gold standard by which other middle linebackers are measured\". In his honor, the Butkus Award recognizes American football's most outstanding linebacker. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, and his No. 51 jersey was retired by the Bears. Following his playing career, Butkus worked in acting, sports commentary, and celebrity endorsement. He was active in philanthropy through the Butkus Foundation, which manages various charitable causes."

He was selected with the second pick of the sixth round of the 1999 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for the Detroit Lions in 2004. He was the leading receiver for the national champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team.\nIn high school, he was an All-American in football and as a senior led his team to a 9\u20130 regular season before losing in the playoffs. In basketball, he was an All-State selection by numerous publications and led his team past Kevin Garnett's high school team to reach the finals of the state championship playoff tournament. Despite losing in the finals, he was the highest votegetter on the All-tournament team.  In track, he was a state long jump champion as a junior and runner-up as a senior when he also helped his school's 4 x 400 metres relay team finish third in the state. In 1995, he was widely regarded as the best high school athlete in the Chicago metropolitan area, winning athlete of the year awards from the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times and Illinois High School Association.  He is considered to be one of the greatest three-sport athletes in the history of Illinois.Streets led the Michigan Wolverines football team in receiving yards each season from 1996 to 1998.  He had two touchdown receptions in the 1998 Rose Bowl, which clinched a share of the national championship.  During his years as the primary receiver, there were quarterback controversies each year with battles among Brian Griese, Scott Dreisbach, Tom Brady and Drew Henson. As a senior, he was voted football team MVP and All-Big Ten Conference second-team wide receiver.  That season, he posted five 100-yard games and totaled over one thousand yards.  He played in the Senior Bowl and was selected for the Hula Bowl.  He was injured right before the 1999 draft causing him to slip from a projected second-round selection to a sixth-round choice.  As a sophomore, he played part of the season for the 1996\u201397 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team, which won the 1997 National Invitation Tournament, but has since vacated the championship due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.\nStreets had modest success as a professional in five seasons with the 49ers.  He began as a fourth wide receiver on a team with perennial Pro Bowl receivers Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens, but he eventually became a starter before moving on to play his final season with the Lions.  His career was highlighted by playoff performances in which he caught at least four receptions for at least 50 yards in all three playoff games.  He recorded two fourth quarter playoff touchdowns one of which was the game-winner in a 24-point comeback victory and the other of which was a game-tying touchdown in a losing effort."

In 109 MLB games (27 as a starting pitcher) and 301+2\u20443 innings pitched, Calvert allowed 345 hits and 158 bases on balls. He struck out 102, threw five complete games and earned five saves.\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Calvert broke into professional baseball in 1938. He spent most of the year playing in the Quebec Provincial League, at the time a minor league unaffiliated with MLB. He then played in three games for the Montreal Royals, and showed enough promise that the New York Giants gave him a tryout, but they passed on signing him as they felt he needed more experience.  After spending 1939 out of organized baseball, Calvert was signed by the Cleveland Indians organization to a contract in 1940, and was invited to spring training. He then spent the season with the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League and the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League, playing in 21 total games for the two teams. He spent 1941 with Cedar Rapids, and finished the year with six wins, three losses, and a 2.39 earned run average (ERA) in 11 games.He signed with the Cleveland organization and in 1942 he won 17 of 24 decisions with a 2.22 ERA with Wilkes-Barre. That led to his call up to the Indians' roster when he made his MLB debut with two scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox on September 24 in his only major league appearance of the season.Calvert spent three full seasons\u20141944, 1949, and 1950\u2014in the big leagues. His most notable campaign, 1949 with the Senators, saw him lead the American League in games lost (17) and in pitchers' fielding percentage (1.000 in 55 chances). His minor league career essentially ended after the 1952 season, although he got into three games in 1955 with the Class C Modesto Reds."

Rivaldo is regarded as one of the greatest, most skillful, and most creative players of all time. He was renowned for his bending free kicks, bicycle kicks, feints, powerful ball striking from distance, and ability to both score and create goals. In 1999, he won the Ballon d'Or and was named FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. With success at club and international level, he is one of nine players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or. \nRivaldo started his career in 1991 with Brazilian club Santa Cruz, going on to have spells at Mogi Mirim, a loan spell at Corinthians, and Palmeiras.

At Barcelona, he formed a successful partnership with Dutch international Patrick Kluivert, and won consecutive La Liga titles in 1998 and 1999, as well as the 1998 Copa del Rey. Rivaldo notably scored a hattrick against Valencia in June 2001 which qualified Barcelona for the 2001-02 UEFA Champions League; the last goal was a last minute 20-yard bicycle kick winner and the hattrick itself is often ranked as the greatest ever. During his five-year tenure there, he scored 130 goals, ranking him among Barcelona's highest goalscorers of all time. \nIn 2002, Rivaldo signed for Italian club A.C. Milan, winning the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Champions League in his only season there, however, his performances were underwhelming and he cancelled his contract with Milan in late 2004. He went on to play for Cruzeiro, Olympiacos, AEK Athens, Bunyodkor, a loan spell at S\u00e3o Paulo, Kabuscorp and S\u00e3o Caetano. In March 2014, Rivaldo announced his retirement from professional football, however since June 2015 he made appearances for Mogi Mirim, before retiring again in August 2015.\nFrom 1993 to 2003, Rivaldo played 74 matches and scored 35 goals for Brazil and is the seventh highest goalscorer for the country. He helped Brazil reach the final of the 1998 FIFA World Cup and won the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica where he was named player of the tournament. Rivaldo starred in an attacking trio with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho in the 2002 FIFA World Cup winning team.

That season's state title run was later chronicled in a book entitled Teamwork: Ashland's 1961 Championship Basketball Season; it is considered one of the greatest high school teams in state history. Sergent then enrolled at Morehead State to play for the Eagles for four years. He became a star, and after averaging an Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) leading 20.4 points per game during his sophomore campaign, was named the OVC Player of the Year. Sergent was also honored with numerous all-conference and All-America honors throughout his collegiate career, and by the time he graduated in 1965 he had scored 1,469 points. His career 23.2 points per game average is second all-time at Morehead State.\nAfter college, Sergent played for the Phillips 66 Oilers (commonly known as the Phillips 66ers) in the Amateur Athletic Union, which at the time was the premier amateur basketball league in the United States. Playing in the AAU allowed players to still compete in international competitions such as the Olympic Games because professional athletes were not allowed to participate.

He played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills, and is regarded as one of the greatest running backs of all time. Once a popular figure with the American public, Simpson's professional success was overshadowed by his trial and controversial acquittal for the murders of his former wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\nSimpson played college football for the USC Trojans, where he won the Heisman Trophy as a senior, and was selected first overall by the Bills in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft. During his nine seasons with the Bills, Simpson received five consecutive Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro selections from 1972 to 1976. He also led the league in rushing yards four times, in rushing touchdowns twice, and in points scored in 1975. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, earning him NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP), and is the only NFL player to do so in a 14-game regular season. Simpson holds the record for the single-season yards-per-game average at 143.1. After retiring with the San Francisco 49ers in 1979, Simpson pursued an acting and broadcasting career. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985.\nIn June 1994, Simpson was arrested and charged with the murders of Brown and Goldman. He was acquitted in a lengthy and internationally publicized trial, but found liable for the deaths three years later in a civil suit from the victims' families. To date, Simpson has paid little of the $33.5 million judgment (equivalent to $64 million in 2023).\nIn 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with armed robbery and kidnapping. In 2008, he was convicted and sentenced to 33 years' imprisonment, with a minimum of nine years without parole. He served his sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center near Lovelock, Nevada. He was granted parole on July 20, 2017, which was the minimum sentence. He was released on October 1, 2017. In December 2021, Simpson was granted early release from his parole by the Nevada Division of Parole and Probation."

He played six seasons in the NFL, one for the Pittsburgh Steelers and five for the Kansas City Chiefs.  As a collegian, he played wide receiver at the University of Texas, catching a total of 56 passes for 921 yards, 11 touchdowns, and had 2 incompletions credited as touchdowns over four seasons. He is best remembered at UT for catching the game-winning touchdown pass on 4th down from Texas quarterback Peter Gardere in a rivalry game against Oklahoma which enabled UT to win the game 14-13 in 1990.\nCash was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the seventh round of the 1991 NFL Draft, but was released before the start of the season. He signed on with Pittsburgh and played in five games with them, catching 7 passes.  In 1992, he signed with the Chiefs and spent the rest of his career there.  His best season was in 1995, when he caught 42 passes for 419 yards.\nTwo of his most memorable NFL receptions were touchdown passes from Joe Montana. One was in Montana's first game against his former team, the San Francisco 49ers. The other was a 7-yard pass which was the Chiefs' first touchdown in a 28\u201320 divisional round victory over the Houston Oilers at the Astrodome on January 16, 1994. Cash finished the play by firing the football at an image of Oilers defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan's face on a banner hanging beyond the end zone. Holding no grudge against Ryan, he explained, \"I saw it as I was crossing the goal line, and it was just impulse. I just let it fly.\""

The play has since been referred to as \"The Fumble\" by Giants fans and \"The Miracle at the Meadowlands\" by Eagles fans, and it was instrumental in making the Quarterback kneel (also known as \"taking a knee\") a routine play for running down the clock at the end of a game.\nPisarcik was traded to the Eagles in 1980 for a sixth round pick, primarily serving as the backup to QB Ron Jaworski.

Baseball historians consider Gibson among the best power hitters and catchers in baseball history. In 1972, he became the second Negro league player to be inducted in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.Gibson played for the Homestead Grays from 1930 to 1931, moved to the Pittsburgh Crawfords from 1932 to 1936, and returned to the Grays from 1937 to 1939 and 1942 to 1946. In 1937, he played for Ciudad Trujillo in Trujillo's Dominican League and from 1940 to 1941, he played in the Mexican League for Azules de Veracruz. Gibson served as the first manager of the Cangrejeros de Santurce, one of the most historic franchises of the Puerto Rico Baseball League.\nGibson was known as a spectacular power hitter who, by some accounts, hit close to 800 career home runs.  (In the Negro League statistical records, his career HR total was 166.)  He was known as the \"black Babe Ruth\"; in fact, some fans at the time who saw both Ruth and Gibson play called Ruth \"the white Josh Gibson\". Gibson never played in the Major Leagues because of the unwritten \"gentleman's agreement\" that prevented non-white players from participating. He stood 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and weighed 210 lb (95 kg) at the peak of his career. He was the first player since Oscar Charleston to win consecutive batting Triple Crowns (leading the league in home runs, runs batted in, batting average) and no batter has achieved the feat since.\nOn December 16, 2020, Major League Baseball announced that it will recognize Negro league records, giving Gibson the second-highest single-season major league batting average at .466 (1943)."

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL draft, and spent six seasons in the NFL as a journeyman quarterback. Kafka became the quarterbacks coach for the Chiefs in 2018, and Patrick Mahomes, the starting quarterback for the Chiefs, earned the NFL Most Valuable Player award that season. Kafka helped the team win Super Bowl LIV the following season.\nDespite being the backup quarterback in 2008 for Northwestern, Kafka finished second on the team in rushing yards with 321. Following C. J. Bach\u00e9r's graduation, Kafka became the starter for 2009. Against Syracuse, he set the school record for most consecutive pass completions with 16. In the same game, he became the first Big Ten Conference player to score a passing, receiving, and rushing touchdown since Zack Mills from Penn State in 2004. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. In the 2010 Outback Bowl against Auburn, Kafka set the all-time bowl record with 47 completions and 78 passing attempts. He set Northwestern and Outback Bowl records with 532 passing yards and an Outback Bowl record with five interceptions.Kafka spent two seasons as a member of the Eagles. In 2010, he was the third-string quarterback behind Michael Vick and Kevin Kolb but did not see playing time. He was mainly the third-string quarterback again in 2011 behind Vick and Vince Young, but saw some playing time in two games early in the season, both of which resulted in losses. He was expected to be the backup quarterback behind Vick in 2012 but a broken hand caused him to miss time in the preseason and was ultimately released in favor of rookie Nick Foles and veteran Trent Edwards. Kafka spent time on offseason rosters with the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars in 2013, on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squad in 2014, on the preseason roster with the Minnesota Vikings in 2015, and on the practice squad for the Tennessee Titans and Cincinnati Bengals in 2015.\nKafka became a graduate assistant with the Northwestern football team in 2016, and was hired by the Chiefs as an offensive quality control coach in 2017. He was promoted to quarterbacks coach in 2018, and helped the team win the Super Bowl during the 2019 season, his first as a player or coach. He was given an additional title of passing game coordinator in 2020. After the 2021 season, he joined the Giants as their offensive coordinator. He added the title of assistant head coach with the Giants in 2024."

The club is affiliated with Sk\u00e5nes Fotbollf\u00f6rbund (The Scanian Football Association), and plays its home games at Stadion. Formed on 24 February 1910, Malm\u00f6 FF is the most successful club in Sweden in terms of trophies won. The club have won the most league titles of any Swedish club with twenty-one, a joint record eighteen Swedish championship titles and a record fourteen national cup titles. The team competes in Allsvenskan as of the 2015 season; this is Malm\u00f6 FF's 15th consecutive season in the top flight, and their 80th overall. The main rivals of the club are Helsingborgs IF, IFK G\u00f6teborg and, historically, IFK Malm\u00f6.Since Malm\u00f6 FF's first competitive match, more than 450 players have made a league appearance for the club. Many of these players have spent only a short period of their career at Malm\u00f6 FF before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. Jari Litmanen transferred to the club after having a very successful career in various European clubs, Ajax being the most prominent. However Litmanen's two year Malm\u00f6 FF career was cut short by persistent injury problems. Igor Sypniewski who transferred to Malm\u00f6 before the club's 2004 title winning season only played eight matches and scored two goals before leaving the club due to personal problems, which led to the club releasing him due to breach of contract.As of 31 October 2015, a total of 240 players have played fewer than 25 competitive matches for the club. Of those players, 18 are still playing for the club and can add to their total. Three former players \u2013 Per-\u00c5ke \u00c5kesson, Jesper Bech and Ove Blomberg \u2013 each made 24 appearances during their spell at Malm\u00f6 FF.

His performance in the minor leagues made him one of the Braves' top pitching prospects. After the 2003 season, the Braves traded him to the Cardinals for outfielder J. D. Drew. \nWainwright made his MLB debut on September 11, 2005, and spent the rest of the season as a relief pitcher. The next year, he briefly assumed closer duties, saving the series-clinching games of the 2006 National League Championship Series and the 2006 World Series over the Detroit Tigers. In 2007, he returned to starting pitching, a role in which he has since remained. He missed the 2011 season due to Tommy John surgery, but emerged as an ace, leading the National League multiple times in wins, innings pitched, and games started. He also has multiple top-ten finishes in earned run average, strikeouts, walks plus hits per inning pitched, and complete games. In 2014, Wainwright became the first pitcher in Major League history to post nine of his first 18 starts with seven innings pitched and no runs allowed. In his career, Wainwright has won 200 games, received three All-Star selections and two Gold Glove Awards, and finished in the top three in the Cy Young Award balloting four times.\nWith 2,202 career strikeouts, Wainwright is second to Bob Gibson (3,117) in Cardinals franchise history. Wainwright and longtime teammate Yadier Molina are the most successful battery in Major League history, having both the most wins and starts together.\nOn September 18, 2023, he became the third Cardinals' pitcher to win 200 games, joining Bob Gibson (251), and Jesse Haines (210), and the 122nd in baseball history. With three strikeouts, he also became the 66th pitcher in baseball history with at least 2,200 strikeouts."
