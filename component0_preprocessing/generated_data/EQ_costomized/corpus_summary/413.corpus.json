He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers and the Vancouver Canucks. Luongo is a two-time NHL Second Team All-Star (2004 and 2007) and a winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals against average in the league (2011, with backup Cory Schneider). He was a finalist for several awards, including the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender (2004, 2007 and 2011), the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by his peers (2004 and 2007), and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (2007). Luongo is second all time in games played as an NHL goaltender (1,044) and fourth all time in wins (489). He employed the butterfly style of goaltending. Born in Montreal, Quebec, Luongo is of Italian and Irish ancestry. Prior to his NHL career, he played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Val-d'Or Foreurs and the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, winning back-to-back President's Cups and establishing the league's all-time play-off records in games played and wins. Following his second QMJHL season, Luongo was selected fourth overall by the Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. After splitting his professional rookie season between the Islanders and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters in 1999\u20132000, he was traded to the Panthers. In five seasons with Florida, Luongo established team records for most games played, wins and shutouts; despite several strong seasons, however, the Panthers remained a weak team and were unable to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs during Luongo's initial stint with the team. During the 2006 off-season, he was traded to the Canucks after failed contract negotiations with the Panthers. In his first season in Vancouver, Luongo won 47 games, and was runner-up in voting for both the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and Vezina Trophy (best goaltender).

Luongo served in that capacity for two seasons before resigning from the position in September 2010. In the subsequent 2010\u201311 season, he helped the Canucks to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals but lost to the Boston Bruins. During his eight-year tenure with Vancouver, Luongo became the team's all-time leader in wins and shutouts. He returned to the Panthers during the 2013\u201314 season, where he spent the remainder of his career, qualifying for the playoffs with the Panthers only once during that time. Internationally, Luongo has competed for Team Canada in numerous tournaments. As a junior, he won a silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships, while being named Best Goaltender in his second tournament appearance. Luongo won two gold medals at the 2003 and 2004 World Championships and a silver in the 2005 World Championships.

Due to a farm-machinery accident in his youth (April 17, 1888), Brown lost parts of two fingers on his right hand, and in the process gained a colorful nickname.

He played football as a linebacker for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) from 1965 to 1973. Through those nine seasons he was invited to eight Pro Bowls, named a first-team All-Pro six times, and was twice recognized by his peers as the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year. Renowned as a fierce tackler and for the relentless effort with which he played, Butkus is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most intimidating linebackers in pro football history. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Butkus played his entire football career in his home state, which began at Chicago Vocational High School. As a college football player at the University of Illinois, he was a linebacker and center for the Fighting Illini. A two-time consensus All-American, he led the Illini to a Rose Bowl victory in 1963 and was deemed the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference, and in 1964 he was named college football's Lineman of the Year by United Press International (UPI). He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Butkus was drafted by the Bears as the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL Draft. He soon established himself as a ball hawk with his penchant for forcing turnovers. In his NFL career, he intercepted 22 passes, recovered 27 fumbles (a record when he retired), and was responsible for causing many more fumbles with his jarring tackles. His tackling ability earned him both admiration and trepidation from opposing players. According to Hall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones, Butkus \"was a well-conditioned animal, and every time he hit you, he tried to put you in the cemetery, not the hospital.\" In 2009, the NFL Network named Butkus the most feared tackler of all time. Butkus is credited with having defined the middle linebacker position, and is still viewed as the \"gold standard by which other middle linebackers are measured.\" He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, and his No. 51 jersey is retired by the Bears. Following his playing career, Butkus began careers in acting, sports commentary, and celebrity endorsement. He is active in philanthropy through the Butkus Foundation, which manages various charitable causes."

He batted and threw left-handed, and he was nicknamed \"Sweet Music\" \u2013 a nickname he picked up after a Minnesota sports writer declared that when Viola pitched, there was \"Sweet Music\" in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The nickname was a play on the fact that his last name is also a name of a musical instrument, although pronounced differently. A fan began displaying a banner bearing the phrase in the outfield's upper deck whenever Viola pitched. Twins fans considered the banner to be a good luck charm.  The banner is now the property of the Minnesota Historical Society. It was again displayed when Viola was inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame. He was honored as a member of the Twins' \"All Dome\" team in 2009."

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Fernandez was proud of his roots and wore uniform number 50 in honor of Hawaii being the 50th state. The theme song to Hawaii Five-O was often played before his starts at Shea Stadium during his days with the Mets. Fernandez had an unorthodox pitching motion with a hesitation at the end, followed by a sudden slingshot sidearm delivery. This deceptive motion, coupled with an effective curveball and a rising fastball, made him a major strikeout threat throughout his career. Fernandez's strikeouts were often commemorated by Mets' fans in the upper deck putting up taped signs marked with the letter \"S\" for Sid.

His first professional team was the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, where he played from 1974 to 1976. He began his NFL career with the New York Giants and is best remembered for his role in the November 19, 1978, game where the Giants, ahead 17\u201312 with only seconds to play and their opponent out of time-outs, lost after his handoff (a play called by offensive coordinator Bob Gibson over Pisarcik's objections) to Larry Csonka was fumbled and returned for a touchdown by Herman Edwards of the Philadelphia Eagles. The play has since been referred to as \"The Fumble\" by Giants fans and \"The Miracle at the Meadowlands\" by Eagles fans, and it was instrumental in making the Quarterback kneel (also known as \"taking a knee\") a routine play for running down the clock at the end of a game. Pisarcik was traded to the Eagles in 1980 for a 6th round pick, primarily serving as the backup to QB Ron Jaworski. He stayed with the Eagles until retiring after the 1984 season.

He was selected with the second pick of the sixth round of the 1999 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He also played for the Detroit Lions in 2004. He was the leading receiver for the national champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team. Over the course of his career he was notable for fourth quarter performances in various bowl games and NFL playoff games.  As a professional athlete, he was known for his modesty. As an amateur athlete, he was known as one of the best high school athletes in the Chicago metropolitan area. In high school, he was an All-American in football and as a senior led his team to a 9\u20130 regular season before losing in the playoffs. In basketball, he was an All-State selection by numerous publications and led his team past Kevin Garnett's high school team to reach the finals of the state championship playoff tournament. Despite losing in the finals, he was the highest votegetter on the All-tournament team.  In track, he was a state long jump champion as a junior and runner-up as a senior when he also helped his school's 4 x 400 metres relay team finish third in the state. In 1995, he was widely regarded as the best high school athlete in the Chicago metropolitan area, winning athlete of the year awards from the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times and Illinois High School Association.  He is considered to be one of the greatest three-sport athletes in the history of Illinois. Streets led the Michigan Wolverines football team in receiving yards each season from 1996\u20131998.  He had two touchdown receptions in the 1998 Rose Bowl, which clinched a share of the national championship.  During his years as the primary receiver, there were quarterback controversies each year with battles among Brian Griese, Scott Dreisbach, Tom Brady and Drew Henson. As a senior, he was voted football team MVP and All-Big Ten Conference second-team wide receiver.  That season, he posted five 100-yard games and totaled over one thousand yards.  He played in the Senior Bowl and was selected for the Hula Bowl.  He was injured right before the 1999 draft causing him to slip from a projected second-round selection to a sixth-round choice.  As a sophomore, he played part of the season for the 1996\u201397 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team, which won the 1997 National Invitation Tournament, but has since vacated the championship due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. Streets had modest success as a professional in five seasons with the 49ers.  He began as a fourth wide receiver on a team with perennial Pro Bowl receivers Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens, but he eventually became a starter before moving on to play his final season with the Lions.  His career was highlighted by playoff performances in which he caught at least four receptions for at least 50 yards in all three playoff games.  He recorded two fourth quarter playoff touchdowns one of which was the game-winner in a 24-point comeback victory and the other of which was a game-tying touchdown in a losing effort."

Bell, who was born and raised in Bakersfield, California, played college football at the University of Arizona and was selected in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Steelers.  He was with the Steelers from 1976\u201380, earning Super Bowl rings in 1979 and 1980. He missed the 1977 season because of an injury. He is the Steelers' second-leading career punt returner, behind Rod Woodson. Bell spent his first three years as a reserve, rising to a starting role in 1980 due to injuries to both Lynn Swann and John Stallworth. His 25.8 yards-per-catch average led the AFC that year. He then held out of training camp the next year, hoping to get a salary increase based on his performance. He was instead waived, and was claimed by the Buccaneers, where he replaced Mike Shumann on the roster. He started 13 of 70 games he appeared in for the Bucs and had 95 catches for 1,470 yards and four TDs. During Bell's second season with the Steelers, his first wife, Kathy, appeared on Card Sharks and won several games for a total of $23,000 in prize money. He died in Tampa, Florida at age 52 after suffering from scleroderma and kidney disease. Scleroderma is a chronic disease that causes skin thickening and tightening and can cause damage to internal organs. He was survived by two children, Teleah Bell and Terran Bell (Kiana Bell)."

Before that, the  6'1\", 183\u00a0lbs. cornerback from the University of Missouri was an all-Big Eight defensive back in 1979 and '80. He played on three University of Missouri teams that appeared in bowl games, and was selected for Missouri's all-century team in 1990. Wright shares the Missouri record for the most pass interceptions in a game (three vs. San Diego State in 1979). Considered one of the best cover cornerbacks of his day, Wright played in ten NFL seasons, from 1981\u20131990, all for the 49ers including starting on four Super Bowl-winning teams. Wright made a key defensive play in the NFC Championship game on January 10, 1982 against the Dallas Cowboys. On the Cowboys' last possession in the final minute, after Dwight Clark had made The Catch, Wright made a touchdown-saving horse-collar tackle on Cowboy wide receiver Drew Pearson to preserve the 49er win and propel them into their first Super Bowl. A two-time Pro Bowler, Wright's peak performance year was during the 1983 season when he intercepted 7 passes for 164 yards and 2 touchdowns. He intercepted passes in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XIX. Wright missed a majority of the 1986 and 1987 seasons with a deep groin pull and chipped bone in the area, missing all but 4 games during the two-year stretch. But he returned as a starter in 1988 and was on the 49ers-back-to-back Super Bowl-winning teams. Wright is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.  He is currently an alumni coordinator for the 49ers."

As a 16-year-old rookie in 1943, he was the youngest player to appear in a National League game that season. McKee was one of many ballplayers who appeared in the Major Leagues only during World War II. He made his major league debut on August 18, 1943, in a home doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals at Shibe Park. The best game of his short career, however, came on October 3, 1943, the last day of the season, when he started the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field and pitched a complete game, winning 11\u20133. The losing pitcher was Cookie Cuccurullo, who was making his major league debut. Then, at 17, McKee became the youngest pitcher in the 20th century to throw a nine-inning complete-game victory on the final day of the regular season, a feat no one has accomplished since. McKee made his last pitching appearance for the Phillies on September 26, 1944. Overall, he posted a 1\u20130 record and a 5.87 earned run average in five games (one start), allowing 10 runs on 14 hits and six walks, while striking out one in 15 innings of work. He later switched to outfield and spent nine seasons in the minor Leagues spanning 1944\u201357, collecting a batting average of .287 and 115 home runs in 1,173 games. In 2014, McKee died in his hometown of Shelby, North Carolina, 15 days short before of his 88th birthday."

Once a popular figure with the U.S. public, he is now best known for being tried for the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. Simpson was initially acquitted of the murders in criminal court but was later found responsible for both deaths in a civil trial. Simpson attended the University of Southern California (USC), where he played football for the USC Trojans and won the Heisman Trophy in 1968. He played professionally as a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills from 1969 to 1977. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers from 1978 to 1979. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. He holds the record for the single-season yards-per-game average, which stands at 143.1. He was the only player to rush for over 2,000 yards in the 14-game regular season NFL format. Simpson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. After retiring from football, he began new careers in acting and football broadcasting. In 1994, Simpson was arrested and charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. He was acquitted by a jury after a lengthy and internationally publicized trial. The families of the victims subsequently filed a civil suit against him. A civil court awarded a $33.5 million judgment against him in 1997 for the victims' wrongful deaths. In 2000, Simpson moved to Miami, Florida to avoid paying on the liability judgment, which as of 2021 remained mostly unpaid. In 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with the felonies of armed robbery and kidnapping. In 2008, he was convicted and sentenced to 33 years' imprisonment, with a minimum of nine years without parole. He served his sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center near Lovelock, Nevada. Simpson was granted parole on July 20, 2017, which was the minimum sentence. He was eligible for release from prison on October 1, 2017, and was released on that date. On December 14, 2021, Simpson was granted early release from his parole by the Nevada Division of Parole and Probation."

Campbell attended Santa Teresa High School in San Jose, California. In 1980, during his senior year at the University of California, he set a then-NCAA record with 43 completed passes in 53 attempts in a losing effort against the Florida Gators. In four NFL seasons, Campbell played in just seven games with no starts. He was hampered by a weak throwing arm; offensive coordinator Bob Schnelker said Campbell didn't have the arm strength to play in the NFL. After he held out of minicamp, the Packers traded Campbell to the Los Angeles Raiders, where he never played a game. He has since become a newspaper columnist at Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers. As of the end of the 2020 season, Campbell is the last top-nine pick since the AFL-NFL merger to never start a regular season game. He is also the only quarterback selected in the top 30 from 1970 to 2019 to have never started a game.

His position is left-back. Pearce began his career as a trainee with Aston Villa on leaving school in 1991, turning professional in June 1993, but never made a first-team appearance and signed for local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in July 1995. He only made a handful of appearances at Molineux before his transfer to Notts County in July 1997. Pearce had far more chances at Notts County, who had just been relegated to Division Three. Manager Sam Allardyce gave Pearce a regular first-team place and his first season was a great success as he inspired County to Division Three title glory \u2013 in a historic season which saw County become the first English football team to win promotion before the end of March. In four seasons at Meadow Lane, Pearce played in some 140 first-team games and was Player of the Year in his final season at the club. He transferred to Peterborough United in June 2001, where due to injury and poor form he managed just 16 competitive first team games in three seasons. He joined Stafford Rangers, moving to Conference National side Northwich Victoria in September 2004. However, he was released by Northwich in December 2004 and rejoined Stafford Rangers. He moved to Redditch United in the 2005 close season, moving to local rivals Worcester City in January 2006. He was released by Worcester in March 2007 and joined A.F.C. Telford United. However, he was released by Telford at the end of the season. He moved from Halesowen Town to Bromsgrove Rovers in the 2008 close season and was appointed as Rovers' captain. However, in December 2008 he was linked with a move from Bromsgrove back to Halesowen Town. On 10 January 2009, he did indeed move back to The Yeltz. In late 2009 he joined Stratford Town on loan, remaining with the club until the end of the season. In February 2011 he joined Barwell as player-coach.

        "content": "Stephen James Murphy (born 11 December 1981) is a former professional ice hockey goaltender born in Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom. Murphy began playing ice hockey at the very young age of 5. He made his first professional appearances at the age of 16 with the Paisley Pirates, a team then icing in the BNL. Murphy made two appearances for the Pirates during the 1997/98 season before moving on to the Fife Flyers. Whilst in Fife, Murphy helped the Flyers win the Scottish Cup. He established himself as the Flyers' first choice goaltender despite his young age and in the 1998/99 season recorded a respectable GAA of 3.61 and a save percentage of .918. In 1999, at the age of 17, Murphy became the goaltender for the Great Britain National Team and played on five occasions for them in the World Junior Championships, proving himself to be a reliable last line of defence.  This solidified his position as the Flyers' first choice goaltender and he continued to play for them during the 1999/00 season, featuring in the BNL as well as the B&H Cup and the Christmas Cup.  Once again the Flyers made the post-season, with Murphy playing every game in the playoffs. In 2000, Murphy moved to the United States to sign for the Omaha Lancers, of the USHL. He failed to make an appearance and moved mid-season to the Cleveland Barons. Again Murphy failed to make a start but learned considerably from his time in the USA. He finished the 2000/01 season back in Scotland, once again playing for the Flyers. In the summer of 2001, Murphy played again for the Team GB junior squad but also featured for the senior team where he recorded an excellent 1.97 goals against average and a .917 save percentage. Murphy remained in Scotland for the 2001/02 term, although he signed for the Dundee Stars and played alongside British hockey great Tony Hand for the first time at club level. Murphy played 43 games for the Stars in the regular season and made 10 post season appearances, again proving his worth despite his young age. He again appeared for Team GB in 2002, in the World Cup.  Murphy remained in his hometown of Dundee for the 2002/03 season, whilst the British ice hockey organisation was undergoing considerable restructuring. Here he played with Hand for a second spell. A move followed for the 2003/04 term, this time to the Bracknell Bees, a team now playing in the transitional BNL following the collapse of the ISL. Murphy played just 8 regular season games for the Bees due to a shoulder injury which kept him off the ice for the remainder of the season. He moved into European hockey for the 2004/05 season. He found regular games with Swedish Division 1 team Br\u00e4cke IK.  Murphy proved to be an excellent signing for Br\u00e4cke and became known for his speed and agility.  After 3 months, Murphy was poached by the higher level Allsvenskan team IF Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven to play out the remainder of the season for them.  Murphy adapted to the change in standard well, and completed the season as a Bj\u00f6rkl\u00f6ven player.  They failed to make the post-season however and so Murphy returned to Scotland to play in three post-season games for the Stars. The following season, after again playing for Team GB, Murphy returned to the Allsvenskan to ice for IFK Arboga IK. Arboga struggled in the league but managed to retain their Allsvenskan place through playing in the end of season relegation playoffs.  Arboga struggled financially however, prompting Murphy to return to the United Kingdom and play for the Edinburgh Capitals in the recently established EIHL, now the top level of ice hockey in the UK following the lengthy restructuring process. Murphy played every regular season game for the Capitals, and won the EIHL 'Best British Goaltender' award for his play. Despite this, the Capitals failed to make the EIHL post-season as they struggled for regular goalscorers. Murphy returned to Scandinavia and Norway to ice for Stjernen Hockey, a team playing in the GET-ligaen, the top club league in Norway.  In 36 regular season games, Murphy recorded a 3.18 GAA and a .901 PCT. In the summer of 2008, Murphy was persuaded to once again play alongside Tony Hand, with Hand now acting as player/coach of the EIHL Manchester Phoenix. Murphy had proved an excellent signing for the Phoenix and has once again established himself as the organisation's first choice goaltender.  A solid season followed for Murphy, who helped the Phoenix to both the Knockout and Challenge Cup finals and once again was awarded Best British Goaltender.  Despite the on-ice success, the Phoenix withdrew from the EIHL at the end of the season in favour of playing in the EPL, going on to sign Steve Fone as first choice goaltender. Murphy chose to remain in the EIHL however, and move on to the Belfast Giants. After over a decade in Belfast, in March 2021 Murphy was signed by fellow EIHL side Manchester Storm as one of their back-up netminders for the 2021 Elite Series. Murphy announced his retirement from the sport in July 2021."

He was a pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators and Detroit Tigers over all or parts of seven seasons spanning 1942\u201351. Listed at  tall and , he batted and threw right-handed. In 109 MLB games (27 as a starting pitcher) and  innings pitched, Calvert allowed 345 hits and 158 bases on balls. He struck out 102, threw five complete games and earned five saves. Born in Montreal, Quebec, Calvert broke into professional baseball in 1938. He spent most of the year playing in the Quebec Provincial League, at the time a minor league unaffiliated with MLB. He then played in three games for the Montreal Royals, and showed enough promise that the New York Giants gave him a tryout, but they passed on signing him as they felt he needed more experience.  After spending 1939 out of organized baseball, Calvert was signed by the Cleveland Indians organization to a contract in 1940, and was invited to spring training. He then spent the season with the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois\u2013Indiana\u2013Iowa League and the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League, playing in 21 total games for the two teams. He spent 1941 with Cedar Rapids, and finished the year with six wins, three losses, and a 2.39 earned run average (ERA) in 11 games. He signed with the Cleveland organization and in 1942 he won 17 of 24 decisions with a 2.22 ERA with Wilkes-Barre. That led to his call up to the Indians' roster when he made his MLB debut with two scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox on September 24 in his only major league appearance of the season. Calvert spent three full seasons\u20141944, 1949, and 1950\u2014in the big leagues. His most notable campaign, 1949 with the Senators, saw him lead the American League in games lost (17) and in pitchers' fielding percentage (1.000 in 55 chances). His minor league career essentially ended after the 1952 season, although he got into three games in 1955 with the Class C Modesto Reds."

He also amassed a total of 35 caps for the Northern Ireland national football team. Following his playing career, he went into management, taking charge of various clubs in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jackson began his professional football career playing for Glentoran. He became a regular in the Glentoran side by the age of 21, and won league-winners' medals in 1967 and 1968 before signing for Everton in February 1968. In just over two seasons with the Toffees, Jackson picked up yet another league-winners' medal in 1970. His performances as understudy to the likes of Alan Ball and Howard Kendall attracted the attention of other clubs and, after just 32 league appearances for Everton, Jackson was signed by Nottingham Forest in October 1970. Forest were struggling for survival in the First Division, but Jackson still only managed to make 81 appearances, albeit scoring six goals. The arrival of Brian Clough and the emergence of Martin O'Neill saw Jackson's opportunities become even fewer and further between, and he was granted a free transfer in the summer of 1975. He was then signed by Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty with the intention of Jackson captaining the club's reserve team and instilling a level of professionalism in the club, which had just been promoted back into the First Division. However, Jackson made such a good impression that he was rewarded with 17 league starts that season, helping the team to an impressive third-place finish. Nevertheless, he spent the 1976\u201377 season back in his intended reserve team role before retiring back to Ireland to become the player-manager at Waterford United. There, he led the club to two consecutive FAI Cup finals, winning the competition in 1980. Despite the FAI Cup win, one trophy in four years was not enough for the Waterford United board, and Jackson was sacked in 1982. It was a whole year before he got another management job, returning to Northern Ireland as manager of Crusaders in July 1983. The team won the Gold Cup in 1985, beating Linfield 2\u20131 in the final, but Jackson left the club in October of the following season, before returning to his first club, Glentoran, three months later. In  years at Glentoran, Jackson led the team to 16 major trophies, including the Double in 1988, but the team's form began to dip after their title win in 1992, and Jackson was sacked in July 1993. He then spent a further year in charge of Ballymena United."

        "content": "Alessandro Orlando (born 1 June 1970) is an Italian former professional footballer who played a defender. A quick, talented, energetic, and dynamic offensive left-back, with a powerful shot and good technique, he excelled at providing long passes and crosses to forwards and at making attacking runs down the flank. Despite his offensive and creative prowess, he was inconsistent at times, however, and was less effective defensively, as he often struggled in one on one situations with forwards. A predominantly left-footed player, he was also an accurate free-kick taker. Although he was often a reserve player at Milan and Juventus, Orlando is one of the six players to win the Serie A title in two successive years with different clubs, winning the 1993\u201394 Serie A title with Milan, and the 1994\u201395 Serie A title with Juventus; the other five are Giovanni Ferrari, Riccardo Toros, Eraldo Mancin, Roberto Baggio, and Andrea Pirlo."

After attending St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago, Illinois, he played college football for Northwestern, where he received second-team All-Big Ten Conference honors as a senior. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft, and spent six seasons in the NFL as a journeyman quarterback. Kafka became the quarterbacks coach for the Chiefs in 2018, and Patrick Mahomes, the starting quarterback for the Chiefs, earned the NFL Most Valuable Player award that season. Kafka helped the team win Super Bowl LIV the following season. Despite being the backup quarterback in 2008 for Northwestern, Kafka finished second on the team in rushing\u00a0yards with 321. Following C. J. Bach\u00e9r's graduation, Kafka became the starter for 2009. Against Syracuse, he set the school record for most consecutive pass completions with 16. In the same game, he became the first Big Ten Conference player to score a passing, receiving, and rushing touchdown since Zack Mills from Penn State in 2004. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. In the 2010 Outback Bowl against Auburn, Kafka set the all-time bowl record with 47 completions and 78 passing attempts. He set Northwestern and Outback Bowl records with 532 passing yards and an Outback Bowl record with five interceptions. Kafka spent two seasons as a member of the Eagles. In 2010, he was the third-string quarterback behind Michael Vick and Kevin Kolb but did not see playing time. He was mainly the third-string quarterback again in 2011 behind Vick and Vince Young, but saw some playing time in two games early in the season, both of which resulted in losses. He was expected to be the backup quarterback behind Vick in 2012 but a broken hand caused him to miss time in the preseason and was ultimately released in favor of rookie Nick Foles and veteran Trent Edwards. Kafka spent time on offseason rosters with the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars in 2013, on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squad in 2014, on the preseason roster with the Minnesota Vikings in 2015, and on the practice squad for the Tennessee Titans and Cincinnati Bengals in 2015. Kafka became a graduate assistant with the Northwestern football team in 2016, and was hired by the Chiefs as an offensive quality control coach in 2017. He was promoted to quarterbacks coach in 2018, and helped the team win the Super Bowl during the 2019 season, his first as a player or coach. He was given an additional title of passing game coordinator in 2020. After the 2021 season, he joined the Giants as their offensive coordinator."
