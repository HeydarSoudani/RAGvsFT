It generally aired on the first Saturday of each month at 7:30PM, each show running 45 minutes. 133 shows were produced. The show was hosted by German actor and comedian Ilja Richter. Its lesser known predecessor on ZDF, 4-3-2-1 Hot & Sweet was aired between 1966 and 1970, presenters included Ilja Richter and Suzanne Doucet. Disco generally served a younger pop-oriented audience compared to ZDF's own Hitparade show, and until 1972, its main competitor was Beat-Club (originally patterned after the pure live-act show Ready Steady Go! in the UK, from the late-1960s turning more and more into psychedelic music videos made especially for the invited acts), followed by Musikladen, both on ARD.\nStarting in 1984, reruns Disco were shown regularly on ZDF Musikkanal and, after the 1989 closedown of the latter, on 3sat, lasting for a full 25 years. The ZDF Theaterkanal (which is now zdf.kultur) aired repeats of the entire series between 2004 and 2012. In 2007, ZDF Dokukanal began to air reruns, starting with episodes from 1975. Multiple repeats of the series have also been shown on hit24.\nThe show focused on chart hits current at the time of airing, giving about equal airtime to international pop music and German Schlager. Despite its name, it did not particularly focus on disco music although it featured many disco hits as long as they were chart relevant. (The name of the show was devised before disco as a musical style existed)."

Formed in 1988 in Tumwater and Olympia, Washington, the band currently consists of Justin Trosper (vocals, guitar), Jared Warren (bass guitar), Sara Lund (drums), and Scott Seckington (guitar). \nOriginally founded by Trosper, bassist Vern Rumsey and drummer Brandt Sandeno under the name \"Giant Henry,\" Sandeno was replaced in 1992 by Lund who performed on their debut album in 1993. Largely based in Olympia throughout the 1990s, the trio consisting of Lund, Trosper, and Rumsey recorded seven albums, plus numerous singles, and toured relentlessly until the band's dissolution in 2002. \nOften classified as noise rock in addition to post-hardcore, Unwound played a sharply dissonant and angular style that made use of unusual guitar tones, and garnered attention locally for their relentless touring schedules, favour towards \"all ages\" venues and their strong DIY ethics. Unwound was largely associated with the independent record label Kill Rock Stars throughout the 1990s, with the band's debut album, Fake Train (1993), being the first non-spoken word release from the label. Unwound's wider stature grew with the release of the band's fifth and sixth studio albums Repetition (1996) and Challenge for a Civilized Society (1998), which saw the band experiment with their sound beyond noise rock. Unwound's self-produced seventh album, Leaves Turn Inside You (2001), was the band's only double album, and saw the band stylistically shift into post-rock and avant-garde territory; it was critically acclaimed and later appeared on several best-of album lists of the 2000s.Following a disastrous U.S. tour in support of Leaves Turn Inside You, Unwound announced their disbandment in 2002, citing the bandmembers' geographical differences and Vern Rumsey's worsening alcoholism, caused by the stress of touring. Plans for a reunion were repeatedly brought up and shot down throughout the 2010s due to Rumsey's continuous health struggles, and ultimately never occurred before his death in August 2020. In July 2022, Trosper and Lund reformed Unwound for a 2023 tour in Rumsey's memory, with Jared Warren filing in on bass and Scott Seckington on guitar.Well regarded during their initial existence, Unwound has frequently been seen as one of the most influential bands of the 1990s and has garnered a dedicated cult following since their 2002 disbandment. In 2013, The A.V. Club called Unwound \"the best band of the 90s\". Unwound spawned numerous side projects in the wake of their disbandment."

Despite being touted as the 2009 blockbuster of the year and featuring many established actors and actresses like Zoe Tay, Li Nanxing and Fann Wong (often referred to in the press as a \"Two Queen and One King\" billing), the show's reception was lukewarm. Many viewers faulted the serial for improbable casting; Lin Meijiao was cast as Tay's mother, despite being only five years older than Tay in real life. Furthermore, the two had acted as sisters before in My Mighty-in-Laws. \nThe series also came under harsh criticism for being overly melodramatic and for a lack of originality in certain parts of the scripting. However, the performances of newcomers such as Jerry Yeo, who played an antagonist for the first time, were widely praised. In 2022, the series was released on the streaming service Netflix."

        "content": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a 1991 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, who co-wrote the script with William Wisher. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and Edward Furlong, it is the sequel to The Terminator (1984) and is the second installment in the Terminator franchise. In the film, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator\u2014a highly advanced killing machine\u2014back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor, when he is a child. The resistance sends back a less advanced, reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity.\nThe Terminator was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's careers, but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation, which partially owned the film's rights. In 1990, Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from The Terminator producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. Principal photography began from October 1990 to March 1991, taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94\u2013102 million budget, making it the most expensive film made at the time. The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun. Theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before the picture's release on July 3, 1991.\nTerminator 2 was a critical and commercial success, grossing $519\u2013520.9 million at the box office to become the highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide and the third-highest-grossing film of its time. The film won several accolades, including Saturn, BAFTA, and Academy awards. Terminator 2 merchandise includes video games, comic books, novels, and T2-3D: Battle Across Time, a live-action attraction.\nTerminator 2 is considered one of the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made. It is also seen as a major influence on visual effects in films, helping usher in the transition from practical effects to reliance on computer-generated imagery. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2023. Although Cameron intended for Terminator 2 to be the end of the franchise, it was followed by a series of sequels, including Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), as well as a 2008 television series."

The song was produced by The Messengers and was written by Brown. The song is about yearning to rebuild a failed relationship and was interpreted by critics as being about Brown's former relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna. However, Brown has stated the song is not about any of his previous relationships.\nThe song received positive to mixed reviews. It charted in the top twenty in Japan and New Zealand, and the top forty in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It peaked in the United States at number fifty-three. The accompanying music video features Brown and American R&B singer Cassie as his love interest. In the video, he yearns for their relationship on a winter night in a city and in a desert scene. Brown performed the song on his 2009 Fan Appreciation Tour, and on BET's SOS: Help for Haiti Telethon, which benefited victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake."

It is regarded as an important early work of American feminist literature for its illustration of the attitudes towards mental and physical health of women in the 19th century.  It is also lauded as an excellent work of horror fiction.\nThe story is written as a collection of journal entries narrated in the first person.  The journal was written by a woman whose physician husband has rented an old mansion for the summer. Forgoing other rooms in the house, the husband confines the woman to an upstairs nursery. As a form of treatment, the husband forbids the journal writer from working or writing, and encourages her to eat well and get plenty of air so that she can recuperate from what he calls a \"temporary nervous depression \u2013 a slight hysterical tendency\", a common diagnosis in women at the time.  As the reader continues through the journal entries, they experience the writer's gradual descent into madness with nothing better to do than observe the peeling yellow wallpaper in her room."

The show piloted on NBC in 1965 and the regular series debuted in 1966 on the same network. The board for the game is a 3 \u00d7 3 vertical stack of open-faced cubes, each occupied by a celebrity seated at a desk and facing the contestants. The stars are asked questions by the host and the contestants judge the truth of their answers to gain squares in the right pattern to win the game.\nThough Hollywood Squares was a legitimate game show, the game largely acted as the background for the show's comedy in the form of joke answers (commonly called \"zingers\" by the production staff), often given by the stars prior to their real answer. The show's writers usually supplied the jokes. In addition, the stars were given the questions' subjects and bluff (plausible, but incorrect) answers prior to the show. The show was scripted in this sense, but the gameplay was not. In any case, as original host Peter Marshall explained at the beginning of the Secret Square game, the celebrities were briefed prior to the show to help them with bluff answers, but they heard the actual questions for the first time as they were asked on air.\nMarshall hosted the original version of Hollywood Squares that aired on NBC from 1966 to 1980, as well as a nighttime syndicated version that ran from 1971 to 1981. It then returned to NBC in 1983 as part of a 60-minute hybrid series with Match Game, featuring Jon Bauman hosting the Hollywood Squares portion of that show. Following Marshall's retirement, the show has since been revived twice in syndication: a version hosted by John Davidson from 1986 to 1989, and another hosted by Tom Bergeron from 1998 to 2004.\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked it at No. 7 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever.

M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's most recent studio album, Saints of Los Angeles, was released on June 24, 2008. What was planned to be the band's final show took place on New Year's Eve, December 31, 2015. The concert was filmed for a theatrical and Blu-ray release in 2016.After two-and-a-half years of inactivity, Neil announced in September 2018 that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce had reunited and was working on new material. On March 22, 2019, the band released four new songs on the soundtrack for its Netflix biopic The Dirt, based on the band's New York Times best-selling autobiography of the same name. The soundtrack went to number one on the iTunes All Genres Album Chart, number 3 on the Billboard Top Album and Digital Album sales charts, number 10 on the Billboard 200, and Top 10 worldwide. The autobiography returned to the New York Times Best Seller list at number 6 on Nonfiction Print and number 8 on Nonfiction Combined Print & E-Book. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce embarked on its first major tour in seven years in the summer and fall of 2022, co-headlining a North American tour with Def Leppard.The band has experienced several lineup changes over the years, leaving Sixx as the only constant member; these included the introduction of lead vocalist John Corabi (who was Neil's replacement from 1992 to 1996) and drummers Randy Castillo and Samantha Maloney, both of whom filled in for Lee following his departure from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce in 1999; he returned to the band in 2004. In October 2022, after 41 years of service, Mars announced his retirement from touring with the band, with former Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie guitarist John 5 replacing him."

They have experienced lineup changes over the years, all with founding member Jason Navarro as lead singer and front man. The contemporary lineup includes Ryan Vandeberghe on drums, Rich Tschirhart on bass and Justin Malek on guitar.\nThe band's musical style initially blended elements of punk rock, ska, and hardcore into genres popularly known as ska punk and ska-core, which characterized their first two albums. After a brief foray in a more radio friendly direction, they shifted back towards their mid-1990s style, bringing back ska punk, as well as a heavier ferocity with strong political overtones that draws from early hardcore punk. \nThe Suicide Machines have achieved a high level of underground recognition through relentless touring, including multiple performances on the Warped Tour, Riot Fest and for many years their annual hometown Black Christmas festivals. \nIn 2019, the band entered Marc Jacob Hudson's Rancho Recordo, with producer Roger Lima of Less Than Jake to record a new full-length album, Revolution Spring. The album was released March 27, 2020, via Fat Wreck Chords. A music video, \"To Play Caesar (Is To Be Stabbed To Death)\" from the Revolution Spring album was released in 2020 as well. \nIn 2022, the band released a split 12\" with Japanese band Coquettish, entitled \"Gebo Gomi\" on Bad Time Records."

C. Potter and produced by Martin Rackin and Milton Sperling from a screenplay by Roland Kibbee and Allan Scott. (Carrollton Inc. was Hayward's own production company, named for her adopted hometown in Georgia.)\nThe story is very loosely adapted from the 1951 novel Melville Goodwin, U.S.A. by John P. Marquand, which had previously been adapted in 1952 for television's \"Pulitzer Prize Playhouse.\" Hollywood avoided filming the novel for years because of its touchy subject matter: a married general's affair with a wealthy journalist. The screenwriters finally wound up rewriting the plot. The names of the two characters\u2014Melville Goodwin and Dottie Peale\u2014were retained, but both were made single. The film's credits state that it is \"based on characters\" in Marquand's book, rather than on the book itself.\nThe music score was by Roy Webb, the cinematography by Stanley Cortez and costume design by Charles LeMaire.\nThe film co-stars Paul Stewart and Jim Backus. The original leads were to be Humphrey Bogart and wife Lauren Bacall, and they were filmed doing a wardrobe test in 1956. But Bogart's illness forced his withdrawal from the project, and Bacall opted to remain at home to care for him until his death in 1957."

The trio grew to a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, recorded their debut album and, with their new label, began seeing more success, winning a Grammy Award in 1975 for Best Country Vocal Performance for \"Fairytale\" (1974).

In the film, Rhys Meyers' character, a former professional tennis player, marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Scarlett Johansson. The film deals with themes of morality and greed, and explores the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for an English setting.\nCritics in the United States praised the film and its English setting, and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen. In contrast, reviewers from the United Kingdom treated Match Point less favorably, finding fault with the locations and especially the British idiom in the dialogues. Allen was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay."

She re-wrote a demo of the song to the current version, which was then produced by Madonna and Hooper. A mid-tempo electronic and house song with acid, ambient and techno influences, \"Bedtime Story\" has an underlying skeletal synth melody influenced by minimal trance music. The track's unconventional, electronic sound was a departure from the pop-R&B-based tracks throughout the rest of the album. Lyrically, the song talks about the joys of the unconscious world.\n\"Bedtime Story\" received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's hypnotic and electronic style, and deemed it an underrated song which could have had great potential. Commercially, the single reached the top-ten in the record charts of the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia, but missed the top 40 in the United States, while peaking at number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. The accompanying music video for \"Bedtime Story\" was directed by Mark Romanek and is listed as one of the most expensive music videos of all time with a cost of $5 million ($10 million in 2023 dollars). It features surrealistic and new age imagery, with influences from artists such as Remedios Varo, Frida Kahlo and Leonora Carrington. The video received acclaim from critics and is permanently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\"Bedtime Story\" was performed at the 1995 Brit Awards in London with Madonna wearing a silver Versace dress and long blonde extensions, becoming one of the 30 best moments of the awards show history according to Marie Claire. A remixed version of the song was also used as a video interlude on her Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, and was later performed by Madonna on her 2023\u201324 Celebration Tour. Critics and scholars noted that the song foreshadowed Madonna's move towards electronic music in her future work."

        "content": "Davey and Goliath is a Christian clay-animated children's television series, whose central characters were created by Art Clokey, Ruth Clokey, and Dick Sutcliffe, and which was produced first by the United Lutheran Church in America and later by the Lutheran Church in America. The show was aimed at a youth audience, and generally dealt with issues such as respect for authority, sharing, and prejudice. Eventually, these themes included serious issues such as racism, death, religious intolerance and vandalism. Each 15-minute episode features the adventures of a boy named Davey Hansen and his \"talking\" dog Goliath (although only Davey and the viewer can hear him speak) as they learn the love of God through everyday occurrences. Many of the episodes also feature Davey's parents John and Elaine, his sister Sally, as well as Davey's friends: Jimmy, Teddy, and Nathaniel in earlier episodes, and Jonathan, Nicky, and Francisco in later ones.\nIn general, the characters find themselves in situations that have to be overcome by placing their faith in God. While the show is explicitly faith-based, there is no content specifically about the Lutheran Church, which made broadcasters more comfortable with the idea of an overtly religious mainstream children's show. The only reference to Lutherans in the show was the theme song, an instrumental version of \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\", and the Luther rose displayed in the opening theme and end credits.Following Clokey's success with the Gumby series, Davey and Goliath premiered in syndication on February 25, 1961 as a Saturday feature, and lasted until 1965. By May 1961, it was reported that \"Millions of children in cities and towns across the United States and Canada are talking about two new television stars, 'Davey and Goliath'.\"Davey's friends Nathaniel (in the 1960s episodes) and Jonathan (in the 1970s episodes) were some of the first black characters to appear as friends of a television show's white lead character.After its initial run, several 30-minute holiday-themed episodes were created in the late 1960s. The series then resumed with some new characters in 1971 and continued until 1973. In 1975, a final 30-minute summer episode was created. In 2004, Joe Clokey and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the successor body to the LCA, produced a new special, Davey and Goliath's Snowboard Christmas."

The four members of the Blossoms \u2014 Gloria Jones, Nanette Williams, Fanita James, and Darlene Wright \u2014 first sang together in 1957. In 1962, Phil Spector created the group Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans with James and Wright; Jones and Williams then formed their own group, The Girlfriends, with Carolyn Willis (formerly of The Ikettes). They released one single, \"My One and Only Jimmy Boy\", on Colpix Records in 1963, written and produced by David Gates. \"My One and Only Jimmy Boy\" used production techniques similar to Phil Spector's. The session for \"My One and Only Jimmy Boy\" was arranged and paid for by Jan & Dean member Jan Berry. The record peaked at #49 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1964 and #77 on the Cashbox charts. The Girlfriends never released another record; however, they recorded two more songs for a second single, \"Baby Don't Cry\" and \"I Don't Believe in You\", which were never released. Colpix had slated them for issue in early 1964, but according to the group members, the assassination of John F. Kennedy put a damper on record sales and releases, and their second single was shelved in the event's wake. Following the Girlfriends, Willis worked as a session singer for musicians such as Lou Rawls and O.C. Smith, and later joined Honey Cone; both she and Jones sang in one of the nostalgia-circuit groups performing as The Shirelles in the 1990s.\n\n\n== References =="

The film's plot follows two American backpackers, David and Jack, who are attacked by a werewolf while travelling in England, causing David to become a werewolf under the next full moon.Landis wrote the first draft of the screenplay for the film in 1969 and shelved it for over a decade. Prospective financiers believed that Landis' script was too frightening to be a comedy film and too humorous to be a horror film. After achieving success in Hollywood with the comedies The Kentucky Fried Movie, National Lampoon's Animal House and The Blues Brothers, Landis was able to secure financing from PolyGram Pictures to produce An American Werewolf in London.\nAn American Werewolf in London was released in the US by Universal Pictures on August 21, 1981. It was a critical and commercial success, winning the 1981 Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and the inaugural Academy Award for Best Makeup. Since its release, it has become a cult classic. A sequel, An American Werewolf in Paris, was released by Hollywood Pictures in 1997 and received mostly negative reviews upon its release."

On returning to New York City, she co-wrote the script and played a fictionalized version of herself. The plot involves her recounting the story of the disaster to her fictional parents and fianc\u00e9, with the footage interspersed with stock footage of icebergs, Titanic's sister ship Olympic and the ship's captain, Edward Smith. To add to the film's authenticity, Gibson wore the same clothes as on the night of the disaster. The filming took place in a Fort Lee, New Jersey studio and aboard a derelict ship in New York Harbor.\nThe film was released internationally and attracted large audiences and positive reviews, though some criticized it for commercializing the tragedy so soon after the event. It is now regarded as a lost film, as the last known prints were destroyed in the \u00c9clair studio fire in March 1914. Only a few printed stills and promotional photos are known to survive.

Produced by Reggie Lucas, it was written by Madonna with the intention that her friend Mark Kamins would play it in his sets at Danceteria, where he was the resident DJ. In 1982, Madonna was signed on by Sire Records for the release of two 12\" singles; after the success of first single \"Everybody\", the label approved the recording of an album, and the singer decided to work with Lucas. However, problems between Madonna and the producer arose and he ended up leaving the project; she then called John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, her boyfriend at the time, to work on the remaining songs. \nA dance song with disco influences, the lyrics to \"Lucky Star\" are a double-entendre that compare a lover's body with the stars in the sky. It was first released as a double-sided single with \"Holiday\" on August 1983. One month later, it was published as a stand-alone single in Europe and the United Kingdom; in the United States, a release was issued on August 8, 1984. Critics reacted positively towards \"Lucky Star\", highlighting its optimistic sound; in retrospective reviews, it is now considered one of Madonna's best singles. It reached the fourth spot of the US Billboard Hot 100, giving Madonna her first top-five hit. It also peaked within the top-ten in Canada, and the top 20 in Ireland and the United Kingdom. \nThe song's music video shows the singer dancing against a white backdrop with her brother Christopher and her friend Erika Belle. Some authors noted that in the video Madonna portrayed herself in a narcissistic way, that she was referring to herself as the titular lucky star. Additionally, after the visual's release, the singer's fashion became a trend among the younger generation. Madonna has performed \"Lucky Star\" in four of her concert tours, the last being 2015\u20132016's Rebel Heart Tour. The single has been referenced in movies like Pulp Fiction (1994), and covered and sampled by artists such as Chris Colfer and Carly Rae Jepsen."

This is not to be confused with the quarterly magazine with the same name Dialog; which focuses on Polish-German relations.For years, it has been the most important source of the modern repertoire from all over the world for Polish theatres, and besides the plays themselves, it has also been providing information concerning the most important foreign premieres. It has been publishing articles dedicated to the theatre and the play writing and it has been working in the field of anthropology of theatre.\nThe magazine was founded in 1956 by Adam Tarn, a translator, playwright and journalist. The following editors of the magazine were, among others, Konstanty Puzyna and Jerzy Koenig. For over ten years, the magazine has been headed by Jacek Sieradzki. Dialog's task is to publish the newest Polish plays. \nEach issue of the magazine contains one or two domestic contemporary plays, which were previously neither published nor staged. From here they reach the stages of Polish theatres. The magazine is therefore an important forum for playwright debuts; several generations of Polish playwrights begun their careers from a publication in Dialog. At the same time, the most important mission of the magazine is to provide quick and competent information to the Polish reader, concerning the current theatrical life outside Poland, and for many years Dialog was the only opening to the Western world for Polish directors, translators, literary directors, the community interested in theatre and theatrical literature. Other than Polish plays, each issue contained translations of the most important international plays and theoretical texts dedicated to the creation of the most outstanding western authors. \nDialog has published almost all of the most outstanding Polish playwrights, among others: S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek, Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz, Janusz G\u0142owacki, as well as accomplished foreign authors, including Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Heiner M\u00fcller, and from the younger generation Mark Ravenhill, Jon Fosse, Marius von Mayenburg, Sergi Belbel, and David Robson.\nSince 2010, the publisher of Dialog is the Polish Book Institute."

The first issue was published in Fall 1993. As of 2002, its editorial collective consisted of Jason McQuinn (Anarchy), Chuck Munson (Infoshop.org) and Thomas Wheeler (Out of Bounds). Munson was co-editor and reviewer from 1997 to 2003, when he was replaced by Allan Antliff. The magazine was first published by C.A.L. Press and then by AAL Press.According to its self-description, \"The Alternative Press Review is your window on the world of independent media. APR publishes a wide variety of the best essays from radical zines, books, magazines, blogs and web sites. Plus, APR publishes a selection of short and lively article excerpts, along with reviews, commentary and columns on the alternative press scene and other alternative media.\"  In practice the magazine has featured media criticism (e.g. \"The Decline of American Journalism\" by Daniel Brandt), coverage of resistance movements (e.g. \"An Interview with Zapatista Women\" by Guio Rovera Sancho), and cultural criticism (e.g. \"Immediatism vs. Capitalism\" by Hakim Bey, \"Flyposter Frenzy\" by Matthew Fuller, and \"Dark Age: Why Johnny can't Dissent\" by Tom Frank). The magazine's chief concerns, according to New Statesman are \"sex, other media and the CIA\". Contributors to the review have included McQuinn, Noam Chomsky, David Barsamian,Richard Heinberg  and Harold Pinter.\nAlternative Press Review was criticized by Kirsten Anderberg in a 2005 issue for the fact that its contributors were overwhelmingly male, a phenomenon that according by Wheeler is a result of low numbers of submissions from female writers. McQuinn responded to Anderberg by stating that the gender of writers and publishers within socially conscious alternative and radical media was \"simply irrelevant\".The review was described in 1994 by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as \"[c]loser to the edge of the magazine world, and not quite as articulate as the Utne Reader\" \u2013 the magazine's main rival and market leader. Ian Hargreaves, writing in the New Statesman in 1998, called the magazine \"the real rivet-spitter on the block\" of alternative media, while a 1999 OC Weekly feature hailed it as \"the essential nutrient missing from one\u2019s daily McMedia diet of misinformation and disinformation.\"Web-site is defunct since at least 2005."

Following the end of their initial contract with RCA, they released the Future Present Past EP (2016) through Casablancas' label Cult.

        "content": "Changeling is a 2008 American mystery crime drama film directed, produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood and written by J. Michael Straczynski. The story was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop murders in Mira Loma, California. It stars Angelina Jolie as a woman united with a boy who she realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate that to the police and city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother and confined to a psychiatric ward. The film explores themes of child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, and mistreatment of mental health patients.\nWorking in 1983 as a special correspondent for the now defunct TV-Cable Week magazine, Straczynski first learned the story of Christine Collins and her son from a Los Angeles City Hall contact. Over the ensuing years he kept researching the story but never felt he was ready to tackle it. Out of television writing for several years and known to be difficult to work with, he returned to researching and then finally writing the story in 2006.  Almost all of the film's script was drawn from thousands of pages of documentation. His first draft became the shooting script; it was his first film screenplay to be produced. Ron Howard had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his Imagine Entertainment partner Brian Grazer produced Changeling alongside Malpaso Productions' Robert Lorenz and Eastwood. Universal Pictures financed and distributed the film.\nSeveral actors campaigned for the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, John Malkovich, Michael Kelly and Amy Ryan. While some characters are composites, most are based on actual people. Principal photography, which began on October 15, 2007 and concluded a few weeks later in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in southern California. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted in a calm set and short working days.

The singer, who had been a notorious drinker, was sober by this time thanks to his wife Nancy, who had gotten his career back on track after years of mismanagement and missed concert dates."

It features comprehensive session highlights and outtakes, with the first 19 tracks comprising a hypothetical version of the completed Smile album.\nThe compilation is the first and only package devoted to the 1960s Smile recordings originally produced by Brian Wilson, arriving after decades of public anticipation and numerous false starts. The project was led primarily by audio engineers Alan Boyd, Mark Linett, and Capitol A&R director Dennis Wolfe, with Wilson acting as a remote supervisor, assisting the engineers with some mixing decisions. Previously, Wilson had completed a solo album based on Smile in 2004, which Boyd, Linett, and Wolfe used as a blueprint for The Smile Sessions. Wilson later stated that, while the compilation is \"not a far cry\" from his original vision, he prefers his 2004 version.\nThe Smile Sessions received virtually unanimous critical acclaim upon release. It was ranked number 381 in Rolling Stone's 2012 list of the greatest albums of all time and won the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. A spiritual successor, 1967 \u2013 Sunshine Tomorrow, followed in 2017."

Although the band performed well together, relationships among the various band members were strained. In particular, singer Rod Evans left and rejoined the band several times beginning in 1971, and made his departure permanent in late 1973, after the release of the band's second album."

Nine episodes were filmed in Los Angeles, which CBS hoped would draw a younger audience to the network.\nWhile premiering to decent ratings, subsequent episodes suffered from low viewership, and CBS canceled the mid-season replacement before the final episode aired. The show received highly negative reviews from television critics; some named it one of the worst series of 1989 and felt it did not live up to CBS' reputation for airing high-quality programming. They described the writing as childish and thought the content was unoriginal, but were mostly approving of Patrick's role."

His visions lead him to accept cases with little monetary gain but a lot of moral goodness; Stone also predicts an earthquake that hits San Francisco. Other such events occur throughout the course of the series, but the series was cancelled before reaching a coherent conclusion.\nThe series has been met with generally favorable reviews from critics, and both seasons have been released on DVD."

It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen.\nThe breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending.\nReportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.Glens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"\u2014they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.\n\nAccording to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.The breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Paddy Brennan Tinahely Co Wicklow, and Willie Kane Tipperary are recognised as two breeders that revived the breed. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year.[1]\n\nThe current global Glen population size is estimated at 3100.[2]"

It was written and produced by Max Martin and Rami, with additional writing from Dido. The song was released as the second US and third international single from Britney on January 7, 2002, by Jive Records. \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" is a song that speaks about the angst and heartache of adolescence. Spears considered the song inspirational and one of her favorite songs to perform.\n\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" received positive reviews from music critics. The song was considered to be Spears' standout statement on Britney, and was likened to the powerful ballads written by Diane Warren. However, it won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song due to the film that it was paired up with. While the song did not perform well in the United States, \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" reached the top ten in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Sweden and United Kingdom. An accompanying music video for the song was filmed at Antelope Canyon in Page, Arizona and directed by Wayne Isham, being released along with Crossroads (2002), Spears' first film as a protagonist. Spears performed \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\" as part of her Dream Within a Dream Tour, and on several TV and award shows."

It was based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning, and completed by Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive at FN Herstal. Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. FN Herstal named it the \"High Power\" in allusion to the 13-round magazine capacity, almost twice that of other designs at the time, such as the Walther P38 or Colt M1911.\nDuring World War II, Belgium was occupied by Nazi Germany and the FN factory was used by the Wehrmacht to build the pistols for their military, under the designation \"9mm Pistole 640(b)\". FN Herstal continued to build guns for the Allied forces by moving their production line to a John Inglis and Company plant in Canada, where the name was changed to \"Hi Power\". The name change was kept even after production returned to Belgium. The pistol is often referred to as an HP or BHP, and the terms P-35 and HP-35 are also used, based on the introduction of the pistol in 1935. Other names include GP (after the French term grande puissance) or BAP (Browning Automatic Pistol). The Hi-Power is one of the most widely used military pistols in history, having been used by the armed forces of over 50 countries. Although most pistols were built in Belgium by FN Herstal, licensed and unlicensed copies were built around the world, in countries such as Argentina, Hungary, India, Bulgaria, and Israel.\nAfter 82 years of continuous production, FN Herstal announced that the production of the Hi-Power would end, and it was discontinued in early 2018 by Browning Arms. From 2019 to 2022, with new Belgian Hi-Powers no longer being built, new clones were designed by various firearm companies to fill the void, including G\u0130RSAN, T\u0130SA\u015e, and Springfield Armory, Inc. These new Hi-Power clones began competing with each other by offering new finishes, enhanced sights, redesigned hammers, bevelled magazine wells, improved trigger, and increased magazine capacity.In 2022, FN announced they would resume production of the Browning Hi-Power. The 2022 \"FN High Power\" incorporated a number of entirely new features such as a fully ambidextrous slide lock, simplified takedown method, enlarged ejection port, reversible magazine release, wider slide serrations, different colored finish offerings, and 17-round magazines. In contrast to popular belief, the new FN High Power might resemble a modern Hi-Power, but it is, in fact, a different design. One of the noticeable details is the lack of Browning-style locking lugs."

The plot follows United States Army librarian Joe Bauers and prostitute Rita, who undergo a government hibernation experiment. Joe and Rita awake five hundred years later in a dystopian anti-intellectual society. The cast includes Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph, Dax Shepard, Terry Crews, David Herman, Justin Long, Andrew Wilson, and Brad Jordan.\nThe concept of Idiocracy dates back to a concept Judge envisioned in 1996. Judge finished the script for 3001 in 2001, rewriting the film a year later. Filming took place throughout 2004 at Austin Studios and other cities in Texas. Idiocracy serves as a social satire that touches on issues including anti-intellectualism, commercialism, consumerism, dysgenics, and overpopulation. 20th Century Fox was hesitant to promote the film, refusing to grant it a wide release and did not screen the film for critics. The decision not to market Idiocracy was seen as unexpected, following the success of Office Space (1999), and led to speculation. According to Crews, the film's satirical depiction of corporations made the film financially unviable, while Judge attributed 20th Century Fox's decision to negative test screenings; Judge stated that 20th Century Fox believed that the film would develop a cult following through its DVD release, similar to Office Space.\nThe film was released in the United States on September 1, 2006. It was not screened for critics, and the distributor, 20th Century Fox, was accused of abandoning it. Despite its lack of a major theatrical release, which resulted in a mere $495,000 gross at the box office, the film received positive reviews from critics and has since become a cult film."

It is found in the cuisines of the Mediterranean coasts of (Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, Murcia, and eastern Andalusia) and France (Provence, Languedoc, Roussilon).Some versions of the sauce are closer to a garlic mayonnaise, incorporating egg yolks and lemon juice, whereas other versions lack egg yolk and contain more garlic. The latter gives the sauce a pastier texture, making it more laborious to produce as the emulsion is harder to stabilise. There are many variations, such as adding lemon juice or other seasonings. In France, it may include mustard.In Malta, the term arjoli or ajjoli is used for a different preparation made with galletti (a type of cracker), tomato, onion, garlic and herbs.Like mayonnaise, aioli is an emulsion or suspension of small globules of oil and oil-soluble compounds in water and water-soluble compounds. Purists believe aioli should not include egg, but nowadays, egg or egg yolk is the usual emulsifier.\nSince about 1990, it has become common in the United States to call all flavored mayonnaises aioli. Purists insist that flavored mayonnaise can contain garlic, but true aioli contains garlic and no other seasoning (except salt)."

It features a team of superheroes called the X-Men, a group of mutants with superhuman abilities led and taught by Professor X.\nThe title was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, met with a lukewarm reception, and eventually became a reprints-only book in 1970. Interest was rekindled with 1975's Giant-Size X-Men #1 and the debut of a new, international team. Initially under the guidance of artist David Cockrum, writer Len Wein, and especially writer Chris Claremont whose 16-year stint began with August 1975's Uncanny X-Men #94, the series grew in popularity worldwide, eventually spawning a franchise with numerous spin-off \"X-books\" including New Mutants, X-Factor, Excalibur, X-Force, Generation X, and other flagship titles like the simply titled X-Men (later New X-Men and X-Men Legacy), Astonishing X-Men, All-New X-Men, Amazing X-Men, Extraordinary X-Men and X-Men Gold."

The track's name is derived from its meter. The track is written in E\u266d minor and is in ternary (ABA) form.\nReleased as a promotional single in September 1959, the track would not achieve commercial success until it became a sleeper hit in 1961. \"Take Five\" went on to become the biggest-selling jazz single of all time and still receives significant radio airplay."

Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's lead single on October 18, 2005. Written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price, \"Hung Up\" prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's single \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", for which Madonna personally sought permission from its songwriters, Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus. This is one of the few times Andersson and Ulvaeus have given permission to sample one of their songs, following \"Rumble in the Jungle\" by the Fugees and \"Fly With Me\" by 98 Degrees.\nMusically, the song is influenced by pop music from the 1980s, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong, independent woman who has relationship troubles. \"Hung Up\" received critical praise from reviewers, who considered it among Madonna's best dance tracks and believed that the track would restore her popularity, which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album American Life. \"Hung Up\" became a global commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. It was Madonna's 36th top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100, tying her with Elvis Presley as the artist with most top ten entries. It also became the most successful dance song of the decade in the United States. \"Hung Up\" has sold over five million copies worldwide.\nThe music video is a tribute to John Travolta and his movies, and to dancing in general. Directed by Johan Renck, the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink leotard dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people displaying their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the final number of 2006's Confessions Tour, a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 leg of the Sticky & Sweet Tour, and 2012's The MDNA Tour, where the singer performed the song while slacklining."

The band also called the song \"Modern Man\" before the release of their 1990 fifth album Against the Grain, which contained a track by that name.\nThe lyrics and title show Graffin's early affinity for biology and evolutionary science. They refer to Richard Leakey and Robert Lewin's book \"Origins,\" regarding the biological origin and demise of humanity. \u201cTo have arrived on this Earth \u2026 only to depart it through arrogance, would be the ultimate irony.\"The song can also be heard in the movie Glory Daze.

They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, primarily due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona and legal issues. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era's counterculture.The band took its name from the title of English writer Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, itself a reference to a quote by English poet William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors with Morrison recorded and released six studio albums in five years, some of which are generally considered among the greatest of all time, including their self-titled debut (1967), Strange Days (1967), and L.A. Woman (1971). Dubbed the \"Kings of Acid Rock\", they were one of the most successful bands of their time and by 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. They released three more albums in the 1970s, one of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison, and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as \"The Doors of the 21st Century\". Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek\u2013Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.\nThe Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive Gold LPs. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), they have sold 34 million albums in the United States and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In 1993, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."

The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a strange child in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, in the early 1980s.\nA film adaptation of Lindqvist's novel began development in 2004 when John Nordling acquired the rights to produce the project. Alfredson, unconcerned with the horror and vampire conventions, decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters and explore the darker side of humanity. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, K\u00e5re Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were chosen for the leading roles. Leandersson's role in the film was dubbed by Elif Caylan. Principal photography took place in 2007 in Lule\u00e5, with additional filming in Blackeberg. The film was produced by EFTI, Sveriges Television and Filmpool Nord, with support from the Swedish Film Institute, Nordisk Film & TV Fond, WAG and Canal+.\nLet the Right One In premiered at the Gothenburg Film Festival on 26 January 2008, where it received the Nordic Film Prize. It was released in Sweden on 24 October 2008 by Sandrew Metronome. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances of the two leads, the cinematography, screenplay, and direction. It won several awards, including the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival, as well as four Guldbagge Awards, including Best Director for Alfredson, Best Cinematography for Van Hoytema, and Best Screenplay for Lindqvist.

Their first album, Haywire, was produced by Scott McCaughey (lead singer of the Young Fresh Fellows) and recorded for the PopLlama label in 1989.

One of the tracks, \"Boots of Leather\", proved to be an enduring college radio hit.\nIn 1990 the more polished album Bliss was released on Frontier Records. Featuring greatly improved songwriting, this release covered subjects including rape, adolescence, and suicide in a mature fashion built on ragged rock textures. Dharma Bums released their third and final album Welcome in 1992 and then disbanded. Wilson went on to form the alt-rock band Pilot.\nMany in the local Portland scene had expected the Dharma Bums to be a breakthrough alternative rock act of the Northwest music scene. Some biographers, such as Melissa Rossi, author of Courtney Love: Queen of Noise, and Poppy Z Brite, author of Courtney Love: The Real Story, write that Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain first met each other at a Dharma Bums concert in Portland \u2014 when Nirvana served as the opening act.

The film was co-written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, and stars Donatas Banionis and Natalya Bondarchuk. The electronic music score was performed by Eduard Artemyev and features a composition by J.S. Bach as its main theme. The plot centers on a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris, where a scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Banionis) travels to the station to evaluate the situation, only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others. \nSolaris won the Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. It received critical acclaim, and is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema. The film was Tarkovsky's attempt to bring greater emotional depth to science fiction films; he viewed most Western works in the genre, including 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), as shallow due to their focus on technological invention. Some of the ideas Tarkovsky expresses in this film are further developed in his film Stalker (1979)."

        "content": "Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (released in Japan as simply Nemo (\u30cb\u30e2, Nimo) and credited in some territories as Little Nemo) is a 1989 animated musical fantasy film directed by Masami Hata and William Hurtz. Based on the comic strip Little Nemo in Slumberland by Winsor McCay, the film went through a lengthy development process with a number of screenwriters. Ultimately, the screenplay was credited to Chris Columbus and Richard Outten; the storyline and art style differed from the original version. The original soundtrack was penned by the Academy Award-winning Sherman Brothers. The film features the English dub voices of Gabriel Damon, Mickey Rooney, Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, Danny Mann, and Bernard Erhard.\nEven though it derived from an American comic strip, Little Nemo was animated by the Japanese company Tokyo Movie Shinsha and thus is often considered an anime film, although it was a joint production of Japanese and American animators and production companies.\nThe movie was infamous for being in development hell for much of the 1980s, with many people involved with the production at some point before dropping out. Some of those attached to the film worked at Disney, Star Wars, Looney Tunes, and Studio Ghibli. Those who expressed interested or were involved at some stage included George Lucas, Chuck Jones, Ray Bradbury, Isao Takahata, Brad Bird, Jerry Rees, Chris Columbus, Ken Anderson, Frank Thomas, Oliver Johnston, Paul Julian, Osamu Dezaki, the Sherman Brothers (Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman), Hayao Miyazaki (who was working at TMS at the time), and Gary Kurtz.\nThe film was first released in Japan on July 15, 1989, by the Toho-Towa and in the United States on August 21, 1992, by the Hemdale Film Corporation for the dub. It received mixed reviews and was a box-office bomb, earning $11.4 million on a $35 million budget. However, it sold well on home video and has since become a cult film."

Originally written about a cheerful fish swimming freely in the ocean, the song's title is an onomatopoeic phrase suggesting the palpitating heartbeat of a person lovestruck by the object of their affection. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was written by Selena and her backup vocalist and dancer Pete Astudillo.\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" is a Mexican cumbia pop song with rock en espa\u00f1ol and reggae influences. It received widespread acclaim for its musically diverse sounds, and the effects it had on listeners. The single peaked at number one on the United States Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and remained there for four consecutive weeks, the singer's second consecutive number one single. Selena began dominating the Latin music charts, and \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" contributed to her commercial success. It is believed by musicologist Ilan Stavans to have marked the beginning of the dominance of Latin pop, and was a bridge to the Tejano market. The song is considered to be one of the best compositions recorded by Selena, one of her most popular recordings, and has been cited as one of her signature songs. Her Astrodome concert performance of the song has been called one of the highlights of her musical career. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" was ranked at number 54 on the list of the Best Texas Songs of All-time, and given honorable mention as one of the top ten best Tejano recordings of all-time.\nAfter Selena was killed in 1995, the song's title became a popular verb to describe a fan's admiration for the singer. \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" won the Tejano Music Award for Song of the Year, while Broadcast Music Inc. recognized it as the most played Latin song of 1996. Since Billboard began monitoring music downloads in 2010, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" has remained on the Regional Mexican Digital Songs chart for 280 non-consecutive weeks, second to the number of consecutive weeks for her 1992 single \"Como la Flor\". Many musicians have since recorded the song or performed it as a tribute to the singer including: Jennifer Lopez, Selena Gomez, Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n, Kat Von D, and Jennifer Pe\u00f1a."

        "content": "Peer Gynt (, Norwegian: [pe\u02d0r \u02c8j\u028fnt, - \u02c8\u0261\u028fnt]) is a 5-act play in verse by the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen. It is one of the most widely performed Norwegian plays.\nPeer Gynt chronicles the journey of its title character from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert and back. According to Klaus Van Den Berg, \"its origins are romantic, but the play also anticipates the fragmentations of emerging modernism\" and the \"cinematic script blends poetry with social satire and realistic scenes with surreal ones.\" Peer Gynt has also been described as the story of a life based on procrastination and avoidance.Ibsen wrote Peer Gynt in deliberate disregard of the limitations that the conventional stagecraft of the 19th century imposed on drama. Its forty scenes move uninhibitedly in time and space and between consciousness and the unconscious, blending folkloric fantasy and unsentimental realism. Raymond Williams compares Peer Gynt with August Strindberg's early drama Lucky Peter's Journey (1882) and argues that both explore a new kind of dramatic action that was beyond the capacities of the theatre of the day; both created \"a sequence of images in language and visual composition\" that \"became technically possible only in film.\"Ibsen believed Per Gynt, a Norwegian fairy-tale the play is loosely inspired by, to be rooted in fact. Ibsen also wrote that he had used his own family and childhood memories as \"as some kind of model\" for the Gynt family; he acknowledged that the character of \u00c5se\u2014Peer Gynt's mother\u2014was based on his own mother, Marichen Altenburg, while Peer's father Jon Gynt is widely interpreted as based on Ibsen's father Knud Ibsen. He was also generally inspired by Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen's collection of Norwegian fairy-tales, Huldre-Eventyr og Folkesagn, published in 1845.\nThe play was written in Italy and a first edition of 1,250 copies was published on 14 November 1867 by the Danish publisher Gyldendal in Copenhagen. Although the first edition swiftly sold out, a reprint of two thousand copies, which followed after only fourteen days, did not sell out until seven years later.  During Ibsen's lifetime Denmark and Norway had a largely identical written language based on Danish, but Ibsen wrote Peer Gynt in a somewhat modernized Dano-Norwegian that included a number of distinct Norwegian words.Peer Gynt was first performed in Christiania (now Oslo) on 24 February 1876, with original music composed by Edvard Grieg that includes some of today's most recognised classical pieces, \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" and \"Morning Mood\". It was published in German translation in 1881, in English in 1892, and in French in 1896. The contemporary influence of the play continues into the twenty-first century; it is widely performed internationally both in traditional and in modern experimental productions.\nWhile Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson admired the play's \"satire on Norwegian egotism, narrowness, and self-sufficiency\" and described it as \"magnificent\", Hans Christian Andersen, Georg Brandes and Clemens Petersen all joined the widespread hostility, Petersen writing that the play was not poetry. Enraged by Petersen's criticisms in particular, Ibsen defended his work by arguing that it \"is poetry; and if it isn't, it will become such. The conception of poetry in our country, in Norway, shall shape itself according to this book.\" Despite this defense of his poetic achievement in Peer Gynt, the play was his last to employ verse; from The League of Youth (1869) onwards, Ibsen was to write drama only in prose."

It has been owned by the Campbell family since 1921; current president and publisher Ben Campbell is the fourth generation of the family to run the paper.  It is the newspaper of record for both Vancouver and Washougal.Members of The Columbian's editorial board are Scott Campbell, Jody Campbell, Ben Campbell, Craig Brown, Colleen Keller and Greg Jayne."

        "content": "My War is the second full-length studio album by American punk rock band Black Flag. It was the first of three full-length albums the band released in 1984. The album polarized fans due to the LP's B-side, on which the band slowed down to a heavy, Black Sabbath-esque trudge after establishing expectations as a faster hardcore punk band on their first album, Damaged (1981).\nAfter a period of legal troubles which prohibited the band from using its own name on recordings, Black Flag returned to the studio with a new approach to its music that incorporated a greater variety of styles, resulting in a sound orthodox punks found difficult to accept. The line-up had shrunk from five members to three: vocalist Henry Rollins, drummer Bill Stevenson, and co-founding guitarist Greg Ginn. Ginn doubled on bass guitar under the name \"Dale Nixon\" for the recording as bassist Chuck Dukowski left the band shortly before recording; the album includes two tracks Dukowski wrote.\nThe A-side of the LP is composed of six generally high-paced, thrashy hardcore tracks, featuring guitar solos unusual in punk music. On the B-side are three heavy tracks that each breach six-minutes with ponderously slow tempos and dark, unrelenting lyrics of self-hatred. The band members had grown their hair long when they toured the album in 1984, which along with the change in sound further alienated their hardcore skinhead fanbase. Despite mixed reception at the time of the album's release, My War has come to gain a reputation as one of Black Flag's seminal releases and had a major influence on the development of post-hardcore, sludge metal, grunge, and math rock."

Western films were popular for this time.\nConsidered a lost film, a print was found in the State Film Archives of the Soviet Union, which donated it to the Museum of Modern Art in 1969. The film was screened to the public, for the first time since its rediscovery, on March 24 and 25, 1969.

Long's version was dramatized by David Belasco as the one-act play Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan, which, after premiering in New York in 1900, moved to London, where Puccini saw it in the summer of that year.The original version of the opera, in two acts, had its premiere on 17 February 1904 at La Scala in Milan. It was poorly received, despite having such notable singers as soprano Rosina Storchio, tenor Giovanni Zenatello and baritone Giuseppe De Luca in lead roles. This was due in part to a late completion by Puccini, which gave inadequate time for rehearsals. Puccini revised the opera, splitting the second act in two, with the Humming Chorus as a bridge to what became Act III, and making other changes. Success ensued, starting with the first performance on 28 May 1904 in Brescia."

Fuller uses the film as a platform to deliver a message against racism as it examines the question of whether racism is a treatable problem or an incurable condition.\nThe film's theatrical release was suppressed for a week in the United States by Paramount Pictures out of concern over negative press after rumors began circulating that the film was racist. Prior to the date, it was released internationally in France in July 1982. Its first official American home video release came in December 2008 when The Criterion Collection released the original uncut film to DVD.Critics praised the film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors to present his argument, and its somewhat disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion."

These actions originate from Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles left by German armed forces in Norway at the end of World War II in 1945. It is used by both the Norwegian military and police forces, though it was originally designed at the request of the Norwegian Army. The NM149 replaced the Kongsberg M59F1 in the Norwegian Army.\nThe NM149 stock is laminated beech veneer, pillar bedded and is adjustable for length of pull via a spacer system, the barrel is a German made cold-hammered barrel with 4 grooves right hand twist, of heavy contour and the system shoots very well. There was a problem with the early versions of the stock cracking, but that problem has since been solved. The rifles have an easily adjustable match quality trigger, but come from the factory with a pull weight of only 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs). The standard telescopic sight for the Norwegian military and police is a Schmidt & Bender 6\u00d742, but the scope rings are basically NATO standard, and can be removed and replaced with rings which allow the mounting of other Western telescopic sights. They can also be removed entirely, and replaced with a mount allowing the use of most NATO-compatible night vision devices. The rifles were given the serial numbers of the Schmidt & Bender 6\u00d742 telescopic sight to make a matching pair. The system was very capable and effective and served in the Norwegian army from 1988 to 2013. It was replaced in service by the Heckler & Koch HK417.\nAn improved model, the NM149-F1, has since been developed and produced. It has a better and stronger laminated and weatherproofed beech stock, and American heavy contour barrel (diameter 21mm) with a permanent front sight, and a flash suppressor from the AG-3 service rifle. The stock is not pillar bedded, which makes it somewhat more susceptible to weather changes.\nA bipod and suppressor can be fitted as needed."

Kennedy, explaining that he was patched up after the assassination, dyed black, and abandoned.\nIt is based on the novella of the same name by Joe R. Lansdale, which originally appeared in the anthology The King Is Dead: Tales of Elvis Post-Mortem. Originally the film was \"roadshowed\" by the director across the country. Only 32 prints were made and circulated around various film festivals, though this garnered critical success, and it went on to win the Bram Stoker Award for Best Screenplay. By the time it was released on DVD, it had already achieved cult status due to positive reviews, lack of access, and inclusion of Campbell.\nWhile the novella and film revolve around an ancient Egyptian mummy (played by Bob Ivy) terrorizing a retirement home, Bubba Ho-Tep also deals with the deeper theme of aging and growing old in a culture that only values the young.

As a result of the fierce defense of the island and that a Japanese cruiser was sunk, Marines were beheaded on the way to Japan to work as slaves in the mines in Japan."

Bournonville created the work for Denmark's Royal Ballet on December 19, 1858, at the Royal Danish Theatre, on the basis of Danes' general enthusiasm for Italy. The libretto, which is adapted from a tale in Impressions de voyage by Alexandre Dumas, tells the story of a pair of young lovers, Rosa and Paolo, which alludes to the festival still celebrated each June in Genzano, Italy. The music is by Edvard Helsted and Holger Simon Paulli. \nBournonville was a dancer, choreographer, ballet teacher and director. He was son of the dancer and French ballet master Antoine Bournonville, who was a disciple of the great Noverre. Auguste was born in Copenhagen in 1805, studied with his father, and completed his training in France\u2014with Vestris, the last virtuoso of the French classical style\u2014before becoming a star of the Paris opera.\nBournonville's contributions to the development of romantic ballet, in the course of his long reign as head of the Royal Danish Ballet, far outweighed French influence. He created an entire balletic school and style, including a repertoire of more than 50 ballets, most noted for their strong characters, naturalistic (vs. exaggerated) movement, and exotic locales."

Jim Root, who recorded two tracks at this point, would appear full time on subsequent albums starting with their next album Iowa.\nThe album spans several genres, but is generally noted for its extensive percussion and overall heavy sound. It was well received by fans and critics alike and was responsible for bringing Slipknot a large increase in popularity. The album peaked at number 51 on the Billboard 200, and has gone on to become certified double platinum in the United States, making it the band's best-selling album. In 2011, it was voted the best debut album of the last 25 years by readers of Metal Hammer magazine."

They chose Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore to produce the album, with whom they developed a strong rapport. Recording took place from November to December 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nMusically, Revolutions per Minute is rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. Critics noted that the album exhibited greater musical maturity and an overall darker tone when compared to its predecessor. It comprises thirteen songs, with lyrical themes ranging from relationships and politics. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively with other Fat Wreck Chords bands, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour.\nUpon its release, the album peaked at number 35 on the Independent Albums chart, and was praised for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of genres. Some critics called it one of the best albums of the year. According to Bryne Yancey of Punknews.org, Revolutions per Minute not only popularized the melodic hardcore genre, but also influenced \"literally thousands of bands\" with its music and social commentary. The album also introduced several aspects that would become common traits in Rise Against's newer material, such as extensive social commentary, and reliance on musical accessibility. In 2013, Fat Wreck Chords re-released the album with ten bonus demos and expanded packaging."

With a screenplay by Casey Robinson, the film is based on the 1922 novel Captain Blood by Rafael Sabatini and concerns an imprisoned doctor and his fellow prisoners who escape their cruel island captivity to become West Indies pirates. An earlier 1924 Vitagraph silent film version of Captain Blood starred J. Warren Kerrigan as Peter Blood. Warner Bros. risked pairing two relatively unknown performers in the lead roles. Flynn's performance made him a major Hollywood star and established him as the natural successor to Douglas Fairbanks and a \"symbol of an unvanquished man\" during the Great Depression. Captain Blood also established de Havilland, in just her fourth screen appearance, as a major star and was the first of eight films costarring Flynn and de Havilland. In 1938 they would be reunited with Rathbone in The Adventures of Robin Hood. The same year, Rathbone also starred with Flynn in The Dawn Patrol.

A sequel was conceived in 1996 called Larry & Steve, which aired in 1997 as a segment of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. Both shorts caught the attention of Fox, who contacted MacFarlane in 1998 to develop a series based on the films. A hand-drawn pilot was created by MacFarlane with a budget of $50,000, which led to the series being accepted for production and the pilot being remade and extended into its broadcast form.\nCritical responses to the episode were mostly positive.

Their style can be considered a mixture of indie, alternative, punk and folk music, with elements of 1960s and 1970s pop music. Though Means and Ruess are the foremost members of the band, they have played, toured, and recorded with Mike Schey, Mark Buzard, Don Raymond, and for the DVD recording and summer 2007 tour, The Honorary Title's drummer Adam Boyd. The Format chose their name to make fun of the music industry's inclination towards a cookie-cutter \"format\" for a hit. Formed in 2002, the band announced a hiatus on February 4, 2008. On February 4, 2020, they announced a return from their hiatus for a tour of special shows that were later cancelled due to the pandemic."

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 12, 2003. In the episode, Cartman misleads Butters into going missing in order to gain an invitation to Kyle's birthday party. The titular restaurant in the episode is based on the real-life Casa Bonita, a Mexican-themed restaurant in Lakewood, Colorado.\nThe episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. The show's writing team had the idea of Cartman convincing Butters to disappear long before the episode's production. The rest of the episode's storyline and script were developed in the week preceding its broadcast. The inclusion of Casa Bonita was based on the crew's memories of going there as children; Parker, co-creator Matt Stone, director Eric Stough, and other members of the show's staff had visited the restaurant before. As such, the show's depiction of the restaurant is fairly accurate.\nThe episode received positive reviews from television critics, and is one of Parker's favorite episodes. The real-life restaurant saw an increase in visitors following the episode's airing. In August 2021, Parker and Stone announced that they had struck a deal to purchase the restaurant."

The filmmakers follow a group of young missionaries from the International House of Prayer in their first missionary effort in another nation, as well as interviewing several evangelical leaders from the US and Uganda.\nWilliams was inspired to make God Loves Uganda when he met David Kato, an LGBT activist who was killed in 2011, ostensibly in a robbery. Kato told there was an untold story of the damage American fundamentalist evangelicals are doing in Uganda; of the insidious nature of their aggressive effort to harvest young, unclaimed souls to preach a gospel of love intertwined with a gospel of intolerance.The Dutch premiere of the film was at the Movies that Matter Film Festival in The Netherlands in 2014."

Faergolzia is most well-known for his unusual songwriting and enigmatic voice of over 5 octaves. The band is known for their revolving door membership, with anywhere from two to 25 members on stage. Seth Faergolzia is the extremely prolific mainstay of the group but also tours as a solo artist and with his newer projects Multibird and Forest Creature.. He has performed in over 20 countries and recorded over 40 full-length albums. Faergolzia has worked with ROIR (Reach Out International Records) US, IronMan Records UK, Blang Records UK, Trikont Germany, Rough Trade UK, and most recently Needlejuice Records US. He has written a musical, Fun Wearing Underwear, performed in NYC's Lower East Side for four months.\nDufus, critically acclaimed as an avant-freakout band is noted for its experimentation, revolving door membership, and its communal amiability. Faergolzia's newer project, Multibird, is a present-day band project that ranges from expansive improvisations to raucous toe-tappers to soft, touching, and careful songs.\nFaergolzia's success comes in part because of his continuous work for over 20 years touring and recording constantly, making him an underground anomaly. He is a contemporary of acts such as the Moldy Peaches, Regina Spektor, Diane Cluck, Langhorne Slim, and Dan Deacon.\nFaergolzia's music expresses positivity, creativity, kindheartedness, and social/political change. He is left-leaning in his politics. His music is often described as a circus mixed with an opera mixed with oddball freakfolk.\n \nAs a visual artist, Faergolzia has been featured on the cover of The New York Times art section and was the featured artist in a group show with Jean Paul Basquiat, which The New York Times lauded as \"fiber art going punk.\"\nSeth Faergolzia recently completed a 12 album box set of unreleased music entitled \"Painbow,\" consisting of four solo albums of new works, four solo albums of songs from the early 2000s, and four live albums of his early project Dufus.\nDufus's music is difficult to categorize but is experimental in nature and manages to maintain a melodic center. The band's music is profoundly odd, according to City Newspaper in Rochester, NY, and \"like Johnny Cash on 5 double-espressos,\" according to Die Rheinpfalz in Germany. Village Voice, NYC, describes it as \"As giddy and inventive as it is pissed off, it's the 21st-century equivalent of the Fugs at their finest.\" Pop Matters says, \"I have never heard anything like this before or since.\"\nThe music itself is difficult to pin down. Justin Cober-Lake, in his 1:3:1 review for PopMatters puts it simply, \"If all this sounds crazy to you, you're on the right track.\"In 2010, since the dissolution of Dufus, Seth has been heading an ever-evolving musical endeavor known as Multibird, plus multiple side projects under his name and pseudonyms. He is still an active touring musician."

Halloween III is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist, Michael Myers. After the film's disappointing reception and box office performance, Michael Myers was brought back six years later in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988).\nThe film departs from the slasher genre of the other installments, instead featuring a \"witchcraft\" theme with science fiction aspects. John Carpenter and Debra Hill believed that the Halloween series could have been an anthology series of films that centered around Halloween night, with each sequel containing its own characters, setting, and storyline. Director Wallace stated there were many ideas for Halloween-themed films, some of which could have potentially created any number of their own sequels, and that Season of the Witch was meant to be the first.As with the series' other films, suspense and tension are key themes, exploring violence against young children. On a budget of $4.6 million, Halloween III made a profit by grossing $14.4 million at the box office in the US, but it was also the poorest performing film in the Halloween series at the time. Most critics gave the film negative reviews, though reevaluation in later years has given Halloween III its own reputation as a stand-alone cult film.It was the last Halloween film distributed by Universal Pictures until the 2018 film Halloween 36 years later."

In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) confronts Ivan Drago (Lundgren), a Soviet boxer responsible for a personal tragedy in Balboa's life.\nDevelopment for a fourth Rocky film began soon after the success of Rocky III, which faced controversy after it was subject to a copyright lawsuit. Principal photography began in 1984, with filming locations including Philadelphia, Wyoming, and Vancouver. Rocky IV was Lundgren's American film debut, and Stallone's last directorial effort until 2006; they engaged in authentic punching in their fight scenes, which led to Stallone being admitted to intensive care. Filming also featured new special effects and bona fide and groundbreaking sport methods and equipment, some of which were years removed from public use. Rocky IV is known for its strong Cold War themes, as well as its successful theme songs \"Burning Heart\" and \"Living in America\".\nRocky IV premiered in Los Angeles on November 21, 1985, and was theatrically released in the United States by MGM/UA on November 27. The film received mixed reviews, with criticism for its predictable screenplay and praise for Drago's credibility as a villain. Scholars note that Drago's ultimate defeat and the Soviet crowd's embrace of Rocky represented the dissolution of the Soviet Union, while others criticized the film as propaganda through its Cold War themes and negative portrayals of Russians.The film was a box office success, grossing $300 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film in the franchise and the third highest-grossing film of 1985 domestically and the second highest grossing film worldwide. Critical reception of the film became more favorable in the years later, with praise for the training montages. The film has been considered an icon of 1980s pop culture. In 2021, a director's cut was released with the title Rocky IV: Rocky vs Drago, receiving positive reviews from critics. The sequel, Rocky V, was released in 1990."

The camera crew talks with Mingus conversationally and spends time with him and his daughter so that the film takes on an intimate air.\nThe film highlights their way of life and how political and racial tensions affected people of the 1960s personally. \nThe reason for Reichman's investigation into Mingus\u2019 eviction was to show the lifestyle of a prominent jazz musician and to show how American society was structured during the Civil Rights era. At a time when the Jim Crow laws had recently been rescinded (Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965), there were African Americans who didn't feel they were treated equally; in many cases they weren't. Throughout this film Mingus makes it clear that he believes that society is run for and by \u201cwhite America\u201d and goes on to say that if it were not for his standing as a jazz musician he would not be treated anywhere close to equally.\nIn 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."
