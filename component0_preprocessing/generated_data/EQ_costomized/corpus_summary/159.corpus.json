        "content": "Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC ), using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1960s to the 1990s. The company was co-founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957. Olsen was president until forced to resign in 1992, after the company had gone into precipitous decline. Although the company produced many different product lines over its history, it is best known for the work in the minicomputer market starting in the mid-1960s. The company produced a series of machines known as the PDP line, with the PDP-8 and PDP-11 being among the most successful minis in history. Their success was only surpassed by another DEC product, the late-1970s VAX \"supermini\" systems that were designed to replace the PDP-11. Although a number of competitors had successfully competed with Digital through the 1970s, the VAX cemented the company's place as a leading vendor in the computer space. As microcomputers improved in the late 1980s, especially with the introduction of RISC-based workstation machines, the performance niche of the minicomputer was rapidly eroded. By the early 1990s, the company was in turmoil as their mini sales collapsed and their attempts to address this by entering the high-end market with machines like the VAX 9000 were market failures. After several attempts to enter the workstation and file server market, the DEC Alpha product line began to make successful inroads in the mid-1990s, but was too late to save the company. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. During the purchase, some parts of DEC were sold to other companies; the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002. , decades-old hardware (including PDP-11, VAX, and AlphaServer) is being emulated to allow legacy software to run on modern hardware; funding for this is planned to last at least until 2030."

        "content": "Hamas (, ; , ; an acronym of  , \"Islamic Resistance Movement\") is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist, militant, and nationalist organization. It has a social service wing, Dawah, and a military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. It won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and became the de facto governing authority of the Gaza Strip following the 2007 Battle of Gaza. It also holds a majority in the parliament of the Palestinian National Authority. Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. New Zealand and Paraguay have designated only its military wing as a terrorist organization. It is not considered a terrorist organization by Brazil, China, Egypt, Iran, Norway, Qatar, Russia, Syria and Turkey. In December 2018, the United Nations General Assembly rejected a U.S. resolution condemning Hamas as a terrorist organization. Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Khaled Mashaal are based in Qatar. Hamas was founded in 1987, soon after the First Intifada broke out, as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood which in its Gaza branch had previously been nonconfrontational toward Israel and hostile to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Co-founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin said in 1987, and the Hamas Charter affirmed in 1988, that Hamas was founded to liberate Palestine, including modern-day Israel, from Israeli occupation and to establish an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Since 1994, the group has frequently stated that it would accept a truce if Israel withdraws to the 1967 borders, paid reparations, allowed free elections in the territories and gave Palestinian refugees the right to return. Israel and Hamas have engaged in several wars of varying intensity. Hamas's military wing has launched attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, often describing them as retaliations, in particular for assassinations of the upper echelon of their leadership. Tactics have included suicide bombings and, since 2001, rocket attacks.  Hamas's rocket arsenal, though mainly consisting of short-range homemade Qassam rockets with a range of , also includes Grad-type rockets ( by 2009) and longer-range () that have reached major Israeli towns such as Beer Sheva and Ashdod, and some that have struck cities like Tel Aviv and Haifa. Human Rights Watch has condemned as war crimes and crimes against humanity both Hamas and Israel for attacks on civilians during the conflict, stating that the rationale of reprisals is never valid when civilians are targeted. In the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, Hamas won a majority in the PNA Parliament, defeating the PLO-affiliated Fatah party. After the elections, the Quartet (the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States) made future foreign assistance to the PNA conditional upon the PNA's commitment to nonviolence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected those conditions, which led the Quartet to suspend its foreign assistance program and Israel to impose economic sanctions on the Hamas-led administration. In March 2007, a national unity government headed by Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas was briefly formed, but this failed to restart international financial assistance. Tensions over control of Palestinian security forces soon erupted in the 2007 Battle of Gaza, after which Hamas took control of Gaza, while its officials were ousted from government positions in the West Bank. Israel and Egypt then imposed an economic blockade of the Gaza Strip on the grounds that Fatah forces were no longer providing security there."

In 2005, Lionhead released The Movies and Black & White 2. Lionhead was acquired by Microsoft Studios in April 2006 due to encountering financial difficulties. Many Lionhead developers left around this time, including co-founder Jackson and several developers who left to found Media Molecule. Molyneux left Lionhead in early 2012 (shortly after the resignation of another group of developers who were dissatisfied with the company) to found 22cans because he wanted to be more creative. After Molyneux's departure, Microsoft had Lionhead switch to developing games as a service games. As a result, there were many changes within the studio. In early March 2016, Microsoft announced that it had proposed closing Lionhead Studios and that the planned game Fable Legends would be cancelled; Lionhead was closed down almost two months later, on 29 April. A few months after Lionhead's closure, two key people (Webley and Gary Carr, who was Lionhead's creative director), founded Two Point Studios."

(stylized as SiliconGraphics before 1999, later rebranded SGI, historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American high-performance computing manufacturer, producing computer hardware and software. Founded in Mountain View, California in November 1981 by Jim Clark, its initial market was 3D graphics computer workstations, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time. Early systems were based on the Geometry Engine that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at Stanford University, and were derived from Clark's broader background in computer graphics. The Geometry Engine was the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a geometry pipeline, specialized hardware that accelerated the \"inner-loop\" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market. Silicon Graphics reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity Wintel machines began to erode SGI's stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of Maya to other platforms was a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing MIPS platforms to the Intel Itanium, as well as introducing their own Linux-based Intel IA-32 based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor, a move that also failed. On April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems, a deal finalized on May 11, 2009, with Rackable assuming the name Silicon Graphics International. The remains of Silicon Graphics, Inc. became Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc."

The company seized  control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent, colonised parts of Southeast Asia and Hong Kong after the First Opium War, and maintained trading posts and colonies in the Persian Gulf Residencies. Originally chartered as the \"Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies\", the company rose to account for half of the world's trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, sugar, salt, spices, saltpetre, tea, and opium. The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India. The company eventually came to rule large areas of India, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company rule in India effectively began in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey and lasted until 1858 when, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control of India in the form of the new British Raj. Despite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems with its finances. The company was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act enacted one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete.

It is a federal Crown corporation funded by the government. The English- and French-language service units of the corporation are commonly known as CBC and Radio-Canada, respectively. Although some local stations in Canada predate the CBC's founding, CBC is the oldest existing broadcasting network in Canada. The CBC was established on November 2, 1936. The CBC operates four terrestrial radio networks: The English-language CBC Radio One and CBC Music, and the French-language Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re and Ici Musique. (International radio service Radio Canada International historically transmitted via shortwave radio, but since 2012 its content is only available as podcasts on its website.) The CBC also operates two terrestrial television networks, the English-language CBC Television and the French-language Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, along with the satellite/cable networks CBC News Network, Ici RDI, Ici Explora, Documentary Channel (partial ownership), and Ici ARTV. The CBC operates services for the Canadian Arctic under the names CBC North and Radio-Canada Nord. The CBC also operates digital services including CBC.ca/Ici.Radio-Canada.ca, CBC Radio 3, CBC Music/ICI.mu and Ici.TOU.TV, and owns 20.2% of satellite radio broadcaster Sirius XM Canada, which carries several CBC-produced audio channels. CBC/Radio-Canada offers programming in English, French and eight aboriginal languages on its domestic radio service, and in five languages on its web-based international radio service, Radio Canada International (RCI). However, budget cuts in the early 2010s have contributed to the corporation reducing its service via the airwaves, discontinuing RCI's shortwave broadcasts as well as terrestrial television broadcasts in all communities served by network-owned rebroadcast transmitters, including communities not subject to Canada's over-the-air digital television transition. The CBC's federal funding is supplemented by revenue from commercial advertising on its television broadcasts. The radio service employed commercials from its inception to 1974, but since its primary radio networks have been commercial-free. In 2013, CBC's secondary radio networks, CBC Music and , introduced limited advertising of up to four minutes an hour, but this was discontinued in 2016."

The Brothers Radi\u0107 believed that the realization of Croatian statehood was possible within Austria-Hungary, but that it had to be reformed as a Monarchy divided into three equal parts \u2013 Austria, Hungary, Croatia. After the creation of Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918, Party requested for the Croatian part of the Kingdom to be based on self-determination. This brought them great public support which culminated in 1920 parliamentary election when HPSS won all 58 seats assigned to Croatia. In 1920, disgruntled with a bad position of Croats in the Kingdom, the party changed its name into Croatian Republican Peasant Party (HRSS) and started advocating secession from the Kingdom and the establishment of \"peaceful peasant Republic of Croatia\". On 1923 and 1925 election, HRSS doubled the number of won votes, and has thus become the second largest party in the Parliament. In 1927, faced with a constant prosecution by the regime, HRSS was forced to soften its policy, change its name into Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), recognize the Vidovdan Constitution and form a coalition with Serbian People's Radical Party. This resulted in HSS losing its popularity which was seen in 1927 election when it lost almost third of votes won in the previous elections. After termination of the coalition agreement with the Radicals, HSS formed Peasant-Democratic Coalition with Pribi\u010devi\u0107's Independent Democratic Party. In 1928, Vladko Ma\u010dek become the new president of HSS after the assassination of Stjepan Radi\u0107. After King Alexander declared dictatorship in 1929, HSS was banned and its members prosecuted. HSS participated in the 1935 and 1938 election as a part of the United opposition coalition which helped it to regain its influence. In 1939, Cvetkovi\u0107\u2013Ma\u010dek Agreement helped in the establishing of the HSS-governed Banovina of Croatia. After the establishment of Nazi-puppet state, the so-called Independent State of Croatia (NDH) in 1941, HSS was banned once again, with half of its members joining either Usta\u0161e or Partisans, and part staying loyal to Ma\u010dek who believed that the victory of Allies would bring liberal democracy into Croatia and that HSS would return to power. In May 1945, Ma\u010dek left the country, while HSS split into two fractions which boycotted the 1945 election because of their opposition to the Communists. During the period of SFR Yugoslavia (1945\u20131991), HSS was active abroad. On 25 May 1991 HSS was restored under the leadership of Drago Stipac at the so-called Assembly of Unification. The party first entered Government after 2000 elections, on which it participated as part of liberal coalition (HSS-IDS-HNS-LS-SDA), with Ivica Ra\u010dan (SDP) serving as Prime Minister and its president Zlatko Tom\u010di\u0107 as Parliament Speaker. After HSS lost 2003 election, it moved to the opposition. In 2007 election, HSS formed yet another liberal coalition (HSLS-PGS-ZDS-ZS) and eventually ended up leading Ministries of Tourism and Agriculture in the Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II, and Ministries of Tourism and Regional Development in the Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor. In 2011 election party won only 1 seat in the Parliament as has moved to the opposition. In 2015 election HSS won 1 seats as part of the conservative Patriotic Coalition, and supported Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 as Prime Minister.

        "content": "RENAMO (from the Portuguese , ) is a Mozambican political party and militant group. The party was founded with the active sponsorship of the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) in May 1977 from anti-communist dissidents opposed to Mozambique's ruling FRELIMO party. RENAMO was initially led by Andr\u00e9 Matsangaissa, a former senior official in FRELIMO's armed wing, and was composed of several anti-communist dissident groups which appeared immediately prior to, and shortly following, Mozambican independence. Matsangaissa, who died in 1979, was succeeded by Afonso Dhlakama, who led the organization until his death in 2018. He was succeeded by Ossufo Momade. Critics of RENAMO frequently described the movement as a proxy of Rhodesia and latterly, South Africa's apartheid government. It has been theorised that RENAMO was formed for the sole purpose of countering FRELIMO support for Rhodesian insurgent groups, namely the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). On the other hand, RENAMO was also reflective of FRELIMO's own splintering support base and dwindling popularity in the immediate post-independence era. Its political programme centered around the abandonment of FRELIMO's socialist policies, the adoption of a free market economy, and more traditionalist concerns such as the reinstatement of tribal leaders to positions of authority. RENAMO's ranks included a number of Mozambican political exiles who genuinely opposed FRELIMO on principle, including FRELIMO defectors disillusioned with its Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology, but also large numbers of recruits conscripted by force. With Rhodesian support, RENAMO commenced an insurgency against the FRELIMO government in 1977, sparking the Mozambican Civil War. The war was characterised by severe human rights violations on both sides and crippled the already debilitated Mozambican economy. RENAMO and FRELIMO acceded to the Rome General Peace Accords in October 1992, which ended FRELIMO's oneparty state and introduced multi-party democratic elections. In return, RENAMO pledged to abandon its armed struggle and conduct its future activities by political means within the framework of the new electoral system. Following the end of the war, RENAMO was responsible for promoting constitutional reforms as well as the promotion of a strong domestic private sector. Renewed clashes broke out between RENAMO's militant forces and the FRELIMO government in 2013. RENAMO resumed its insurgency, citing state corruption and electoral fraud perpetuated by FRELIMO officials. A second peace agreement was reached between RENAMO and FRELIMO in August 2019, resulting in the virtual end of the insurgency. A RENAMO splinter group known as the RENAMO Military Junta (RMJ) was quickly formed from party dissidents opposed to the peace process; the RMJ continued to carry out minor guerrilla operations until December 2021, when the last of its members surrendered to Mozambican security forces."

In 2008, financial issues resulted in a period of examinership, and the club's then holding company was wound up in 2010. A team was entered into the 2010 League of Ireland First Division, before the club re-acquired rights to the name \"Cork City Football Club\", and was promoted back to the premier division for the 2012 season. Cork City FC won its third premier division title, and first FAI Cup double, during the 2017 season. Following the 2020 League of Ireland Premier Division, the club were relegated to the League of Ireland First Division. The club's traditional colours are green and white with red trim, and the crest is a variant of the Cork coat of arms. City's home games are played at Turners Cross.

It currently holds fifteen of the 64 Christian seats in Lebanon's parliament and is therefore the second-largest Christian party in parliament. The organization was created in 1976 by Pierre and Bachir Gemayel, Camille Chamoun, and other party leaders during the Lebanese Civil War. It was initially an umbrella organization coordinating all the right-wing party militias of the Lebanese Front and served as the main resistance force of the front. The Kataeb Regulatory Forces provided the largest share of fighters, and the Kataeb Party had the largest share on the council. Despite its original creation from party militias, the Lebanese Forces accepted new recruits without any specific party allegiance. During the civil war, the Lebanese Forces fought different opponents at different times: the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the Lebanese National Movement, the Lebanese National Resistance Front, the Syrian Army, the Druze-dominated Progressive Socialist Party in the Chouf, and the Lebanese Army loyal to General Michel Aoun. After the assassination of its leader, Bachir Gemayel, in 1982, political friction within the Lebanese Front resulted in growing distance between the Kataeb militants and the rest of the Lebanese Forces. In the end, the Lebanese Forces and Kataeb became two separate forces within the Lebanese Front. A few uprisings led to Lebanese Forces commander-in-chief Samir Geagea taking over and dissolving the Lebanese Front in the late 1980s. After the civil war ended, Geagea created the Lebanese Forces Party. In 1994, while Lebanon was under Syrian occupation, the party was banned, Geagea imprisoned and the activities of its militants repressed by the Lebanese services in Lebanon. The Lebanese Forces returned as a political force after the Cedar Revolution in early 2005, which resulted in a withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Soon after, Geagea was subsequently released from prison and continues to lead the party today."

The team's first choice strip was red shirts, black shorts and red socks. Their second strip was gold and black shirts, black shorts and black socks. They used to play their football at Cardiff Athletics Stadium in Leckwith. The Quins were formed in 1935, and progressed in the 1990s from 'parks' football into the Welsh League, via the FAW Pyramid system. The club won the Welsh League Challenge Cup in 1995. In the 2005\u201306 season, they played in the Welsh Premier League. However, a lack of finances and fan support led to the departure of key players, leaving the club to rely on youth and reserve players. The 'Quins' remained rooted to the bottom of the table, and never looked able to avoid relegation. A second relegation followed in 2006\u201307, and the club's prospects of returning to the Premier in the short term looked slim. With the demolition of the old Cardiff Athletics Stadium in 2007 Grange Quins lost their home ground. Because a replacement was not due to be completed until late 2009 the Quins had nowhere to play and, in any case, were considering withdrawing from the Welsh League because of the far higher costs of playing at the new Cardiff International Sports Stadium. The club had a long-standing rivalry with fellow Cardiff side Cardiff Corinthians which dated back to the 1980s, when both clubs were fierce cross-city rivals and took part in some mouth-watering fixtures. Both clubs have rarely been in the same division, but the rivalry resumed in 2014\u201315 with the Corinthians relegation to Division 3. In 2014\u201315 the Cardiff Grange Harlequins resigned from the Welsh League towards the end of the season and their record was expunged. The team continued to play in the Cardiff & District League for a season, though with none of the players that played in the Welsh League, using the park facilities at Pontcanna Fields as their home ground.   The club folded shortly afterwards."

Its primary function is to determine and set the official standards for the Valencian language as used in the Valencian Community (known in other territories as Catalan), and foster its use. According to its foundational law, the AVL linguistic regulations for Valencian must follow current Valencian genuine linguistic reality, respect Valencian lexicographic and literary tradition and start from the consolidated regulations based upon the Normes de Castell\u00f3, a set of orthographic rules for Valencian signed in 1932. The headquarters of the Acad\u00e8mia Valenciana de la Llengua are in Valencia. In addition this variety of the language follows the pattern of Pompeu Fabra standards who standardized the Catalan language in Catalonia. The AVL linguistic rule does not differ a great deal from the IEC (Institute for Catalan Studies) standards. Nevertheless, AVL grammar (Gram\u00e0tica normativa valenciana) includes some specific features of Valencian syntax, and its dictionary (Diccionari normatiu valenci\u00e0) contains thousands of words which are specific for the Valencian variety, as well as Valencian specific verb conjugation and some accent marks which differ from the Catalan language in Catalonia."

Kvint products are certified 'Made in Moldova'. Founded in 1897, the company produced only vodka until 1938, when it began producing brandies. It is the oldest still-operating commercial enterprise in the region. Locals consider KVINT a national treasure and a symbol of their country. Its factory is shown on the 5 Transnistrian ruble banknote. KVINT is one of Transnistria's largest exporters, to Italy and China as well as Russia and Ukraine; its brandy has gone to the Vatican and into space. Transnistria lies east of the Dniester River. The grapes grown here are Cognac variety. KVINT's award-winning Prince Wittgenstein brandy incorporates \"Bianca, Aligot\u00e9, Pervenets of Magarach [Pervenet Magaracea], Riesling, Riton, Suruchensky White, Ugni Blanc, [and] Colombard\" grapes. The company also grows traditionally European red grapes, such as \"Malbec, Ancelotti, Saperavi, Viognier, [and] Syrah (Shiraz).\" The company was privatized in 2006 and is owned by the conglomerate Sheriff Ltd. Bottles are labeled \"Made in Moldova\" because Transnistria, landlocked inside Moldova, is not recognized as a sovereign country and bottles must be printed with the name of a country of origin.  Its annual production is approximately ten million litres of alcoholic drinks. In 2014 its annual revenues were about $50 million, about 5% of Transnistria's GDP. KVINT obtained ISO 9001-94 certification in 2000 and ISO 9001-2000 in 2003. The factory is one of only a few enterprises in the former Soviet Union which can assure a kosher production process. Daily tours on weekdays at 15:00 local time (conducted in English and Russian) are undertaken, and end with a sampling of six kinds of brandy."

In 2021 the company had 135+ TV channels available. Digital TV was introduced in 1997. A broadband service that used the company's proprietary cable network was launched in 1999. In 2004 VoIP telephone was introduced and the company became Sweden's first nationwide triple play service provider. All households connected to the Com Hem Cable Network had access to broadband Internet services, services, fixed-line telephony and a wide range of TV channels. Com Hem also provided interactive services that facilitated management, communication and maintenance for property owners.

The idea was that by working together they could achieve more than as separate organisations. That philosophy has prevailed throughout Leeds Fed's history, with partnerships and joint working arrangements being a common feature of its work over the years. The Association grew quickly through the 1970s and early 1980s with a lot of pre 1919 stock. Jim Coulter established the association and was the director for 12 years before going on to become the Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation.  New build development was undertaken through Leeds Partnership Homes during the early 1990s, leading to the present day where its 4,300 homes are roughly half pre-1919 stock and half new build stock Most of its homes are in Leeds, but through the 1990s they started developing outside Leeds and now have around 400 homes in Harrogate and 100 in Wakefield. The association's aim is to provide a benefit to the whole community through the provision of housing and associated services. Most of its services are directed at renting homes people want to live in, for less than they could be rented from the private sector. However, through supported housing, it also provides services specifically designed to help people with particular needs, for example older people, people with disabilities (physical or mental), refugees and women fleeing domestic violence.

Systematic vehicle production started in 1968 (although its predecessors had been building bus and truck bodies before World War II), while the company built a modern vehicle assembly factory in the north of Athens in 1971. A large number of Mazda, Opel and, later, Alfa Romeo models were assembled \u2013 usually with a significant proportion of parts locally produced. The company also introduced modified versions of Mazda trucks, including longer versions of the B1500 and B1600 light trucks. A number of the latter was also produced with the company\u2019s own Grezda brand name in the early 1980s (the name stands for \"Greek\" and \"Mazda\"), mostly for export. Emporiki Autokiniton was seriously affected by problems largely connected with the labor unrest of the 1980s in Greece and production was eventually terminated in 1985, after a failed attempt to produce a jeep and a 2-tonne truck type of own development. This evolution in a way represented the fate of the Greek vehicle producing sector, which, except for the \"indigenous\" companies, included a number of companies involved in vehicle assembly and license production. In the early 1980s conditions in Greece seemed favorable for the expansion of this activity, and a number of foreign companies (including Hyundai, during its early steps in Europe) had expressed interest in creating assembly and production facilities in the country. However, a number of reasons, the most important of which being the lack of interest of Greek governments in the particular industrial sector, lead to its decline and virtual disappearance. In 1995, Teocar, the largest Greek vehicle assembly company ceased production after 170,000 Nissans/Datsuns had been produced; its state-of-the-art factory in Volos, modernized only a few years earlier, was dismantled and sold to Russia."

Pixley, who built it into a highly regarded publication. Under Pixley's stewardship it was considered \"the leading literary production of the San Francisco press and was a powerful influence in State and municipal politics.\" The magazine was known for containing strong political Americanism combined with art and literature. Many 19th-century writers such as Ambrose Bierce, Yda Addis, and Gertrude Atherton Frances Dawson appeared regularly in its pages. It was considered one of the most important publications in California, and it had a great deal of political influence. As a staunch Republican, Pixley used The Argonaut to support Leland Stanford and other owners of the Central Pacific Railroad. Pixley, who served as The Argonaut's editor and publisher, had been California's eighth attorney general when Stanford was governor. The journal was founded as a counterweight to Denis Kearney, an Irish-born labor leader who represented many of the Irish immigrants who worked for the railroad. Pixley, who wanted someday to become governor of California himself, was said to have handed out gold coins to sway voters. Jerome Hart became editor in 1891. Pixley sold the journal before his death in 1895 for $11,000.00. This period was seen as a low point in the Argonaut's quality. Alfred Holman purchased the newspaper in 1907, shortly after selling all his interests in the Sacramento Union. He served as publisher and editor until 1924. The name 'Argonaut' comes from the local term for gold prospectors, argonaut."

The electrical and mechanical engineering departments, basic sciences, and department of modern languages were the original departments of the academy. It became a part of Y\u0131ld\u0131z University in 1982. On July 1992, the Turkish government decided to build 22 universities nationwide, including Kocaeli University. Before the 1999 \u0130zmit earthquake, which can be regarded as the turning point for the rebirth of the university, Kocaeli University had approximately 20,000 students, 1,150 educational staff and a campus of 650,000 square meters. Kocaeli University lost nearly 75% of its physical structure in the earthquake, but its prior expansion site Arslanbey Campus rapidly compensated for the university's losses. The university moved to Umuttepe Campus in 2004. Kocaeli University's central Umuttepe Campus is located just outside Izmit in the region of Kocaeli, the most heavily industrialized region of Turkey. Most of its faculties are in this campus, except the Faculty of Fine Arts, the Faculty of Architecture & Design, the Faculty of Dentistry, and the Faculty of Animal Husbandry. Istanbul is only  away, and its secondary international airport was developed on a site  from Izmit, making the university much more accessible in recent years. Since Kocaeli is a near neighbour of Istanbul, many of its students come from Istanbul. The university has established a department of international relations which monitors Bologna developments closely and oversees KOU's participation in the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci student mobility schemes. With membership in the European University Association, KOU is aiming for greater international recognition of its academic work. The university, while focusing on technical and engineering subjects, offers an extensive selection of courses in social sciences and arts as well. Some steps toward certification by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) are being taken by the Faculty of Engineering, such as adaptation of course content in engineering majors."

Other unusual features included push-button exposure and focus controls and an integrated rechargeable battery. The camera used standard 828 rollfilm packaged in a proprietary snap-in cartridge which had to be returned to the company for processing. It was aimed mainly at women, marketed as a \"goof-proof\" alternative to traditional cameras. Although innovative, the Fotron was also extremely expensive, unwieldy, and reportedly suffered from poor optical quality. Introduced at a list price of $139.95, by 1971 the camera was selling for $520 (), plus $3.98 per 10-exposure roll for film and processing (). Despite this, Traid claimed the cameras were sold at a loss and only the film processing operation was able to turn a profit. Due to the high price, vendor lock-in of film and processing, and aggressive direct selling techniques used to market the camera, it is often regarded as something of a scam. Traid faced multiple class-action lawsuits brought by Fotron customers and stopped selling the camera in 1971."

As a child, Sammy Davis, Jr. used to tap dance in front of the restaurant for change. Charlie's has been described as \"equal parts old-school diner and neighborhood coffee shop\", but among the locals it is known for its breakfasts. It has been open since 1927 and has no bathrooms. There are only 32 seats, 13 of which lie along a counter across from wooden refrigerators purchased in 1927, used. Charlie's was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 32 straight years. When Charlie's finally decided to close on Sundays, nobody had a key, and one needed to be made. The floor above Charlie's was a union hall for the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first black porters union founded by A. Philip Randolph. Charlie's has won numerous awards over the years, culminating in the reception of a James Beard Foundation Award in 2005 in the category of America's Classics. There is now a web-project history of the restaurant entitled Where Hash Rules. The story was written by George Aaron Cuddy; original photographs were taken by Brooke T. Wolin. On May 12, 2014, Charlie's announced that it was closing at the end of June 2014, ending its 87-year run.

Shortly before World War II the party had 200,000 members, being the largest opposition party of that time. In the 1930s the two main factions competed within the party, the \"old generation\" and \"young generation\", divided by the age and political programmes. The old generation supported the parliamentary means of political competition, while the activist young generation advocated the extra-parliamentary means of political struggle. In 1935 the young activists took over the leadership of the party. In 1934 a significant part of the young faction split off from the SN, forming the National-Radical Camp.

(formerly Sunnybrook Technologies) was a firm spun-out from the Structured Surface Physics Laboratory of the University of British Columbia, developing and commercializing electronic display technologies, specifically high brightness display technology called HDR. The privately held company also developed technology for capturing, processing, and storage of HDR images. BrightSide's headquarters were in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was acquired by Dolby Laboratories, Inc. in April 2007 for US$28 million. The Chief Executive Officer of BrightSide Technologies Inc. was Richard MacKellar. The   Chief Technology Officer was Helge Seetzen, who went on to join Dolby as becoming director of HDR Technology at Dolby (2008 to 2010), before going on to found TandemLaunch, a Montreal-based technology incubator. The main electronic display technology developed by BrightSide was based on IMLED-LCD which consisted of a LCD with an array of individually modulated LED semiconductors as the backlights, instead of cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) that diffuse light in a layer of plastic. Each LED has 256 brightness steps, where step 0 switches the LED off and step 255 switches it to maximum luminance. As a result, the device can display true black and very bright white, with a contrast ratio technically of infinity, where minimal luminance is 0\u00a0cd/m2 (the denominator) and maximal luminance is almost 4,000\u00a0cd/m2. To address the confusion that may accompany a display with a quoted contrast ratio of infinity, Brightside calculates its quoted contrast ratio using the next-darkest level available on the display to arrive at a contrast ratio of 200,000:1. BrightSide produced a prototype display to showcase their technology: the DR37-P. Targeted industries include the medical field, CAD, film post-production, geophysical data and satellite imaging. On April 25, 2007 Dolby Laboratories, Inc. announced that it completed the acquisition of Brightside Technologies. (Dolby, the company responsible for licensing its surround-sound technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers.)  Dolby renamed the BrightSide technology to Dolby Vision.  In 2009, SIM2 Multimedia announced the professional version of their Solar Series display using it would be available Q2 2010 with 16 bits per color, and a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 (19.9 stops). In 2011, Sony announced that they had acquired the license to use the Dolby Vision technology in their Bravia LCD HDTVs. In 2010 Dolby released the Dolby Professional Reference Monitor (Dolby PRM-4200), followed by the PRM-4220 in 2013.  The Dolby team who developed the Dolby Professional Reference Monitor received an Oscar at the 2016 Academy Awards.  Among the Dolby employees on stage to receive the award was Thomas Wan, one of the BrightSide employees who originally started working on the technology while a student at the University of British Columbia."

The Prussian Army had its roots in the core mercenary forces of Brandenburg during the Thirty Years' War of 1618\u20131648. Elector Frederick William developed it into a viable standing army, while King Frederick William I of Prussia dramatically increased its size and improved its doctrines. King Frederick the Great, a formidable battle commander, led the disciplined Prussian troops to victory during the 18th-century Silesian Wars and greatly increased the prestige of the Kingdom of Prussia. The army had become outdated by the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, and France defeated Prussia in the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806. However, under the leadership of Gerhard von Scharnhorst, Prussian reformers began modernizing the Prussian Army, which contributed greatly to the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte during the War of the Sixth Coalition. Conservatives halted some of the reforms, however, and the Prussian Army subsequently became a bulwark of the conservative Prussian government. In the 19th century the Prussian Army fought successful wars against Denmark, Austria and France, allowing Prussia to unify Germany, aside from Austria, establishing the German Empire in 1871. The Prussian Army formed the core of the Imperial German Army, which was replaced by the Reichswehr after World War I."

        "content": "York Barbell is an American-based international manufacturer of fitness products. Bob Hoffman, named \"Father of World Weightlifting\" by the International Weightlifting Federation, bought the Milo Barbell Company and founded York Barbell in 1932. As a prolific writer of books and articles, Hoffman promoted the benefits of exercise and nutrition. Among the company's first employees were weightlifters Tony Terlazzo and John Terpak. Hoffman starting creating barbells in 1929, the same year he began to host meets in the oil burner factory. During the 1932, Los Angeles Olympics, Hoffman noticed how the teams from other countries looked down upon the America weightlifting team. The same year Hoffman opened the York Barbell Company and began promoting weightlifting. Hoffman reached out to ostracized minorities of the time to train and compete at York Barbell. During the Second World War, York Barbell supplied barbells to the United States military. When the war ended, the demand for barbells increased due to the military personnel returning home who had been exposed to weightlifting during the war. After the war, company machinist Frank Spellman won a gold medal at the 1948 Olympics in Men's 75 kg Weightlifting, setting Olympic middleweight (165 pound) records in the clean & jerk (336.25 pounds) and the total lift (859.5 pounds). From the decades of the 1930s through the 1970s, York Barbell sponsored over 40 national champions and numerous Olympic gold medalists, a few of whom are featured in one of the murals of York, Pennsylvania. Today, the corporate office of York Barbell Company houses the official Weightlifting Hall of Fame and Museum and continues to host a variety of powerlifting and bodybuilding competitions. For a time, the company had a food supplement business, which was involved in several violations of the law. During several occasions (1960, 1961, 1968, 1972 and 1974), the company's products were seized by the Food and Drug Administration, and in a 1968 consent decree it agreed to stop a long list of questionable health claims for their products. The fact that Bob Hoffman owned this company, was a weightlifting coach and a founding member of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, as well as Hoffman's athletic career, helped make him \"a major factor in the growth of nutritional fads for athletes\", according to alternative medicine critic Stephen Barrett."

The company owns 28 Iore locomotives and 750 hopper cars. Each train is 68 cars long and weighs , allowing the company to transport 33 million tonnes per year. Traditionally the ore hauling had been done by the Swedish State Railways (SJ) and Norwegian State Railways (NSB). In the late 1980s, LKAB started a process to take over operations and increase efficiency by using heavier and longer trains. Because of the profitability in the operations, especially NSB was reluctant to lose the operations. In 1993, LKAB received permission to operate their own trains in Sweden, and from 1996 in Norway. MTAB and MTAS were created in 1996 when they took over the hauling formerly operated by NSB and SJ. It inherited Dm3 and El 15 locomotives. Originally established as a joint venture between LKAB, NSB and SJ, with the mining company as a majority owner, LKAB bought the whole company in 1999. By 2011, the renewal process will be finished, and only trains pulled by Iore will be in operation."

Mining resumed in 1947 and commenced in Pyramiden in 1955. Declining coal deposits resulted in Grumant being closed in 1961.

It operated as an open-ended investment trust in Canada, and was one of the equities known as \"Canroys\" \u2013 short for \"Canadian royalty trusts.\"    In 2009 the Korea National Oil Corporation made a buyout offer for Harvest, which was accepted, with shareholder approval.  The trust was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2009. The former Harvest Energy Trust's oil fields are mainly in Alberta, with two in Saskatchewan; it also has assets in northern British Columbia known as the Hay River Field.  Oil sand deposits and all natural gas properties were in Alberta.  As of the end of 2007, Harvest claimed a production of 61,000 BOE/d (barrels or equivalent per day), and a probable lifespan of existing assets of about ten years, before depletion.  It claims a total original oil in place (OOIP) amount of , and another  in oil sands.  Future plans include drilling approximately 1,000 new oil and gas wells on about  of land which has previously not been developed for oil and gas production. Harvest Energy Trust was formed in July, 2002.  In 2006 it purchased the  North Atlantic Refinery in Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador from Vitol Refining Group, B.V., and in so doing became the first Canadian energy trust to own its own refinery.  Harvest had 924 employees and a market capitalization of US$3.22 billion at the end of 2007.  On 22 December 2009, Harvest closed its Plan of Arrangement with the Korea National Oil Corporation, which offered C$10.00 per unit through its Canadian subsidiary, KNOC Canada Ltd.  Unitholders received cash payouts in late December, with non-Canadian holders receiving payouts based on the exchange rate as of the date of closing. The Harvest Energy Trust paid a high dividend, for example yielding an annual rate of 16.0% in early 2008; it also paid out monthly, a relative rarity for equities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  Its dividend payments were not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather at a 15% \"Qualified Dividends\" rate; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to many royalty trusts."

In May 2009, Lucas Entertainment announced that it was filming on location the first gay porn film with only Israeli models, billing it as an effort to promote Israeli culture. The company subsequently launched its Men of Israel microsite introducing the actors and film concept. Lucas has called the film his most important, and journalists from The Atlantic, Out Magazine and Yediot Aharonot noted it as a landmark film as the first pornographic film shot on location with an all-Israeli cast; while Tablet Magazine and the Los Angeles Times remarked on it being the first to feature an all-Jewish cast. In July, the studio announced on Lucas's blog that it will open a European headquarters in Paris, the site of its current production, Paris Playboys.

Key membership benefits of ARAuBiH include the sponsorship of amateur radio operating awards and radio contests, and a QSL bureau for those members who regularly communicate with amateur radio operators in other countries.  ARAuBiH publishes a specialty radio and electronics magazine called RADIO T9.  ARAuBiH represents the interests of the amateur radio operators of Bosnia and Herzegovina before national, European, and international telecommunications regulatory authorities.  ARAuBiH is the national member society representing Bosnia and Herzegovina in the International Amateur Radio Union. Amateur Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in Sarajevo in 1947. Around the same time, the local unions were established in other major cities of the Republic. By the 1950s, activity mostly boiled down to simple homemade amateur radio equipment. This has helped to create the conditions for the establishment of more complex forms of communication in the country and beyond. The first ham radio contact in BiH was on 6 July 1950. This prompted further development of amateur radio in Bosnia and Herzegovina, exhilarating Alliance to begin organizing federal, republican and club competitions. During the seventies, the Bosnian-Herzegovinian hams have increasingly sophisticated radio equipment and antenna systems, and begin to make better placements in national and international competitions. After the outbreak of war in Croatia in 1991, and BH hams begin sending news about these events through short and ultrashort waves. After the outbreak of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992. The phone systems were largely cut off from the vast majority parts of the country, and the inner regions were completely blocked. Ham radio work has become vitally important in such circumstances. Hams were used for the first time in April 1992 to send information to other parts of Europe and the world about the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Messages were sent to individuals, governments, the media, humanitarian organizations and religious communities. In many cases, ham radio was the only way for the Bosnians to stay in touch with their loved ones who have been out of the country, and the only way for people from around the world to obtain information about their families and friends who have been under siege. It is estimated that during the war more than three million messages exchanged, and about 1,500 young people passed their first exam and become amateur radio operators. Hams from neighboring countries, Europe and the rest of the world the most help in the exchange of humanitarian messages during the war of 1992-96. At the beginning of 1993, The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina joins International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as an independent state and a member of the UN gets prefix T9. The association of radio amateurs of Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) on 27 December 1993. Merit Association hams Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized by the International League of Humanists on 16 November 1999 in Trieste and awarded in recognition of the work and contributions during the war. So far, there are 4173 amateur radio licenses issued by ARAuBiH. They are registered in the database ARAuBiH. The current number of members ARAuBiH, who have paid the fee for the current year, is about 850. ARAuBiH has diversified repeater network and the network of digital communication that helps in connecting with the world. Every year we organize a lot of socializing and BH amateur championships in various disciplines. Amateur radio operators from Bosnia and Herzegovina participate in the work of all the major international amateur radio organizations, and our competitors usually end up near the top in all major international competitions. ARAuBiH also became the first member of CEPT from all other Union resulting from the disintegration of former Yugoslavia. In 1999, ARAuBiH began to publish a specialized magazine for electronics and telecommunications, \"Radio T9\", which is also distributed in other European countries.

Medical supervision and direction for Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center are provided by a Chief Medical Officer also appointed by the board of trustees. Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center's mission is to partner with the community to help save and sustain lives by providing a safe supply of blood, biotherapies, and related services. There is no substitute for blood. It must be voluntarily donated by one person to be given to another. The need for different blood components\u2013red blood cells, platelets, and plasma\u2013is constant. Donating on an ongoing basis helps ensure blood components are always available for the patients we serve. As a 501 (c) (3)  nonprofit, the patients and donors served are at the heart of everything. Every donor is a hero to the families they impact each time they give blood. To meet the blood demands in the community, Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center needs about 1,000 donations a day, and all blood donors in the U.S. must be unpaid volunteers. Those units of blood are a vital lifeline for Houston's health care industry and are used in surgeries, cancer treatments and various medical procedures. That is why Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center asks community members to Commit for Life, a partnership between the community and Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, focused on saving lives today, and in the future."

Dick Dadey served as first executive director from 1991\u20131997. ESPA has been the driving force in negotiating New York City's comprehensive domestic partnership law, passing a statewide hate crimes law, repealing a 150-year-old consensual sodomy statute, and enacting local non-discrimination laws and policies in Buffalo, Ithaca, Nassau County, and Westchester County. Each year, ESPA outlines legislative, electoral and organizing priorities for the state. In 2012, ESPA received press attention when, approaching the end of Ross D.

Mad Norwegian was founded by Lars Pearson, a former staffer at Wizard Magazine, and is based in Des Moines, Iowa. The majority of the company's output is reference guides to science-fiction series such as Doctor Who, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and The X-Files. As a rule of thumb, such guides examine the continuity that governs each show --- taking into consideration how different episodes reconcile against each other, for instance --- along with critiques, theorizing and behind-the-scenes details. The \"About Time\" series, a series of guidebooks to Doctor Who, deviates from this formula somewhat by examining the political and cultural context (as well as the development of television) that influenced Doctor Who on a year-by-year basis during its initial 26-year run (from 1963 to 1989). From 2002 to 2006, Mad Norwegian produced a series of Faction Paradox novels, using concepts and characters as created by Lawrence Miles. The company has a series of essay collections pertaining to women and fandom: the Hugo-Award-winning Chicks Dig Time Lords (2010), Whedonistas! (2011) and the Hugo-Award-nominated Chicks Dig Comics (2012), and the Hugo-Award-nominated Chicks Unravel Time (2012).

He was a well trained craftsman and woodworker. Within their first decade of manufacturing, Cunningham Piano Company had gained recognition and had become one of Philadelphia's most respected makers of pianos. Alfred Dolge, the author, industrialist, and respected piano man commented on Cunningham Piano Company, among others, \"...as true to the traditions of honest values in pianos as any the old Quaker City has ever produced.\" Throughout his tenure as president of the company, Patrick J. Cunningham saw his company expand and thrive, gaining awards for both quality and design. During the 1920s, the heyday of the pneumatic player piano, Cunningham Piano Company was the largest manufacturer of player pianos in Philadelphia and shipped their wares to the entire East Coast of the United States. Noted musicians praised the instruments, including Vincent Persichetti, a native Philadelphian and noted composer and professor at the Juilliard School, who said: \"In the beginning, God created a Cunningham player piano. I was two and played Verdi, Schumann, and Nevin piano rolls, hanging onto the music rack as I tried to reach the pedal mechanism with my feet.\" Also, one of America's greatest composers, George Gershwin, used a Cunningham Piano to write his opera \"Porgy and Bess\" in Folly Beach, South Carolina. That model of Cunningham was praised in Dorothea Benton Frank's book, Folly Beach: \"...Cunningham Piano Company, coincedentally also from Philadelphia, has been building pianos for symphonies, academies, and concert pianists since the 1890s and they were treasured by those who played them. Considering my rudimentary skill level, I was humbled to own one.\" However, The Great Depression was a huge detriment to all businesses and just before the beginning of World War II, Cunningham Piano Company ceased production and their staff focused on helping the war effort. After the Second World War, Louis Cohen, a young piano technician who had worked for Patrick J. Cunningham, took over and changed the face of Cunningham Piano Company. He saw that it was not a viable business model to continue building a small number of hand built pianos. He also saw that there was a growing specialty in this mature industry, that of piano rebuilding."

It was established in 1995 during the privatization of the Hungarian aluminium industry. MAL's initial assets were the Bakony bauxite mine, an alumina factory in Ajka and an aluminium smelter in Inota (municipality of V\u00e1rpalota), all of them in Veszpr\u00e9m County northwestern Hungary. The company set up subsidiaries in Germany and Romania, and acquired majority holdings in the SILKEM, producing zeolites and ground alumina in Kidri\u010devo, Slovenia, and Rudnici Boksita Jajce, which operates a high-grade bauxite mine near Jajce, central Bosnia. The smelting facilities at Inota were converted into a recycling operation in 2006, and sold off as INOTAL Aluminium Processing\u00a0Zrt. in 2007. On 4 October 2010, a retaining dam failed on one of the red mud ponds at the company's Ajka alumina factory, spilling 600,000\u2013700,000 cubic metres of highly alkaline and corrosive (caustic) red mud arising as a residual product from the treatment of bauxite with sodium hydroxide. At least ten people died, and about 150 people were injured, in the nearby settlements of Kolont\u00e1r and Devecser. On 13 October 2010, the government nationalized the company, the bill making this possible having been passed by the Parliament one day earlier. In 2013 the company went under liquidation. The production facilities were all sold to IC Profil Ltd. in 2015, so no production was undertaken by the company after that time. However, the company still owned the sludge storage facility (not in active use anymore due to the recent change in technology), and various buildings in its Ajka site. The company has completed the liquidation process in the late 2010s (exact year unknown), and in 2020 most of the activities of the successor companies moved from the Ajka site. As of October 2021, the website of MAL is shut down. As of December 2021, Silkem Hungary produces a subset of the earlier MAL products (specialty alumina and hydrates), and its website still lists the Ajka site as the production site."

He then turned to organizing tutoring programs for inner city youth in northeastern cities.  By 1963, NSM was reported to be helping as many as 3,500 children using 2,200 student volunteers from 50 colleges and universities.  NSM also encouraged direct-action protests, sending volunteers to sit-ins in the South and organizing rent strikes in the North.

The movement is mostly made up of ethnic Tuareg, some of whom are believed to have fought in the Libyan army during the 2011 Libyan Civil War (though other Tuareg MNLA fighters were on the side of the National Transitional Council and returned to Mali after that war). The movement was founded in October 2011 and had stated that it includes other Saharan peoples. The Malian government has accused the movement of having links to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The MNLA denies this claim. By 1 April 2012 the MNLA and Ansar Dine were in control of virtually all of northern Mali, including its three largest cities of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu. Tensions between the MNLA and Ansar Dine culminated in the Battle of Gao, in which the MNLA lost control of northern Malian cities to Ansar Dine and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa."

As the fifth state university in Ankara founded in 2010, AYBU is aware of its responsibilities and role as an educational leader and supporter of national and international economic development and advancement of education. One of the principle objectives of AYBU's Strategic Plan is to invest in broadening the scope and size of international collaborations by strengthening ties with existing global partners and building new partnerships with higher education institutions sharing AYBU's vision and mission for high quality research-based education in service of humanity. The other primary long-term objective of AYBU's internationalization strategy is Internationalization at Home. It aims at globalizing not only by receiving and sending students and academic staff abroad, but also by providing all AYBU students and staff with diverse, international and welcoming home campuses.

For that purpose, AYBU brings together global and local students, academic and administrative staff in formal and informal informative and consultative meetings to share experience and opportunities, discuss problems, recommend solutions and engage in productive conversations. To support teaching activities in foreign languages and the production of internationally acknowledged research, AYBU offers foreign language courses in English and Arabic to its academic staff. It does also provide numerous online cooperation opportunities such as joint programs, distance learning, shared digital resources, etc. that would contribute to the globally oriented educational experience. Furthermore, as part of the Internationalization at Home strategy, AYBU recognizes the importance of an accessible and rich university library. Therefore, the university actively invests in book donation activities and development of tools collecting, analysing and distributing data, which would have direct positive impact on students\u2019 and academic staff's studies and research. AYBU is confident to answer the fundamental principles and requirements of EU's Modernisation and Internationalisation Agenda for Higher Education. The university aims at educating internationally minded independent individuals that will answer national and international needs for high quality human capital.

Chief executive Stelio Tzonis said that use of the funding will be prioritized for building the API and advancing development of Urturn across multiple platforms, including Android. Marketed as a \"social platform for self-expression\", the site provided templates for users to customize media such as photos. The resulting content could then be shared over Urturn, as well as to Facebook and Twitter. Urturn goal at that time was to let developers create their own templates with the release of an API. Urturn headquarters were in London and had an office in Silicon Valley. It employed up to 25 staff. Urturn was more popular among teens and young adults and among females. The U.S., followed by the UK, and then South America accounted for most of the site's traffic. The service was also used by music brands such as One Direction. Urturn hoped these brands would be a source of revenue in addition to affiliate deals for music and other products. The social network development stopped in December 2014, followed by a complete shutdown of the platform early 2015."
