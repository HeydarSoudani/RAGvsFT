        "content": "The Atari Jaguar is a home video game console developed by Atari Corporation and  released in North America in November 1993. Part of the fifth generation of video game consoles, it competed with the 16-bit Sega Genesis and Super NES and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer that launched the same year. Despite its two custom 32-bit Tom and in addition to a Motorola 68000, Atari marketed it as the world's first 64-bit game system, emphasizing its 64-bit bus used by the blitter.  The Jaguar launched with Cybermorph as the pack-in game, which received divisive reviews. The system's library ultimately comprised only 50 licensed games. Development of the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s by Flare Technology, which focused on the system after cancellation of the Atari Panther console. The multi-chip architecture, hardware bugs, and poor tools made writing games for the Jaguar difficult. Underwhelming sales further eroded the console's third-party support. Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the system with the Atari Jaguar CD add-on, with an additional 13 games, and emphasizing the Jaguar's price of over  less than its competitors. With the release of the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall. It sold no more than 150,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996. The commercial failure of the Jaguar prompted Atari to leave the console market. After Hasbro Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation properties, the patents of the Jaguar were released into the public domain, with the console declared an open platform. Since its discontinuation, hobbyists have produced games for the system."

It was released by the Milton Bradley Company in November 1979 for a retail price of $49.99. The Microvision was designed by Jay Smith, the engineer who would later design the Vectrex gaming console. The Microvision's combination of portability and a cartridge-based system led to moderate success, with Smith Engineering grossing $15 million in the first year of the system's release. However, very few cartridges, a small screen, and a lack of support from established home video game companies led to its demise in 1981. According to Satoru Okada, the former head of Nintendo's R&D1 Department, the Microvision gave birth to the Game & Watch after Nintendo designed around Microvision's limitations."

Released in 1995, it was marketed as the first console capable of displaying  stereoscopic \"3D\" graphics. The player uses the console like a head-mounted display, placing the head against the eyepiece to see a red monochrome display. The games use a parallax effect to create the illusion of depth. Sales failed to meet targets, and Nintendo ceased distribution and game development in 1996, having released only 22 games for the system. Development of the Virtual Boy lasted four years and began under the project name VR32. Nintendo entered a licensing agreement to use a stereoscopic LED eyepiece technology which had been developed since the 1980s by US company Reflection Technology. It also built a factory in China to be used only for Virtual Boy manufacturing. Over the course of development, the console technology was downscaled due to high costs and potential health concerns, and an increasing amount of resources were reallocated to the development of the Nintendo 64, Nintendo's next home console. Lead game designer Shigeru Miyamoto had little involvement with the Virtual Boy software. The Virtual Boy was pushed to market in an unfinished state in 1995 to focus on the Nintendo 64. The Virtual Boy was panned by critics and was a commercial failure, even after repeated price drops. Its failure has been attributed to its high price, monochrome display, unimpressive stereoscopic effect, lack of true portability, and health concerns. Stereoscopic technology in video game consoles reemerged in later years to more success, including Nintendo's 3DS handheld console. , it is Nintendo's lowest-selling standalone console and the only to have less than 1 million units sold, seconded by the Wii U's 13.6 million units."

The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx, and NEC's TurboExpress. It shares much of its hardware with the Master System, and can play Master System games by the use of an adapter. Sega positioned the Game Gear, which had a full-color backlit screen with a landscape format, as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy. Though the Game Gear was rushed to market, its unique game library and price point gave it an edge over the Atari Lynx and TurboExpress. However, due to its short battery life, lack of original games, and weak support from Sega, the Game Gear was unable to surpass the Game Boy, selling 10.62 million units by March 1996. The Game Gear was discontinued on April 30, 1997. It was re-released as a budget system by Majesco Entertainment in 2000, under license from Sega. Reception of the Game Gear was mixed, with praise for its full-color backlit screen and processing power for its time, criticisms over its large size and short battery life, and questions over the quality of its game library. The Game Gear Micro, a retroconsole, was announced in June 2020 and released in October of the same year."

        "content": "The Douglas GAM-87 Skybolt (AGM-48 under the 1962 Tri-service system) was an air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) developed by the United States during the late 1950s. The basic concept was to allow US strategic bombers to launch their weapons from well outside the range of Soviet defenses, as much as  from their targets. To do this in an air-launched form, a lightweight thermonuclear warhead was needed. Initially, the W47 from the Polaris missile was selected, but it was later replaced by the W59 from the Minuteman missile. The UK joined the Skybolt program in 1960, intending to use it on their V bomber force. When the design added a star tracker in addition to its inertial navigation system (INS) this meant that it could only be carried externally where the tracker could see the sky. This requirement along with the required ground clearance on takeoff limited it to the Avro Vulcan bomber. A number of design decisions in the W47 led the RAF to question its safety, so they intended to use their own Red Snow warheads. This was a heavier warhead and would reduce the range to about , meaning the bombers would have to cross the Soviet coastline to attack Moscow. Testing began in 1962 and was initially marked by a string of failures. These failures, along with a lack of mission after the successful development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), led to its cancellation in December 1962. The UK had decided to base its entire 1960s deterrent force on Skybolt, and its cancellation led to a major disagreement between the UK and US, known today as the \"Skybolt Crisis\". This was resolved by a series of meetings that led to the Royal Navy gaining the UGM-27 Polaris missile and construction of the s to launch them."

        "content": "VAX is a series of computers featuring a 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) and virtual memory that was developed and sold by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the late 20th century. The VAX-11/780, introduced October 25, 1977, was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing the VAX ISA. The VAX family was a huge success for DEC - over 100 models were introduced over the lifetime of the design, with the last members arriving in the early 1990s. The VAX was succeeded by the DEC Alpha, which included several features from VAX machines to make porting from the VAX easier. VAX was designed as a successor to the 16-bit PDP-11, one of the most successful minicomputers in history with approximately 600,000 examples sold. The system was designed to offer backward compatibility with the PDP-11 while extending the memory to a full 32-bit implementation and adding demand paged virtual memory. The name VAX refers to its Virtual Address eXtension concept that allowed programs to make use of this newly available memory while still being compatible with unmodified user mode PDP-11 code. The name \"VAX-11\", used on early models, was chosen to highlight this capability. The VAX ISA is considered a complex instruction set computer (CISC) design. Later models in the series dropped the -11 branding as PDP-11 compatibility was no longer a major concern. The line expanded to both high-end machines like the VAX 9000 as well as to the workstation-scale systems like the VAXstation series. The VAX family ultimately contained ten distinct designs and over 100 individual models in total. All of these were compatible with each other and normally ran the VAX/VMS operating system. VAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA, with its very large number of assembly language programmer-friendly addressing modes and machine instructions, highly orthogonal instruction set architecture, and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion, number formatting, and polynomial evaluation."

The missile, powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine, was developed during the Second World War in Germany as a \"vengeance weapon\" and assigned to attack Allied cities as retaliation for the Allied bombings against German cities. The  rocket also became the first artificial object to travel into space by crossing the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line with the vertical launch of MW 18014 on 20 June 1944. Research into military use of long-range rockets began when the graduate studies of Wernher von Braun attracted the attention of the German Army. A series of prototypes culminated in the A-4, which went to war as the . Beginning in September 1944, over 3,000  were launched by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets, first London and later Antwerp and Li\u00e8ge. According to a 2011 BBC documentary, the attacks from  resulted in the deaths of an estimated 9,000 civilians and military personnel, and a further 12,000 forced laborers and concentration camp prisoners died as a result of their forced participation in the production of the weapons. The rockets travelled at supersonic speed, impacted without audible warning, and proved unstoppable, as no effective defense existed. Teams from the Allied forces\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union\u2014raced to seize key German manufacturing facilities, procure Germany's missile technology, and capture the V-2's launching sites. Von Braun and over 100 key  personnel surrendered to the Americans, and many of the original  team ended up working at the Redstone Arsenal. The US also captured enough  hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the  manufacturing facilities after the war, re-established  production, and moved it to the Soviet Union."

Designed by McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing) and Northrop (now part of Northrop Grumman), the F/A-18 was derived from the latter's YF-17 in the 1970s for use by the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and formerly, by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels. The F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform fighter escort, fleet air defense, suppression of enemy air defenses, air interdiction, close air support, and aerial reconnaissance. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset, though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its earlier contemporaries, such as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat in the fighter and strike fighter role, and the Grumman A-6 Intruder and LTV A-7 Corsair II in the attack role. The Hornet first saw combat action during the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and subsequently participated in the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 Iraq War. The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, its larger, evolutionary redesign."

The MiG-17 is still being used by the North Korean air force in the present day and has seen combat in the Middle East and Asia. The MiG-17 was an advanced modification of the MiG-15 aircraft produced by the Soviet Union during the Korean War. Production of the MiG-17 was too late for use in that conflict and was first used in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958. While the MiG-17 was designed to shoot down slower American bombers, it showed surprising success when used by North Vietnamese pilots to combat American fighters and fighter-bombers during the Vietnam War, nearly a decade after its initial design. This was due to the MiG-17 being more agile and maneuverable than the American F-4 Phantom and F-105 Thunderchief, which were focused on speed and long range combat."

All of the machines in the family are technically similar and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79\u00a0MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom coprocessor chips. This architecture enabled graphics and sound more advanced than contemporary machines, and gaming was a major draw. First-person space combat simulator Star Raiders is considered the platform's killer app. The systems launched with plug-and-play peripherals using the Atari SIO serial bus, an early analog of USB. The Atari 400 and 800 differ primarily in packaging. The 400 has a pressure-sensitive, spillproof membrane keyboard and initially shipped with 8 kB of RAM. The 800 has a conventional keyboard, a second (rarely used) cartridge slot, and slots that allow easy RAM upgrades to 48K. Both models were replaced by the  XL series in 1983, then\u2013after the company was sold and reestablished as Atari Corporation\u2013the XE models in 1985. The XL and XE are lighter in construction, have two joystick ports instead of four, and Atari BASIC is built-in. The 130XE has 128 KB of bank-switched RAM. Two million Atari 8-bit computers were sold during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985. They were sold through dedicated computer retailers and department stores, such as Sears, using an in-store demo to attract customers. The primary competition in the worldwide market came when the Commodore 64, with similar graphics performance, was introduced in 1982. In 1992, Atari Corporation officially dropped all remaining support for the 8-bit line. The \"Atari 8-bit family\" label was not contemporaneous. Atari, Inc., used the term \"Atari 800 [or 400] home computer system\", often combining the model names into \"Atari 400/800\" or simply \"Atari home computers\"."

As the result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems. The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Despite its protracted development and operational difficulties, USAF considers the F-22 a critical component of its tactical airpower. The fighter's combination of stealth, aerodynamic performance, and mission systems enable unprecedented air combat capabilities. The USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs. In 2009, the program was cut to 187 operational aircraft due to high costs, a lack of clear air-to-air missions during production, a ban on exports, and development of the more versatile F-35, with the last F-22 delivered in 2012."

Daimler-Benz took over manufacture of the Unimog in 1951, and first produced it in their Gaggenau plant. From 1951, the Unimog was sold under the Mercedes-Benz brand. However, the first Unimog to feature the three-pointed Mercedes-Benz star was only introduced in 1953. Since 2002, the Unimog has been built in the Mercedes-Benz truck plant in W\u00f6rth am Rhein in Germany. The Mercedes-Benz T\u00fcrk A.\u015e. plant assembles Unimogs in Aksaray, Turkey. Unimogs were also built in Argentina (first ever country to do so outside Germany) by Mercedes-Benz Argentina S.A. under licence from 1968 until 1983 (with some extra units built until 1991 off the assembly line from parts in stock) in the Gonz\u00e1lez Cat\u00e1n factory near the city of Buenos Aires. The first model was designed by Albert Friedrich and Heinrich R\u00f6\u00dfler shortly after World War II to be used in agriculture as a self-propelled machine providing a power take-off to operate saws in forests or harvesting machines on fields. It was designed with rear-wheel drive and switchable front-wheel drive, with equal-size wheels, in order to be driven on roads at higher speeds than standard farm tractors. With their very high ground clearance and a flexible frame that is essentially a part of the suspension, Unimogs are not designed to carry as much load as regular trucks. Due to their off-road capabilities, Unimogs can be found in jungles, mountains and deserts as military vehicles, fire fighters, expedition campers, and even in competitions like truck trials and Dakar Rally rally raids. In Western Europe, they are commonly used as snowploughs, municipal equipment carriers, agricultural implements, forest ranger vehicles, construction equipment or road\u2013rail vehicles and as army personnel or equipment carriers (in its armoured military version). New Unimogs can be purchased in one of two series: medium series 405, also known as the UGN (\"Ger\u00e4tetr\u00e4ger\" or equipment carrier), and heavy series 437, also known as the UHN (\"Hochgel\u00e4ndeg\u00e4ngig\" or highly mobile cross country)."

The Master System launched in North America in 1986, followed by Europe in 1987, and Brazil in 1989. A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987, which features a few enhancements over the export models (and by proxy the original Mark III): a built-in FM audio chip, a rapid-fire switch, and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses. The Master System II, a cheaper model, was released in 1990 in North America, Australasia and Europe. The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards. Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games. The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot, turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses. The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES, due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity. Though the Master System had newer, improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly greater success in other markets including Europe, Brazil, South Korea and Australia. The Sega Master System is estimated to have sold between 10 and 13 million units worldwide. In addition, Tectoy has sold  licensed Master System variants in Brazil.

She was one of two sister ships secretly ordered from the John Laird Sons & Company shipyard in 1862 by the Confederate States of America. Her true ownership was concealed by the fiction that she was being built as the Egyptian warship El Monassir. She was to have been named CSS Mississippi upon delivery to the Confederacy. Her sister was built under the false name El Tousson and was to have been renamed CSS North Carolina. In October 1863, a few months after their launch and before they could be completed, the UK Government seized the two ironclads. In 1864 the Admiralty bought them and commissioned them into the Royal Navy: El Monassir as HMS Wivern and El Tousson as . Wivern had a long Royal Navy career, until she was scrapped in Hong Kong in 1922."

Thirty-five of the class were built to haul express passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line route from London Kings Cross via York to Newcastle, and later via Newcastle to Edinburgh, Scotland. They remained in service on the East Coast Main Line until the early 1960s when they were replaced by Deltic diesel locomotives; they themselves proving to be worthy successors to the A4s. Several A4s saw out their remaining days until 1966 in Scotland, particularly on the Aberdeen \u2013 Glasgow express trains, for which they were used to improve the timing from 3.5 to 3 hours."

It is still in service with the Indian Air Force. Originally conceived in the 1960s as a jet trainer with a light ground attack capability, the requirement for the aircraft soon changed to include supersonic performance, reconnaissance and tactical nuclear strike roles. A carrier-based variant was also planned for French Navy service, but this was cancelled in favour of the cheaper Dassault-Breguet Super \u00c9tendard. The aircraft were manufactured by SEPECAT (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Production de l'avion Ecole de Combat et d'Appui Tactique), a joint venture between Breguet and the British Aircraft Corporation, one of the first major joint Anglo-French military aircraft programmes. The Jaguar was exported to India, Oman, Ecuador and Nigeria. The aircraft was used in numerous conflicts and military operations in Mauritania, Chad, Iraq, Bosnia, and Pakistan, as well as providing a ready nuclear delivery platform for the United Kingdom, France, and India throughout the latter half of the Cold War and beyond. In the Gulf War, the Jaguar was praised for its reliability and was a valuable coalition resource. The aircraft served with the French Air Force as the main strike/attack aircraft until 1 July 2005, and with the Royal Air Force until the end of April 2007. It was replaced by the Panavia Tornado and the Eurofighter Typhoon in the RAF and the Dassault Rafale in the French Air Force."

        "content": "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank introduced in 1940, famously deployed with the Red Army during World War II against Operation Barbarossa. Its 76.2\u00a0mm (3\u00a0in) tank gun was more powerful than its contemporaries while its 60 degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons. The Christie suspension was inherited from the design of American J. Walter Christie's M1928 tank, versions of which were sold turret-less to the Red Army and documented as \"farm tractors\", after being rejected by the U.S. Army. The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, and had a lasting impact on tank design. After the Germans encountered the tank in 1941, German general Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist called it \"the finest tank in the world\" and Heinz Guderian affirmed the T-34's \"vast superiority\" over German tanks. Alfred Jodl, chief of operations staff of the German armed forces noted in his war diary \"the surprise at this new and thus unknown wunder-armament being unleashed against the German assault divisions,\" although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war. The T-34 was the mainstay of Soviet armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34-85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined and rationalized to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht. Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/T-55 series). With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever. Its development led directly to the T-44, then the T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, that form the armoured core of many modern armies. T-34 variants were widely exported after World War II, and as recently as 2010 more than 130 were still in service."

Commissioned in 1916, Oklahoma served in World War I as a part of Battleship Division Six, protecting Allied convoys on their way across the Atlantic. After the war, she served in both the United States Battle Fleet and Scouting Fleet. Oklahoma was modernized between 1927 and 1929. In 1936, she rescued American citizens and refugees from the Spanish Civil War. On returning to the West Coast in August of the same year, Oklahoma spent the rest of her service in the Pacific. On 7 December 1941, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, several torpedoes from torpedo-bomber airplanes hit the Oklahoma'''s hull and the ship capsized. A total of 429 crew died; survivors jumped off the ship  into burning hot water or crawled across mooring lines that connected Oklahoma and . Some sailors inside escaped when rescuers drilled holes and opened hatches to rescue them. In 1943, Oklahoma was righted and salvaged. Unlike most of the other battleships that were recovered following Pearl Harbor, Oklahoma was too damaged to return to duty. Her wreck was eventually stripped of her remaining armament and superstructure before being sold for scrap in 1946. The hulk sank in a storm in 1947, while being towed from Oahu, Hawaii, to a breakers yard in San Francisco Bay. DesignOklahoma was the second of two s. Both were ordered in a naval appropriation act on 4 March 1911. She was the latest in a series of 22 battleships and seven armored cruisers ordered by the United States Navy between 1900 and 1911. The Nevada-class ships were the first of the US Navy's Standard-type battleships, of which 12 were completed by 1923. With these ships, the Navy created a fleet of modern battleships similar in long-range gunnery, speed, turning radius, and protection. Significant improvements, however, were made in the Standard type ships as naval technology progressed. The main innovations were triple turrets and all-or-nothing protection. The triple turrets reduced the length of the ship that needed protection by placing 10 guns in four turrets instead of five, thus allowing thicker armor. The Nevada-class ships were also the first US battleships with oil-fired instead of coal-fired boilers, oil having more recoverable energy per ton than coal, thus increasing the ships' range. Oklahoma differed from her sister  in being fitted with triple-expansion steam engines, a much older technology than Nevadas new geared turbines. As constructed, she had a standard displacement of  and a full-load displacement of . She was  in length overall,  at the waterline, and had a beam of  and a draft of . She was powered by 12 oil-fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers driving two dual-acting, vertical triple-expansion steam engines, which provided  for a maximum speed of . She had a designed range of  at . As built, the armor on Oklahoma consisted of belt armor from  thick. Deck armor was  thick with a second  deck, and turret armor was  or  on the face,  on the top,  on the sides, and  on the rear. Armor on her barbettes was 13.5\u00a0inches. Her conning tower was protected by 16\u00a0inches of armor, with 8\u00a0inches of armor on its roof. Her armament consisted of ten /45 caliber guns, arranged in two triple and two twin mounts. As built, she also carried 21 /51 caliber guns, primarily for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. She also had two (some references say four)  torpedo tubes for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo. Her crew consisted of 864 officers and enlisted men."

Gneisenau initially served with the German fleet in I Scouting Group, though her service there was limited owing to the British development of the battlecruiser by 1909, which the less powerful armored cruisers could not effectively combat. Accordingly, Gneisenau was assigned to the German East Asia Squadron, where she joined her sister ship . The two cruisers formed the core of the squadron, which included several light cruisers. Over the next four years, Gneisenau patrolled Germany's colonial possessions in Asia and the Pacific Ocean. She also toured foreign ports to show the flag and monitored events in China during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, crossed the Pacific to the western coast of South America, stopping for Gneisenau and Scharnhorst to attack French Polynesia in the Bombardment of Papeete in September. After arriving off the coast of Chile, the East Asia Squadron encountered and defeated a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel; during the action, Gneisenau disabled the British armored cruiser , which was then sunk by the German light cruiser . The defeat prompted the British Admiralty to detach two battlecruisers to hunt down and destroy Spee's squadron, which they accomplished at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914. Gneisenau was sunk with heavy loss of life, though 187 of her crew were rescued by the British."

The first American battleships designed after the Washington treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s, they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing the main battery to  guns, but refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of . A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried, combined with the displacement restriction, resulted in cramped ships, a problem that was exacerbated as wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries significantly increased their crews. Indiana entered service in April 1942, by which time the United States was engaged in World War II, and the ship was immediately pressed into action in the Pacific War against Japan. Her first combat came in late 1942 when she supported marines fighting during the Guadalcanal campaign. Over the next three years, she was occupied with two primary roles: naval gunfire support for amphibious assaults across the Pacific and anti-aircraft defense for the fast carrier task force. She shelled Japanese positions during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943 and the Battle of Kwajalein in February 1944. During the latter operation, she collided with the battleship  and was forced to withdraw for repairs. After returning to the fleet in April 1944, she took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, bombarding Saipan and helping to defend the fleet during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Engine problems prevented her from participating in the Battle of Peleliu in September, but she was present for the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. In the latter action, she shot down a number of kamikazes. Following the Japanese surrender in August, she contributed men to the occupation force before returning to the United States in September. After a final refit, she was placed in reserve and remained inactive in the Navy's inventory until 1962 when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap the following year."

It is the standard issue infantry weapon of the Finnish Defence Forces. The RK 62 was designed in 1962 and is based on the Polish licensed version of the Soviet AK-47 design. The RK 62 uses the same 7.62\u00d739mm cartridge as the AK-47. Between 1965 and 1994 350,000 M62 rifles were produced jointly by Valmet and Sako. It is the basis of the IMI Galil, an Israeli-made assault rifle with many similarities. The RK 62 has a three-pronged flash suppressor, and a groove for a specially designed knife bayonet, which can be used alone as a combat knife. The RK 95 TP is a more modern, improved version of the RK 62. One of the most distinctive features of the Valmet rifles, including the M62 and all subsequent variations, is the open-ended, three prong flash suppressor with a bayonet lug on its lower side. In addition to the flash suppression, the end can quickly cut barbed wire by pushing the muzzle onto a strand of wire and firing a round."

        "content": "The Saab 93 (pronounced ninety-three) is the second production automobile that was manufactured by Saab. Styled by Sixten Sason, it was first presented on December 1, 1955. The 93 was powered by a longitudinally-mounted three-cylinder 748\u00a0cc Saab two-stroke engine giving 33\u00a0hp (25\u00a0kW). The gearbox had three gears, the first unsynchronised. In order to overcome the problems of oil starvation on overrun (engine braking) for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. In 1957, two-point seatbelts were introduced as an option. The 93 was the first Saab to be exported from Sweden, with most exports going to the United States. A Saxomat clutch and a cabrio coach (large cloth sunroof) were available as options. On September 2, 1957 the 93B was introduced. The original two-piece windshield was also replaced with a one-piece windshield. In 1957, Erik Carlsson finished 1st in the Finland Rally in a Saab 93, in 1959 he was 1st in the Swedish Rally, also in a Saab 93. However, Saab was not the first Swedish manufacturer to win the Swedish Rally. Saab's long-standing Swedish rival Volvo had beaten them consecutively in 1957 and 1958 with the PV544. In late 1959 the 93F was introduced, featuring front-hinged doors from the Saab GT750. 1960 was the last year of production for the 93. The 93 was replaced by the Saab 96, although the two models were sold side by side for the earlier part of the year. A total of 52,731 Saab 93s were made. Saab Sonett I shared many of its components with the 93."

        "content": "The  Vickers VC10 is a mid-sized, narrow-body long-range British jet airliner designed and built by Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd and first flown at Brooklands, Surrey, in 1962. The airliner was designed to operate on long-distance routes from the shorter runways of the era and commanded excellent hot and high performance for operations from African airports. The performance of the VC10 was such that it achieved the fastest crossing of the Atlantic by a subsonic jet airliner of 5 hours and 1 minute, a record that was held for 41 years, until February 2020 when a British Airways Boeing 747 broke the record at 4 hours 56 minutes due to Storm Ciara. Only the supersonic Concorde was faster. The VC10 is often compared to the larger Soviet Ilyushin Il-62, the two types being the only airliners to use a rear-engined quad layout. The smaller business jet Lockheed JetStar also has this engine arrangement. Although only a relatively small number of VC10s were built, they provided long service with BOAC and other airlines from the 1960s to 1981. They were also used from 1965 as strategic air transports for the Royal Air Force, and ex-passenger models and others were used as aerial refuelling aircraft. The 50th anniversary of the first flight of the prototype VC10, G-ARTA, was celebrated with a \"VC10 Retrospective\" Symposium and the official opening of a VC10 exhibition at Brooklands Museum on 29 June 2012. The type was retired from RAF service on 20 September 2013. It has been succeeded in the aerial refuelling role by the Airbus Voyager. VC10 K.3 ZA147 performed the final flight of the type on 25 September 2013."

The twin-turbocharged 959 was the world's fastest street-legal production car when introduced, achieving a top speed of , with some variants even capable of achieving . During its production run, the 959 was considered as the most technologically advanced road-going sports car ever built, and forerunner of all forthcoming sports cars. After the successful introduction of all-wheel drive on more rally-specific cars like the Audi Quattro, it was one of the first pure high-performance sports-cars with all-wheel drive, providing the basis for Porsche's first all-wheel drive 911 Carrera 4 model. Its performance convinced Porsche executives to make all-wheel drive standard on all turbocharged versions of the 911 starting with the 993. The twin-turbo system used on the 959 also made its way to future turbocharged Porsche sports cars. In 2004, Sports Car International named the 959 number one on its list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s."

        "content": "The Ford Laser is a compact car, originally a subcompact car in the first three generations, which was sold by Ford in Asia, Oceania, and parts of South America and Africa. It has generally been available as a sedan or hatchback, although convertible, wagon and pick-up versions have also been available in different markets. The sedan, and briefly station wagon, versions were badged Ford Meteor in Australia between 1981 and 1987. The Ford Meteor name was also used in South Africa. The Ford Laser was a restyled version of the Familia/323 models produced by Mazda in Japan from 1980 onwards. Ford had acquired a 25% stake in Mazda in 1979. Platform and assembly-line sharing with the locally produced Mazda Familia in Japan allowed the Laser in that market to be offered with a plethora of engine, paint and trim configurations not available anywhere else in the world. This was most notably evident during the 1980s with multiple turbocharged variants, unique bodyshells such as the cabriolet, and full-time 4WD models all available years before their debuts in other markets (and in some cases, never making it offshore at all). Along with the Japanese produced Ford Telstar and Ford Festiva, the Laser was sold at special Autorama dealerships. In Australia and New Zealand, where Ford was seen as a local brand, the locally assembled Laser outsold its Mazda twin, the 323, especially in Australia, where the 323 was imported. According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323. However, in neighbouring Asian markets, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, as well as Japan itself, the reverse was the case, although pooling resources with Mazda allowed Ford to maintain a foothold in the region. This was also the case in South America, South Africa, and the Caribbean, where the Laser was also sold, in many cases being locally assembled."

It was the third and final V bomber to be operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), the other two being the Avro Vulcan and the Vickers Valiant. Entering service in 1958, the Victor was initially developed as part of the United Kingdom's airborne nuclear deterrent, but it was retired from the nuclear mission in 1968, following the discovery of fatigue cracks which had been exacerbated by the RAF's adoption of a low-altitude flight profile to avoid interception, and due to the pending introduction of the Royal Navy's submarine-launched Polaris missiles in 1969. With the nuclear deterrent mission relinquished to the Royal Navy a large V-bomber fleet could not be justified. A number of Victors were modified for strategic reconnaissance, using a combination of radar, cameras, and other sensors.  Prior to the introduction of Polaris, some had already been converted into tankers to replace Valiants; further conversions to tankers followed and some of these re-purposed Victors refuelled Vulcan bombers during the Black Buck raids of the Falklands War. Due to its technological sophistication and superior capabilities, the Victor was the last of the V-bombers to be retired from service on 15 October 1993, following the earlier retirement of the Valiants in 1965 and Vulcans in 1984. In its refueling role the Victor was replaced by the Vickers VC10 and the Lockheed Tristar."

The original concept was conceived by Gordon Murray. Murray was able to convince Ron Dennis to back the project. He engaged Peter Stevens to design the exterior and interior of the car. On 31 March 1998, the XP5 prototype with a modified rev limiter set the Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production car, reaching , surpassing the modified Jaguar XJ220's  record from 1993. The car features numerous proprietary designs and technologies; it is lighter and has a more streamlined structure than many modern sports cars, despite having one seat more than most similar sports cars, with the driver's seat located in the centre (and slightly forward) of two passengers' seating positions, providing driver visibility superior to that of a conventional seating layout. It was conceived as an exercise in creating what its designers hoped would be considered the ultimate road car. Despite not having been designed as a track machine, a modified race car edition of the vehicle won several races, including the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, where it faced purpose-built prototype race cars. Production began in 1992 and ended in 1998. In all, 106 cars were manufactured, with some variations in the design. In 1994, the British car magazine Autocar stated in a road test regarding the F1, \"The McLaren F1 is the finest driving machine yet built for the public road.\" They further stated, \"The F1 will be remembered as one of the great events in the history of the car, and it may possibly be the fastest production road car the world will ever see.\" In 2005, Channel4 placed the car at number one on their list of the 100 greatest cars, calling it \"the greatest automotive achievement of all time\". In popular culture, the McLaren F1 has earned its spot as 'The greatest automobile ever created' and 'The Most Excellent Sports Car of All Time' amongst a wide variety of car enthusiasts and lovers. Notable past and present McLaren F1 owners include Elon Musk, Rowan Atkinson, Jay Leno, George Harrison, Ralph Lauren, Nick Mason, and the Sultan of Brunei. In the April 2017 issue of Top Gear Magazine, the McLaren F1 was listed as one of the fastest naturally aspirated cars currently available in the world, and in the same league as the more modern vehicles such as the Ferrari Enzo and Aston Martin One-77 despite being produced and engineered 10 years prior to the Ferrari Enzo and 17 years prior to the Aston Martin One-77."

Developed from a specification issued by the French Air Ministry during 1930, the D.500 was developed to be a more capable replacement to the Nieuport 62. Ordered by the French Air Force during November 1933 and introduced in its initial model during 1935, the design was developed into several variants, most notably the D.510, which was re-engined with the more powerful Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs powerplant. It proved to be a relatively popular aircraft during the Interwar period; in France, in addition to the French Air Force's units, a specialised model of the type, the D.501, was also procured by the French Naval Aviation for carrier operations. Beyond its use in France, the D.500 saw several export sales and evaluations by prospective major customers including the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. The D.500/D.501 saw combat with several operators. During the Spanish Civil War, it was surreptitiously supplied to the Spanish Republican Air Force; it was also flown by the Republic of China Air Force against the invading Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the late 1930s, the type was largely superseded by a new generation of French fighter aircraft, these typically featured further innovations such as enclosed cockpits and retractable undercarriages, and included the design's direct successor, the Dewoitine D.520. Despite being largely obsolete, both D.500s and D.510s were operated by the French Air Force during the initial months of the Second World War, the latter remaining in use up to the end of the Battle of France and signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 between France and Nazi Germany."

The Ibiza is named after the Spanish island of Ibiza and was the second SEAT model to be named after a Spanish location, after the SEAT M\u00e1laga. It was introduced at the 1984 Paris Motor Show as the first car developed by SEAT as an independent company, although it was designed by SEAT in collaboration with well-known firms including Italdesign, Karmann, and Porsche. From the second-generation version onwards, SEAT formed part of the German automotive industry concern Volkswagen Group. All subsequent Ibiza generations, and the rest of the SEAT model range, incorporated Volkswagen Group platforms, parts, and technologies. The Ibiza spans five generations, among which it has debuted twice (in its second and in its fourth generations) a new platform of the Volkswagen Group. All of them were the top-selling model in SEAT's product line. The Ibiza is now available only in five-door hatchback variants; between 1993 and 2008, saloon, coup\u00e9, and estate versions were sold as the SEAT C\u00f3rdoba. In 2010, an estate version, called Ibiza ST, was launched."

The G.91 has its origins in the NATO-organised NBMR-1 competition in 1953, which sought a light fighter-bomber (officially, the competition was seeking a \"Light Weight Strike Fighter\") to be adopted as standard equipment across the air forces of the various NATO nations. After reviewing multiple submissions, the G.91 was picked as the winning design of the NBMR-1 competition. The G.91 entered into operational service with the Italian Air Force in 1961, and with the West German Luftwaffe in the following year. Various other nations adopted it, such as the Portuguese Air Force, who made extensive use of the type during the Portuguese Colonial War in Angola and Mozambique. The G.91 enjoyed a long service life that extended over 35 years. The G.91 remained in production for 19 years, during which a total of 756 aircraft were completed, including the prototypes and pre-production models. The assembly lines were finally closed in 1977. The G.91 was also used as a basis for a twin-engined development: the Fiat/Aeritalia G.91Y."

The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for Edsel Ford, who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was given European \"continental\" styling elements, including a rear-mounted spare tire. In production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line.  The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental.  After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS. As part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the personal luxury car.  Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than sports cars and grand touring cars with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956\u20131957 Continental Mark II as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the Continental Mark series in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998. Along with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo downsizing (for the 1980 model year). Production of the Continental and MKZ, its only two sedans, ended in 2020 thereby making Lincoln a crossover/SUV-only brand."

Different models of the Zaporozhets, all of which had an air-cooled engine in the rear, were produced until 1994. Since the late 1980s, the final series, 968M, was replaced by the cardinally different ZAZ-1102 Tavria hatchback, which featured a front-wheel drive and a more powerful water-cooled engine. The name Zaporozhets translates into a Cossack of the Zaporizhian Sich or \u0430 man from Zaporizhzhia or the Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Zaporozhets is still well known in many former Soviet states. Like the Volkswagen Beetle or East Germany's Trabant, the Zaporozhets was destined to become a \"people's car\" of the Soviet Union, and as such it was the most affordable vehicle of its era. At the same time, it was rather sturdy and known for its excellent performance on poor roads. Another important advantage of the Zaporozhets was its ease of repair. The car's appearance gave birth to several nicknames that became well known across the Soviet Union: horbatyi (\"hunchback\", owing to ZAZ-965's insect-like form; although ZAZ factory workers never used this nickname), malysh (), ushastyi (\"big-eared\", due to 966 and 968's round air intakes on each side of the car to cool the rear-mounted engine), zapor (\"constipation\"), mylnitsa (\"soap-box\", for ZAZ-968M, lacking \"ears\" and producing a more box-like appearance). Numerous special versions of the Zaporozhets were produced, equipped with additional sets of controls that allowed operating the car with a limited set of limbs, and were given for free or with considerable discounts to disabled people, especially war veterans - similar to SMZ-series microcars. These mobility cars would at times take up to 25% of ZAZ factory output."

        "content": "The Toyota Camry (; Japanese: \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30fb\u30ab\u30e0\u30ea Toyota Kamuri) is an automobile sold internationally by the Japanese manufacturer Toyota since 1982, spanning multiple generations. Originally compact in size (narrow-body), the Camry has grown since the 1990s to fit the mid-size classification (wide-body)\u2014although the two widths co-existed in that decade. Since the release of the wide-bodied versions, Camry has been extolled by Toyota as the firm's second \"world car\" after the Corolla. In Japan, Camry was once exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store retail dealerships. Narrow-body cars also spawned a rebadged sibling in Japan, the Toyota Vista (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30fb\u30d3\u30b9\u30bf)\u2014also introduced in 1982 and sold at Toyota Vista Store locations. Diesel fuel versions have previously retailed at Toyota Diesel Store. The Vista Ardeo was a wagon version of the Vista V50. Between 1979 and 1982, the Camry nameplate was delegated to a four-door sedan model in Japan, known as the Celica Camry. When Camry became an independent model line in 1982 with the V10 series, Toyota made it available as a five-door liftback in addition to the sedan. The subsequent Camry V20 series, debuted in 1986 with a station wagon substituting the liftback body variant and Japan-only hardtop sedans making their debut. The company replaced the V20 in 1990 with the V30 sedan and hardtop, but this model series was exclusive to Japan. Automotive tax regulations in that country dictated the retention of a narrower body as used in previous Camry generations. However, overseas demand for a larger Camry resulted in the development of a wide-body XV10 sedan and station wagon that arrived in 1991. Japan also received the wider XV10 as the Toyota Scepter (\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30fb\u30bb\u30d7\u30bf\u30fc). The company then issued an XV10-bodied coup\u00e9 in 1993 that was spun off in 1998 as an independent model line, titled Camry Solara. When the Japanese market received a new narrow-body V40 series in 1994 to replace V30, the wide-body XV10 continued unchanged. Its replacement, the XV20, arrived in 1996\u2014named Camry Gracia in Japan. It was not until the narrow V40 ended manufacture in 1998 that the Camry in Japan was to again mirror the cars sold internationally. Japanese sedans dropped the Gracia suffix in 1999, although it was retained by the wagon until its 2001 demise. From 1998, the Vista ended its Camry alignment, and instead branched into an independent model line with the V50 series for an extra generation before the nameplate was withdrawn in 2003. The next wide-body model, the XV30, came in 2001. Now sold only as a sedan, it now offered two different front- and rear-end design treatments. Japan and most global markets received one style; a separate, more conservative version covered markets in East and Southeast Asia. With the XV40 of 2006, the Camry-derived Aurion become the donor model for the more conservative Camry sold in this region. The subsequent XV50 series, sold from 2011 until 2019, has resulted in even more markets adopting the alternative body panels, such as Japan and Eastern Europe. The current generation is called the XV70. When Toyota launched their luxury Lexus brand in 1989, it offered a close derivative of the Camry/Vista hardtop sedan as the Lexus ES. The relationship continues to this day, but over the generations, the ES\u2014sold as the Toyota Windom in Japan from 1991 through to 2005\u2014gravitated further away from its Camry brethren. Between 2000 and 2010 and since 2012, Daihatsu has offered a badge engineered Camry as the Daihatsu Altis (\u30c0\u30a4\u30cf\u30c4\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9) sold only in Japan. Badge engineering has also occurred in Australia with the Holden Apollo between 1989 and 1996. From 1993, Toyota Australia badged V6-engined versions as Camry Vienta, becoming Toyota Vienta in 1995 until the badge's departure in 2000. Between 2006 and 2017, the Toyota Aurion model from Australia was derived from the V6 Camry, but with revised front-end and rear-end styling treatment and a partially refurbished cabin."

The Starfire nameplate made its debut with the 1954\u20131956 Ninety-Eight series convertibles. For 1957 only, all Ninety-Eight series models were named \"Starfire 98\". Oldsmobile during this time period was one of the most popular brands selling, and the company saw an opportunity to benefit from the Space Race of the 1960s. The \"rocket\" terminology was already a benefit with their Rocket V8. After a two-year hiatus the Starfire name returned for 1961 as separate model offered in a single convertible body style. Intended to compete in the growing personal luxury car market, from 1961 to 1965 the Starfire Convertible was the highest-priced model offered by Oldsmobile. While it shared most of its sheet metal with other full-sized Oldsmobile models, the Starfire wore unique trim and luxurious interiors. The Starfire Coupe hardtop joined the convertible for the 1962 model year. For the final 1966 model year, the convertible was dropped and the Starfire was moved downmarket to make room for the all-new Oldsmobile Toronado. After a nine-year break, the Starfire nameplate returned for the 1975 model year as Oldsmobile's first subcompact, powered by a Buick V6 engine. The 1977 Starfire featured a four-cylinder engine as standard equipment, a return to an Oldsmobile branded vehicle to use a four cylinder engine since 1922 with the Oldsmobile Model 43 sedan, with a V6 and V8 optional. Production ceased in 1980."

This situation lasted into the early 1990s. GMC first rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the 'Yukon' in 1991. Chevrolet however waited until 1994, when they rebadged the redesigned mid-size S-10 Blazer as their 'new Blazer', while renaming the full-size Blazer as the 'Tahoe'. The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding Lake Tahoe in the western United States. The name Yukon refers to the Yukon territory of northern Canada. For the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new, longer 4-door model, slotting in size between the 2-door models and the longer wheelbase Chevrolet/GMC Suburbans. The Tahoe is sold in North America, parts of Asia such as the Philippines and the Middle East, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Angola as a left-hand drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East. The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon currently serve as a part of General Motors' full-size SUV family and are differentiated from similar models the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL primarily by the length of the passenger and cargo area behind the C pillar. An upscale trim Denali sub-model joined the Yukon lineup for the 1999 model year and the Cadillac Escalade is a closely related upscale version sharing the same platform. The Tahoe's main competition comes from the Ford Expedition, but it also competes with the Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada.

Sales of the Five-seveN were originally restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers, but since 2004, the pistol has also been offered to civilian shooters for personal protection, target shooting, and similar uses. Although offered only with sporting ammunition, the Five-seveN's introduction to civilian shooters was met with vocal opposition from gun control organizations such as the Brady Campaign, and the pistol has been subject to ongoing controversy in the United States.

At the time of its first flight on 30 September 1986, it was designated the L-39MS. Aero no longer produces this aircraft. In 1992, a dedicated single-seat attack variant was proposed under the project name ALCA (Advanced Light Combat Aircraft), and was successfully marketed to the Czech Air Force. First flight of this variant, designated L-159A, was on 2 August 1997. The aircraft features mostly Western avionics, with systems integration undertaken by Boeing. Since then a new two-seat trainer has been flown as the L-159B Albatros II."

The name is recycled from the Dodge Raider SUV sold from 1987 to 1990, which was a rebadged Mitsubishi Montero. The Raider filled the gap in the Mitsubishi lineup since the discontinuation of the Mighty Max in 1996. Though Mitsubishi was still building their own Triton at the time, it would have been subject to the chicken tax, while an American-built pickup was not. Chrysler manufactured the Raider alongside the Dakota at their Warren Truck Assembly plant in Warren, Michigan, but they were sent to Normal, Illinois, for installation of some Mitsubishi-specific parts and for distribution. Engine choices had included a 4.7\u00a0L PowerTech V8 making  and  and a 3.7\u00a0L PowerTech V6 which produced  and , though by the 2008 model year, only the 3.7\u00a0L V6 was available.

Just like the Persona is based on the 1987-1991 Mazda Capella, the MS-8 is based on the 1991-1997 Mazda Cronos (Capella sedan). The MS-8 had the same dimensions as the Cronos, and the \u025b\u0303fini MS-6, sharing the 2.5 L V6 engine. The width, length, and engine displacement dimensions have particular significance in Japan, due to dimension regulations, where Japanese consumers pay an additional annual tax for larger vehicles, and obligate them to pay more annual road tax. The MS-8 is a hardtop-style sedan in the vein of the Toyota Cresta, Nissan Laurel, Honda Vigor, and Mitsubishi Emeraude. Unlike the Cresta  or the previous Persona, however, the MS-8's body has a B-pillar that is much thicker below the beltline than it is above. Doing so allows the bodyshell more rigidity while still maintaining an airy cabin.  Such a B-pillar means that the front seatbelts must be installed below the beltline. The front passenger seat belt tensioner unit, where the seat belt would recoil for storage when not in use, was located inside the rear passenger doors, and the seat belt latch was located on the front headrest support arm, allowing the belt to be properly positioned when the headrest was adjusted for height for the front passenger. The MS-8's interior design has several unique features. The car is only fitted with a 4-speed automatic gearbox, and the gear shifter is mounted on the dashboard next to the air-conditioning controls. Doing so eliminates the floor console between the front seats, and allows for a split front bench seat. The display for climate control and factory-equipped audio is located atop the dashboard, in a thin slit right before the windshield defroster. The sunroof is very large for its day, extending all the way above the rear seat footwell. Following the 1991 \u025b\u0303fini RX-7, the MS-8 is also available with the Bose Acoustic Wave Guide audio system, a compact subwoofer design. The stereo and CD player were concealed behind a retractable cover in the center of the dashboard below the air conditioning controls, however, simple functions like the volume, music source (radio or CD player) and music selection controls were installed remotely on the steering wheel. Four-wheel steering is an extra-cost option. Like the system on the Mazda Sentia, it is designed to minimize turn radius at town speeds, and improve stability at highway speed. Production for the MS-8 ceased when Mazda's multi-brand strategy failed in Japan, and the company suffered financial difficulties."

The naming is formally determined by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). The 193\u00a0nm wavelength was introduced by many (but not all) companies for lithography of critical layers mainly during the 90\u00a0nm node. Yield issues associated with this transition (due to the use of new photoresists) were reflected in the high costs associated with this transition. Even more significantly, the 300\u00a0mm wafer size became mainstream at the 90\u00a0nm node. The previous wafer size was 200\u00a0mm diameter."

It was used alongside the panokseon warships in the fight against invading Japanese naval ships. The ship's name derives from its protective shell-like covering. One of a number of pre-industrial armoured ships developed in Europe and in East Asia, this design has been described by some as the first armored ship in the world. The first references to older, first-generation turtle ships, known as gwiseon (\uadc0\uc120; \u9f9c\u8239, ), come from 1413 and 1415 records in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, which mention a mock battle between a gwiseon and a Japanese warship. However, these early turtle ships soon fell out of use as Korea's naval preparedness decreased during a long period of relative peace. Turtle ships participated in the war against Japanese naval forces supporting Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attempts to conquer Korea from 1592 to 1598. Korean Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who won all battles against the Japanese Navy, is credited with designing the improved turtle ship. From their first appearance in the Battle of Sacheon, his turtle ships, equipped with at least five different types of cannon, greatly contributed to winning 16 times in 16 battles against the Japanese Navy until they were destroyed, under the command of Won Gyun, in the Battle of Chilcheollyang.  Their most distinguishable feature was a dragon-shaped head at the bow (front) that could launch cannon fire or flames from the mouth. Each was also equipped with a fully covered deck to protect against arrow fire, musket-shots, and incendiary weapons. The deck was covered with iron spikes to discourage the enemy from attempting to board the ship."

When built in 1907, they were the largest steam locomotives in the world as the locomotive itself weighed 410,000 pounds (260 tons). The L-1 Class was also called the \"Angus\" Type in homage to Angus Sinclair, who was the publisher of Railway & Locomotive Engineering, a leading trade journal. A rarely seen photograph of #2602 shows his name under the windows on the cab sides. The use of an intercepting valve allowed the locomotive to be used in simple or single expansion steam capacity. This meant if desired, high pressure steam could be supplied to the front AND rear cylinder groups for additional power, but at the cost of exhausting the boiler of steam pressure quicker. These locomotives were built for \"pusher\" service, especially on the heavy grades of the Erie Railroads' Susquehanna Division over Gulf Summit on the Pennsylvania and New York State border; and these locomotives primarily operated between Port Jervis, NY and Susquehanna, PA. Pusher service is defined where additional locomotives are/were added to the rear of a train, of which has its normal compliment of locomotives on the lead end. The pusher locomotives then assist by helping push the train up the grade. Also, they helped control the stresses on the couplers and draft gear, and by which lowered the amount of broken coupler knuckles on a heavy train. In the modern diesel electric locomotive era, this pusher service could be compared to Distributed Power Units or DPU's. (However DPU's are unmanned and electronically controlled by the lead locomotive.) Steam powered pusher locomotives were obviously manned, as the electronic technology did not exist in the early 1900s. Even diesel electric locomotives assigned to pusher service throughout the 1960s and 1970s were manned, as the technology was just budding for efficient unmanned and remote of locomotives."

The second-generation of Tiida (C12) is marketed since 2011 and only available as a five-door hatchback, while the role of a four-door sedan was passed to the subcompact N17 series and the compact Sylphy/Sentra/Pulsar (B17). Starting in 2013, the C12 Tiida was released in Thailand, Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar. The C12 Tiida represents a departure from the C11, increasing its width to comfortably occupy the compact class, and was no longer marketed in Japan. It is currently produced and marketed in Taiwan. The third-generation Tiida sold in Russia and China was introduced in 2015 as a rebadged Pulsar (C13) hatchback."

Designed to combine a mixture of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) Group C regulations with the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) GTP regulations, the 787s were the last Wankel rotary-powered racing cars to compete in the World and Japanese championships, using Mazda's R26B engine. Although the 787 and 787B lacked the single lap pace of World Championship competitors such as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and Porsche, as well as Japanese Championship competitors Nissan and Toyota, the 787s had reliability that allowed them to contend for their respective championships. The reliability of the cars eventually paid off in 1991 when a 787B driven by Johnny Herbert, Volker Weidler, and Bertrand Gachot went on to victory in the 1991 24 Hours of Le Mans. As of 2021, this remains the only victory by a car not using a reciprocating engine design. It was the first victory by a Japanese manufacturer, and the only such victory until Toyota won the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans. A total of two 787s were built in 1990, while three newer specification 787Bs were built in 1991."

Superseding the HT-C truck, a new bolsterless radial HTCR truck was fitted to all EMD SD70s built 1992\u20132002; in 2003 the non-radial HTSC truck (basically the HTCR made less costly by removing radial components) was made standard on the SD70ACe and SD70M-2 models; the radial HTCR truck remained available as an option. All SD70ACe and SD70M-2 locomotives are, from the factory, equipped with one Nathan Airchime K5LLA-R1L airhorn mounted on a high-profile base. Due to height clearance restrictions, production models of the SD70ACe-T4 will be equipped with one K5LLA airhorn, mounted on a low-profile base, facing forward, and one \"dual tone\" K-13B airhorn, mounted over the rear headlight, facing rearward."

It was not intended to reconnoitre and report as its name suggests but was a light armoured combat vehicle, mostly without a radio and used as a support tank for the mechanised infantry. The AMR 35 originated from a project in 1933 to improve the earlier AMR 33 by moving the engine from the front to the back. In 1934 also a stronger suspension was fitted and the type was chosen to replace the AMR 33 on the production lines that year. Three orders were made by the French Cavalry of in total two hundred vehicles in five versions, including two machine-gun tanks, two tank destroyer types and a command tank. Later ten were ordered of a radio communication variant, the Renault YS, and over forty were built of a tropical version, the ZT 4. The production would be much delayed by financial and technical problems, deliveries only starting in 1936. The AMR 35 proved to be an unreliable vehicle. It was one of the fastest tanks of its day, but its very speed overstressed its mechanical parts. In 1937 it was decided not to make any further orders but organisational difficulties slowed final deliveries of some versions until well into 1940; even by the time of the Fall of France in June 1940 the ZT 4 order had not yet been finished. During the Battle of France the AMR 35s were part of armoured and motorised divisions, the vast majority being lost during the first weeks of the fighting. During the remainder of the Second World War Germany made use of some captured vehicles."

The Ruvi was considerably smaller than any other camcorder available at the time, at 124 mm \u00d7 66 mm \u00d7 44.1\u00a0mm and 380 g. This made the Ruvi small enough to keep inside a shirt pocket. Ruvi is an abbreviation of Recording Unit by Video. The small size was achieved by making the tape essentially non-removable. A miniature \"video cartridge\" contained thirty minutes of Hi8 tape permanently loaded around a conventional helical scan record head. The head itself was part of the cartridge, negating the need for a loading mechanism. Although user-replaceable, the cartridge was intended to be a service part and not a form of removable media. The Ruvi contained several features that were considered innovative at the time of its release. The camera had high-density electronics packaging and a color-reflective LCD screen. The Ruvi also featured mechanical linkages for zoom optics. It could record up to 350 stills on the cartridge, each still being able to hold up to five seconds of audio, and a search function that would display them all in sequence. An \"End Search\" button automatically located the end of recorded material, readying the camera for new recordings. Though it was considered an engineering marvel at the time of its release, the Ruvi achieved only mild success, mainly due to certain engineering trade offs to achieve a smaller size (such as using two AA batteries for power instead of the standard plug-in rechargeable battery). As a result, only one model was ever produced, the CCD-CR1, before the system was discontinued in 1999. The Ruvi was briefly released in the United States and the United Kingdom."

        "content": "The  is a large automobile produced by Nissan since 1960. It was developed to provide upscale transportation, competing with the Prince Skyline and Gloria which were later merged into the Nissan family. In later years, the Nissan Skyline was positioned as a sports sedan/coupe, whereas the Nissan Gloria was turned into a sporty version of the Cedric (with identical styling but using a different radiator grille and front & rear light clusters). In Japan, the Cedric/Gloria series was affectionately called CedGlo, and this long-running series finally came to an end in October 2004, replaced by the Nissan Fuga. The Cedric name is still in use, on the Y31 series fleet vehicle traditionally used as a taxi, where it competes with the Toyota Comfort, and is still in production. Throughout the many versions of the Cedric, it was always considered to be the prime competitor to the Toyota Crown. The hood ornament was inspired by the diamond pattern used by Lincoln but was changed to two right angles set next to each other. During the 1970s, it briefly saw other Japanese competitors introduce large sedans: the Mitsubishi Debonair, while the Isuzu Statesman de Ville and the Mazda Roadpacer were derived from General Motors-Australia products and were short-lived. In 1985 Honda introduced its rival to Cedric called Legend, which influence the Japanese car makers that time to update their luxury car line up. The Cedric name was inspired by the main character, Cedric, in Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel Little Lord Fauntleroy by the Nissan CEO at the time Katsuji Kawamata."

The chassis was a multi-tubular spaceframe, of similar design to the 1962 Lotus 22 Formula Junior. A  Ford Cosworth 105E with Single Choke Weber or SU carburettors produced  at 8000rpm. The 31 had little success against the more advanced monocoque cars that dominated in 1964. Records show only 12 were built in 1964/5. In 1966 19 cars were built with the Chassis 22/F3. The relative simplicity and low price of the car made it an ideal training car. Motor Racing Stables at Brands Hatch ran four cars to graduate students from Lotus Cortinas. The Jim Russell Racing Driver School ran the cars at Snetterton, later being recognised as a club by the RAC. The JIm Russell School ran five 31's at Brands Hatch BARC Trophy Races in July 1967."

        "content": "The Lotus 30 was a racing automobile, Colin Chapman's first attempt at a large displacement sports car racing machine following the success of the more convential tube frame Lotus 19,19b and Lotus 23., it was designed by Colin Chapman and Martin Wade, and built in 1964. The Lotus 30 was raced in British races such as Guards Trophy, international races such as Nassau Speed Week that allowed FIA Group 4 \"Sports Car\" class of racing machines, and more importantly, in Can Am series.  These were before the recognition and creation of Group 5, 6 and 7 categories by FIA in 1966.  This explains why Lotus 30 and 40 (the latter was built in 1965) came originally equipped with headlights, tail lights and a windshield wiper. Notable for its curvilinear fibreglass body work and \"pickle fork\" backbone chassis first seen in the front engine Lotus Elan, On the 30 the layout was reversed and placed the engine behind the driver.  Lotus engineer Len Terry was asked by Chapman to comment on the draft concept and considered it to be so flawed he refused to have anything to do with it.  The Lotus 30 was powered by a 4.7 litre (289 c.i.) Ford V8 engine, the same type as used in the Ford GT40, mated to a 5 speed ZF syncromesh 5DS20 transaxle which was far more reliable than Colotti transaxle in 19B handling the V8 torque.  It used 13 inch wheels and solid disc brakes on each wheel.  The Lotus 30 was regarded as unsuccessful and / or dangerous but when everything was working and nothing broke, the car was incredibly fast. The inherent flaws of the engineering became evident as horse power requirements and tire technology of the period evolved and pushed the original design past its intended limits. The problems were mainly related to the torsional rigidity of the backbone chassis and materials available at the time, all of which resulted in chassis and suspension failures. Jim Clark laboured long with the car, and managed to prise some promising results with it before it was replaced with the Lotus 40. Equipped with 15in wheels and vented disc brakes as well as a larger engine, the 40 was just as recalcitrant as the 30. The most telling comment about these Lotus race cars was made by the American driver Richie Ginther. When asked what he thought of the new Lotus 40, Ginther, a lugubrious Californian, said, \"Same as the 30 but with ten more mistakes\". The effort was not a total loss as this chassis type proved to be perfectly acceptable for the lower powered Lotus Europa, and was used on the Esprit series cars with further development."

After the facelift of 1983, the SEAT Fura Dos (two) was introduced: it didn\u2019t differ much from its predecessor mainly through smaller headlights and turn signals. The launch of the first generation SEAT Ibiza in April 1984 made the car largely redundant.

The camera was launched at the Photo Marketing Association Annual Show on February 18, 2002. It was Sigma's first digital camera, and was the first production camera to use the unique Foveon X3 image sensor, which reads full color at each pixel site.  Other sensors detect only one color at each site and interpolate to produce a full-color image. The SD9 had two separate power systems; one set of CR-123A lithium batteries in the handgrip powered the camera functions, while another pair of CR-V3 batteries or four AA size rechargeable batteries in a battery tray in the base powered the digital functions.  This split power system showed that the camera functions (inherited from Sigma's SA-9 film SLR) were not integrated at all with the digital half. Another unusual feature of the SD9 was its \"dust cover\" filter right behind the lens mount, to prevent dust getting into the chamber and onto the sensor when changing lenses. Reviewers and users reported good results in good lighting, but poorer ones in low light using either high ISO sensitivity or longer exposures. The SD9 was succeeded by an updated model, the SD10, which addressed the power and low-light issues."

During the 1950s and 1960s BR procured a wide range of Type\u00a01 diesel locomotives, many of them under the Pilot Scheme. However, several officials felt that the single-cabbed arrangement used by the majority of Type\u00a01s presented drivers with visibility difficulties in the 'less convenient' direction. BR therefore approached several manufacturers to seek a new locomotive that had a centre cab and low bonnets to maximise visibility. Clayton were selected to produce their proposed locomotive as the Class\u00a017. Its low engine covers required the use of a pair of Paxman 6ZHXL six-cylinder horizontal engines, which had been intended for powering railcars; it was a somewhat unorthodox arrangement for the era. Production of the Class 17 was undertaken between 1962 and 1965, with the locomotives being assigned to the north of Britain and the Scottish Region. Early on it was determined that the locomotive was not suited to heavy freight trains, and they quickly acquired a reputation for unreliability largely due to the engines, which continued to deliver poor performance even after extensive modifications. The Class 17 proved to be one of the least successful of the Type\u00a01s. Withdrawals took place from the late 1960s to 1971, some locomotives having a working life of less than five years. Several were sold to industrial users; only one example has been preserved."

Styled by Beno\u00eet Jacob under the direction of Patrick le Qu\u00e9ment, Renault's vice president of corporate design at the time, the Fiftie used a mid-engine/rear-wheel-drive layout, with its exterior styling drew heavily on its ancestor's \u2014 though with a two-door, mid-engine configuration rather than the 4CV's four door, rear-engine/rear-drive layout.  The Fiftie was part of a trend toward retrospective designs, including the VW New Beetle, Mini Cooper and Fiat 500. The Fiftie used an aluminum frame from the Renault Sport Spider and a carbon fiber body.  Its interior used cotton, linen, and rattan extensively, with a picnic basket concealed in the boot/trunk.  Front styling recalled the horizontal chrome 'mustache bars' of the original 4CV, with the addition of distinctive apostrophe-shaped headlights.

The Argosy was developed during the early-to-mid 1920s in response to a statement by Imperial Airways that new multi-engined airliners were being sought to replace its single-engined counterparts then in use. Armstrong Whitworth proposed a relatively large biplane airliner, powered by three Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar engines; its construction largely composed of plywood and fabric supported by steel tubing. Imperial Airways opted to initially order a pair of aircraft to serve its European routes, while the Air Ministry ordered a single example as well. On 16 March 1926, the first Argosy, G-EBLF, performed its maiden flight. Following the delivery of the second aircraft to Imperial Airways, the Argosy performed its first passenger flight on 16 July 1926, flying from London to Paris. Using the type, Imperial Airways inaugurated the world's first named air service, the luxury 'Silver Wing' service, between these two cities. The type would be operated by the airline for nine years, during which time a total of three Argosies would be lost in accidents, although only one of these resulted in fatalities.

It is like the Dash 9-44CW, but features AC traction motors instead of DC, with a separate inverter per motor. In appearance, the AC4400CW is somewhat similar to GE's more powerful locomotive, the AC6000CW. Over the 11 years in which it was produced, GE constructed 2,834 examples for North American railroads. In 2005, all Class I freight railroads except Norfolk Southern owned at least one AC4400CW. As a result of more stringent emissions requirements that came into effect on January of that year, GE no longer offers the AC4400CW, replacing it with the ES44AC."

The gun was developed in 1939\u20131941 and entered service in 1942. With 23,303 examples produced, the Pak 40 formed the backbone of German anti-tank guns for the later part of World War II, mostly in towed form, but also on a number of self propelled artillery such as the Marder series of Panzerj\u00e4ger A modified version of the gun designed specifically for vehicle-mounting was the 7.5 cm KwK 40, which differed primarily in using more compact ammunition, thereby allowing more rounds to be carried inside the vehicles. The KwK 40 armed many of the German mid-war tank and tank destroyer designs, replacing the Pak 40 in the latter role. The Pak 40 may be referred to as the 7.5/L46, referring to it's calibre and the barrel's length in calibres. There were two versions of the KwK 40, which would be referred to as the 7.5/L43 or 7.5/L48."

Based on the PS platform, it was the first vehicle built under Mitsubishi's \"Project America\", a program aimed at introducing vehicles for North America without having to compromise to accommodate other export markets. Its design origins can be traced back to the Mitsubishi SSU which debuted at the 1999 North American International Auto Show, although the Endeavor does not share the concept's mechanical underpinnings. The prototype was powered by a  version of the 6A13TT 2.5\u00a0liter twin-turbo V6, which directed the power to a full-time all wheel drive system through its INVECS-II five-speed automatic transmission and AYC. When the Endeavor debuted, it used the 6G75 3.8\u00a0liter V6 offering  (improved to  in 2004) and , mated to a four-speed automatic transmission with an optional all-wheel-drive system that splits the torque 50/50 by default. In 2011, the Endeavor again featured a 3.8L V6 but upgraded once more to produce  and  of torque. It received a mild restyle for the 2006 model year. Despite some reasonably favorable reviews on its release, the Endeavor's performance in the marketplace failed to meet Mitsubishi's expectations. On its release in March 2003 the company aimed for 80,000 annual sales but achieved only 32,054 by the end of its debut year, and sales fell every year since. Mitsubishi did not produce any 2009 Endeavor models for the retail market.  They did produce a 2009 model for fleet customers that are turning up as used, off-lease vehicles. They share the exterior appearance with the 2010 model, however, are equipped with cloth interior and Bluetooth. For the 2010 model year, the Endeavor gets another facelift, with newer front and rear fascias. The 2010 Endeavor went on sale in June 2009. It only came in one trim level for 2010, lacking the navigation package of the 2008 Limited trim, but equipped with leather seating and hands-free Bluetooth calling.

The Belta is sold as the second generation Vios in China, Taiwan and selected Southeast Asian countries. In the United States, Canada, Middle East and Australia, it is marketed as the Yaris Sedan, replacing the Echo sedan. In June 2012, the Japanese-market Belta was discontinued and replaced by the E160 series Corolla, and it was dropped in the US and Canada to be replaced by the Mazda2-based Yaris sedan/Scion iA in 2016; the XP130 series Vitz-based Yaris Liftback would be offered in those countries for several years. However, the Belta was still produced in Japan for export to Mexico and Australia until it was discontinued in both countries in 2016. For the Asian market, the XP150 series Vios replaced the XP90 model in 2013 as the sedan counterpart to the XP150 Yaris hatchback. The \"Belta\" nameplate was revived in November 2021 for the rebadged Suzuki Ciaz sold in certain Middle Eastern countries.

Both rode on a pair of three-axle trucks with all three axles on each truck powered; this is a C-C wheel arrangement.  These trucks have an unequal axle spacing due to traction motor positioning; the outer two axles on each truck are closer together than the inner two. The RSD-7 used the GE 752 traction motor.

General Electric self-proclaimed this electric locomotive to be the \u201cKing of the Rails\u201d in a silent promotional film from 1915. In 1919, with the arrival of a newer generation of passenger power, the EP-1 locomotives were converted to EF-1 freight locomotives, and renumbered 10230\u201310241.

They had roller bearings on all axles, and the first-built, No. 300, had roller bearings on its side and main rods too. No. 300 also bore \"Elephant ear\" smoke deflectors from 1948.

These were the last express passenger steam locomotives ordered by a United States railroad, and some of the most expensive at $353,346 each, 80% more than the cost of the 8 earlier L-2 locomotives. Both classes were among the largest 4-6-4s ever built, and they were even more powerful than the C&O's L-1 class. They were intended to work the C&O's top-flight express trains on level ground; the railroad purchased 4-8-4 \"Greenbrier\" types for mountain service. By 1953, C&O passenger services were wholly dieselized, and there was no more work for these locomotives to do. Hudson locomotives were very unsuited to freight work, with such a comparatively small proportion of their weight on the drivers. All the L2\u2019s and L2a\u2019s were quickly scrapped by 1953."

The Packard Executive was introduced on March 5, 1956 to fill a perceived price gap between the prestige Packard line and the new Clipper marque, which was in its first year as a separate marque.  In previous years, Clipper models had been Packards.  The most expensive Clipper, the Clipper Custom, listed at $3,065 for the 4-door sedan. The Packard Executive sedan retailed for $3,465, the Executive 2-door coupe $3,560, while the top-of-the-line Patrician sedan sold for $4,160. The Executive was marketed with the invitation to \u201center the luxury car class now\u2014at a modest investment,\u201d and was aimed at \"the young man on the way up.\" Effectively, the Packard Executive replaced the entire Clipper Custom line of vehicles, as production of the Customs was ended once the Executive was announced. The Executive was created by combining the Clipper Custom's body, complete with its distinctive tail light design, and installing the front fenders, hood, and radiator grille assembly of the senior Packard models. It also used the Clipper Custom's  wheelbase and its   all new, Packard designed  overhead valve V8 engine. This contrasted with the engine used by the top level 1956 Packard Patrician, which displaced  and developed  ( for the Caribbean). Beyond the senior Packard grille and front end sheet metal, Executives were further distinguished from the Clipper line by a unique side trim design that made reference to the senior Packards, and allowed for two-toned paint schemes. However, the interior appointments and instrumentation were pure Clipper. The prototypes produced for the all-new 1957 Packard and Clipper lines show an all-new Executive that would become a baseline Packard. All 1957 Clippers would have an all-new body which shared many inner panels with the all-new large Studebaker. Body panel sharing was the new plan for Studebaker-Packard models. Unfortunately the Insurance Companies would not finance the ambitious plan, and SPC was forced to retrench and ended up sharing body panels with the midsize Studebaker models. There was a 1957 Clipper, the last year to carry that name. Originally, the plan was to call the 1957 model an Executive. It was hoped to be a bridge car until an all-new big Packard could be introduced. See Facel-Vega for a 1959 proposal for a rebadged Packard. Executives received their own series designation of 5670. It was offered in two body styles; a two-door hardtop (model 5677), and a four-door Touring Sedan (model 5672). Although the Executive sold as fast as it was produced,  it was not enough to substantially improve the financial picture for the Packard-Clipper Division. Even as the Executive was being announced, the media had already been reporting of sales and fiscal woes at the Studebaker-Packard Corporation, and rumors were flying the Packard marque might be discontinued.  These rumors weighed heavily on the company\u2019s efforts to sell any of its products. Buyers did not wish to be stuck with a so-called \u201corphan\u201d car, where spare parts would no longer be available from a dealer, and resale values would be negatively impacted. During the Executive's shortened model year of March through June, Packard built a total of 2,779 Executives\u20141,031 two-door hardtops and 1,748 four-door sedans. All Detroit production of Packard and Clipper models ceased 25 June 1956 with the shuttering of the Conner Avenue assembly plant. The Packard name was continued for the 1957 and 1958 model years on products based on Studebaker platforms, built on the same assembly lines in South Bend, Indiana as the Studebaker models."

Takachiho played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905 where she participated in the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, briefly helped to blockade Port Arthur at the beginning of the war, helped to sink a Russian armored cruiser during Battle off Ulsan and participated in the climatic defeat of the Imperial Russian Navy in the Battle of Tsushima. The ship was relegated to auxiliary roles as a depot ship and a training ship after the war and was converted into a minelayer in 1911. Takachiho was torpedoed and sunk by a German torpedo boat in 1914 during the Siege of Tsingtao in World War I with the loss of most of her crew."

        "title": "Suzuki GSV-R_Summary",
        "content": "Suzuki GSV-R is the name of the series of four-stroke V4 prototype motorcycles developed by Suzuki to compete in the MotoGP World Championship. GSV-R replaced Suzuki's 500\u00a0cc two-stroke V4 RGV500 which was ridden by Kenny Roberts Jr. to win the 500cc World Championship in 2000. The GSV-R was introduced on 2002, one year earlier than the original plan, with codename XRE0. New regulations were promoting the growth of four-stroke engines, and the performance of the new engine during testing was strong according to Suzuki. Despite the use of a new engine, XRE0 was using the old RGV500 Gamma Chassis, which was later criticized as a big mistake by many MotoGP analysts. Using the chassis and fairings that were previously made for the two-stroke RGV500 engine, XRE0 was hampered by many stability issues. The use of RGV500 Tyre spec was another mistake. Despite all of that, XRE0 was able to taste its first podium (2nd place) on the opening round at Suzuka and got third place at Rio in the same year. XRE0 achievements however were inconsistent, as the riders often fell down, crashed, or were forced to retire by technical failures. The top XRE0 rider by the end of The 2002 MotoGP Championship was Kenny Roberts Jr. in ninth place overall. For 2007, MotoGP rules were changed to allow a maximum displacement of 800\u00a0cc. Suzuki introduced an 800\u00a0cc version of the GSV-R also known as GSV-R800.  The GSV-R800 was codenamed XRG0 because of its newly redesigned engine based on displacement limitations.  The new XRG0 engine was based from the layout of the 2006 990\u00a0cc GSV-R however, the XRG0 engines bore, stroke, and cylinder pitch had been redesigned to better suit the 800\u00a0cc engine displacement.  The factory Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team stated the new engines aim was to \u2018achieve the best possible horsepower and reliable high rpm operation, and to provide the riders with user friendly power delivery and predictable engine character.\u2019   The XRG0 was also equipped with a redesigned engine control unit supplied by Mitsubishi, capable of producing 220 horsepower at 17,500\u00a0rpm.  The chassis layout and wheelbase length from the 2006 GSV-R XRE4 used in the 2006 MotoGP season remained on the new model, however the fairing design had been updated to better accommodate high speed stability. The 2008 MotoGP season brought another redesigned GSV-R800 that Suzuki codenamed XRG1 as the successor to the XRG0 of the previous year.  This second generation 800\u00a0cc four-stroke prototype was the most complex and technically advanced racing motorcycle Suzuki had ever produced at its time.  The XRG1 had been developed closely with team riders Chris Vermeulen and Loris Capirossi and the feedback from the MotoGP team and Suzuki test engineers.  A key focus area in refining the XRG1 was improving acceleration.  This was accomplished by refining every detail of the 2007 XRG0 engine and an updated Mitsubishi ECU.  The resulted engine redesigning provided lower fuel consumption and increased usability.  Further refinements of the XRG0 chassis for the 2008 XRG1 allowed for better cornering performance and change of direction.  Along with the chassis refinements, a newly designed fairing  was developed to reduce wind resistance to enhance handling characteristics. At the end of 2011 Suzuki pulled out of MotoGP until at least 2014, citing the need to reduce costs amid the global economic downturn."

It was available in two- or four-door, five passenger, front engine, rear- or four-wheel drive configurations. Sharing the name of the original, full-size Cherokee SJ model, the 1984 XJ Cherokee was Jeep's first all-new design since the 1963 SJ Wagoneer, as well as the first American off-road vehicle built with fully integrated body-and-frame (unibody) design, and formed the mechanical basis for the Jeep Comanche (MJ) pickup truck (1985\u20131992). Jeep marketed XJs as Sportwagons, precursor to the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV), before that term was used. The XJ is credited for spawning competitors, as other automakers noticed the design cannibalizing sales from regular cars, supplanting the role of the station wagon and transforming the vehicle type \"from truck to limousine in the eyes of countless suburban owners,\" though GM had also launched road-biased, RWD and 4WD compact SUVs, the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and GMC S-15 Jimmy, one year earlier, initially available in 2-door form only. The 2007 book Jeep Off-Road called the XJ a \"significant link in the evolution of the 4x4.\" In 2011 Kiplinger magazine selected the XJ as one of the \"cars that refuse to die.\" Automotive journalist Robert Cumberford, writing for Automobile, called the Jeep XJ one of the 20 greatest cars of all time \u2014 for its design, and \"possibly the best SUV shape of all time, it is the paradigmatic model to which other designers have since aspired.\""

Mechanically, the AC-10s were exceptionally similar to their immediate predecessors, the AC-8s. The first AC-10, number 4205, entered service on February 17, 1942, and the last, 4244, on August 19, 1942.  SP used these locomotives for about fifteen years, with the first retirements of this class (three locomotives) occurring on April 5, 1955 and the last (three more of the class) on September 24, 1958.

They were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works during World War II, with the first, number 4275, entering service on October 27, 1943, and the last, 4294, on March 19, 1944. The locomotives were effectively a conventional 2-8-8-4 locomotive running in reverse; the tender being coupled at the smokebox end of the locomotive. This was made possible by the use of oil-firing. The distinct features of these locomotives include: a streamlined front with white band, an air horn on the front, a streamlined pilot, a SP 12 wheel box tender, and air compressors mounted on the smokebox. Southern Pacific used these locomotives all over its system, but they were extremely famous for working on Donner Pass & Cascade Summit. SP used the AC-12s for a little over a decade with the first retirements occurring on April 5, 1955, and the last on September 24, 1958.

For 2007, the 3.5\u00a0L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9\u00a0L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional AWD system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9\u00a0L engine. Also in 2007, the Relay received an optional flex-fuel engine but only for fleet applications. The Relay scored three \"Good\"s (the highest possible score) and two \"acceptable\"s (the second highest possible score) in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests. In terms of gas mileage, the Relay is rated at  city,  highway. The Relay started at US$22,850. There were three available trim levels, 1, 2, 3.

Slotted between the C/K trucks and the GMC Brigadier Class 8 conventional, the Kodiak/TopKick were developed as a basis for vocationally-oriented trucks, including cargo haulers, dump trucks, and similar vehicles; on later generations, both cutaway and cowled-chassis variants were produced for bus use. Following years of declining market share, General Motors (in line with Ford Motor Company) sought to exit heavy-truck manufacturing. After struggling to enter joint ventures or sell the rights to its product line, the company ended production of the Kodiak and TopKick in 2009.

On the exterior of the Superba, the grille was composed of an arched center section, flanked two-chrome wings; engine compartment ventilation was through 24 rectangular sections located in the center of the grille. Parking lights were placed on two solid panels flanking the ventilation spaces and housed in round star-like housings. When the Checker Marathon was introduced in the fall of 1959 it was only marketed in New York and the states of New England. In February of 1960 the Checker was introduced nationally. In 1962, the Superba received its only exterior change, a more sculptured front bumper raised up several inches. Additionally front fenders sculpturing was raised three inches. Larger rear wheel openings were increased on the rear fenders. The Starburst grille was replaced with a full-width egg-crate grille.

It was being developed by Polish manufacturer PZL Warszawa-Okecie during the late 1980s and early 1990s. During the late 1980s, PZL was inspired to commence development of a new aircraft which was to be relatively manoeuvrable, capable of short take-off and landing (STOL) performance, and carrying a 2,000kg payload while remaining a low-cost platform to procure and to operate. Original designs for the aircraft revolved around a twin-turboprop engine, at one point, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67A engine was selected to power the type. However, the proposal was radically changed following a decision to submit it to a requirement issued for Polish Air Force which sought a light strike and battlefield support aircraft; accordingly, the payload was doubled and the speed was raised dramatically. The revised design was instead powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PW305 turbofan engines. Named the Skorpion, it featured a fuselage afterbody that was blended into the wing along with a set of small canards behind the cockpit. During June 1994, the Polish Ministry of Defense announced that the Skorpion programme would receive no further funding from the Polish government. The abrupt withdrawal of support after having been recognised two years earlier as a government-approved programme was widely attributed to the formation of a new left-wing Polish government led by Waldemar Pawlak. Despite fears that this was the programme's end, PZL decided to initially continue with development independently. By late 1994, according to the aircraft's chief designer, Andrzej Frydrychewicz, the aerodynamic configuration of the Skorpion, with the exception of the tail, had been frozen. As of its 1994 redesign, performance estimates for the Skorpion included a maximum level speed of 540 kt (1,000km/h), a 32,800 ft (10,000 m) service ceiling and a 300 km (160nm) combat radius. By December 1994, the stealth characteristics of the aircraft had been deemphasised. According to the company's estimates, the official development cost was promoted as being PZ11,500 billion ($65 million); however, Frydrychewicz speculated that this figure was relatively optimistic and may have been produced with political interests in mind."

        "content": "The ALCO FA was a family of B-B diesel locomotives designed to haul freight trains. The locomotives were built by a partnership of ALCO and General Electric in Schenectady, New York, between January 1946 and May 1959. Designed by General Electric's Ray Patten (along with their ALCO PA cousins), they were of a cab unit design; both cab-equipped lead (A unit) FA and cabless booster (B unit) FB models were built. A dual passenger-freight version, the FPA/FPB, was also offered. It was equipped with a steam generator for heating passenger cars. ALCO's designation of F marks these locomotives as being geared primarily for freight use, whereas the P designation of the PA sets indicates that they were geared for higher speeds and passenger use. However, beyond this their design was largely similar - aside from the PA/PB's both being larger A1A-A1A types with an even more striking nose - and many railroads used FA and PA locomotives for both freight and passenger service. Several examples of FAs and FBs have been preserved. While most are now in the care of railroad museums, a few remain in operational status on such lines as the Grand Canyon Railway and the Napa Valley Wine Train."

        "content": "The Isuzu Bellel is a compact car produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Isuzu from 1961 to 1966. It was the company's first independent design, and also Japan's first passenger car with a diesel engine. It was available as a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon, called the Bellel Express. The Bellel Express was technically speaking a commercial vehicle, as was the custom in Japan at the time. The name \"Bellel\" resulted from combining the English word \"bell\" with the Roman numeral \"L\", equalling 50, and thus the name was supposed to represent \"fifty Bells\" (Isuzu literally means \"fifty bells\" in Japanese), and reflects a tradition within Isuzu of naming products that use terms that have special significance in Japan. Production began in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo in October 1964, with initial release in select Japanese cities starting in April 1962. The Bellel was fitted with 1.5\u00a0L and 2.0\u00a0L gasoline OHV engines with a Bosch licensed fuel injection system, and also the aforementioned  2.0\u00a0L diesel (DL201) engine. The original diesel engine was called the DL200; it offered . All engines were mated with a four-speed manual transmission with the shifter mounted on the steering column. The suspension setup was modeled after the Hillman Minx, which was previously manufactured by Isuzu under a license agreement with the Rootes Group. The list of standard equipment expanded so that it could compete for sales against more popular products from more prolific Japanese  manufacturers, helping to justify the yearly road tax bill for using a large displacement engine, while remaining compliant with Japanese Government dimension regulations. As the private car ownership market in Japan began to grow, the Bellel was offered as an alternative to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric, and the Prince Gloria. The original end treatment was updated in October 1965 in an attempt to afford the Bellel a more formal, upscale and mainstream look. The facelift included changes to the front fascia, where the previous single round headlights paired with smaller turn signals were replaced by quad round headlights arranged vertically. The diesel engine - a first for a Japanese passenger car - made the Bellel popular for commercial applications, such as taxicab services. This partially helped to offset the Bellel's relative unpopularity with private customers, which resulted from the harshness of the early diesel engine and peculiar styling. A small number of these cars found their way into other countries, with the Bellel also offered with left-hand drive. 37,206 Bellels were manufactured in total (including the Express wagon/van), with production coming to an end in May 1967. Isuzu had a long history of manufacturing diesel engine products, and noticed in Europe that the Mercedes Benz and Peugeot intermediate class sedans also offered a diesel engine option and decided to offer one as well."

It employed a clamshell design in which the display closes over the keyboard, like the earlier GRiD Compass and contemporary Gavilan SC. The PC-5000 was largely IBM PC-compatible, with the same 4.77-MHz Intel 8088 processor as the IBM PC, and ran MS-DOS 2.0 (in ROM). It had 128 kilobytes of internal memory (it was one of the few computers to use bubble memory), which could be expanded by the use of plug-in cartridges. The cartridge slots also accepted ROM cartridges containing software, such as the Extended BASIC programming language and the EasyPac software suite, which contained the EasyWrite II word processor, EasyReport reports program, and EasyComm terminal software for use with the internal modem. It featured a 640\u00d780-pixel (80-character by 8-line) LCD display, a full-travel keyboard, and an external dual 5.25-inch floppy disk drive. A notable feature of the computer was its built-in thermal printer, which could also be purchased separately and attached to the machine. It is perhaps due to this attachment that the case design of the PC-5000 owes much to that of electronic typewriters of its time. While far more portable than the popular Compaq Portable or Osborne 1 computers, the machine weighed 5 kg (11\u00a0lb). Sharp succeeded the PC-5000 with the fully IBM-compatible PC-7000 in late 1985."

The first modern \"megaships\" to be built, they also were the first series of cruise ships to include a multi-story atrium with glass elevators, which the ship's designer, Nj\u00e5l Eide, referred to as the \"Centrum\". They also had a single deck devoted entirely to cabins with private balconies instead of oceanview cabins. The first ship, Sovereign of the Seas launched in 1988, was the world's largest passenger ship in service, breaking the record held by  (originally designed as an ocean liner). Sovereign held this distinction until 1990 when Norway succeeded her after being refurbished with the addition of two more decks. In 1991, Royal Caribbean International launched a slightly modified sister ship, Monarch of the Seas. In 1992, the line launched its third and final sister ship, Majesty of the Seas. These ships were among the largest modern cruise ships to sail during the late 1980s and early 1990s. During that time, other major cruise lines also followed suit, building ships that included many of the same features and similar dimensions as the Sovereign class. Carnival Cruise Lines launched the  in 1990, comparable in size to the Sovereign class and also featuring a multi-story atrium with glass elevators. Princess Cruises also countered by launching two ships in 1990 and 1991 to compete with the Sovereign class,  Crown Princess and Regal Princess. They also featured an atrium and two decks devoted to cabins with private balconies instead of windowed \"oceanview\" cabins. Since then, newer and larger ships have exceeded the size of the Sovereign-class ships. They are less than half the size of the  ships and about a third the size of  ships. In 2007, Monarch of the Seas became the first major cruise liner in the world to be captained by a woman, the Swede Karin Stahre Janson, who remained the only one until 2010 when the British captain Sarah Breton took charge of  of P&O Cruises. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd transferred Sovereign of the Seas and Monarch of the Seas from Royal Caribbean International to their Pullmantur Cruises subsidiary in 2008 and 2013, respectively. Plans to transfer Majesty of the Seas to Pullmantur in 2016 had been announced in November 2014. However in July 2015, Royal Caribbean reversed those plans, instead stating that Majesty of the Seas would stay with Royal Caribbean International and be receiving a massive overhaul and upgrade in early 2016 to bring her up to today's standards. As of July 2020, the first two ships, Sovereign and Monarch, have been sold for scrap, due to the bankruptcy of Pullmantur Cruises. In December 2020, Royal Caribbean sold the remaining ship Majesty of the Seas to Seajets who renamed her Majesty. Seajets renamed the ship Majesty of the Oceans in April 2021, while still laid up at Piraeus."

Following the discontinuation of the Sixteenth Series Twelve after the 1939 model year, a new Custom Super Eight One-Eighty was derived from the Super Eight as the new top car range. The Super Eight was renamed the Super Eight One-Sixty starting a naming convention change in 1940. These two models shared most mechanical components including the 160 HP straight Eight engine and continued to be regarded as the Senior Packard. After 1942, Packard concentrated on the new Clipper styling that was developed for an upper-class sedan the previous year. There were Super Clippers and Custom Super Clipper in the One-Sixty and One-Eighty tradition until 1947. After a heavy facelift, the name Clipper was dropped. The most senior Super Eight One-Eighty became the Custom Eight, while its slightly lower-priced sibling, the Super Eight One-Sixty, once again became simply the Super Eight. Clipper Custom Super Eights and Custom Eights were very close relatives to their respective Super models, distinguished outside by the lack of an eggcrate grille and small rear chrome trim moulding under the trunk lid on Supers. In 1949, a new Super Eight Deluxe was added to the line. This car had also the Custom Eight's eggcrate grille, but not the rear trim.

        "content": "The Toot-a-Loop Radio or Panasonic R-72 is a novelty radio made by Panasonic Japan in the early 1970s. This radio was designed to be wrapped around the wrist (provided your wrist wasn't too large). It also came with stickers for customizing the unit. Reception was the AM broadcast band only - no FM (the FM version of this radio is called RF-72). The radio was shaped something like a donut with the hole off-center. When twisted, the smaller half would pivot and the larger half would separate, forming an \"S\" shape.  One side of the radio had a grille behind which sat the speaker. There was also a jack for a mono earplug. The tuner was located inside one of the \"splits,\" so the radio had to be twisted into the \"S\" position in order to be tuned, but the volume control was on the outer diameter of the radio and could be adjusted regardless of whether the radio was twisted open or closed.  The Toot-a-Loop came in several colors including white, red, blue, and yellow. It was also produced in orange and lime, which were sold in Australia and New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand models had the badging National Panasonic and were advertised as a \"Sing-O-Ring\" radio. Also known by collectors as a bangle or wrist radio. The advertisement song went \"It's an S it's an O it's a crazy radio! Toot a loop!\"."

In particular, the satellite was designed to demonstrate \"autonomous rendezvous and proximity maneuvers.\" In other words, it would approach, investigate, and photograph other spacecraft in Earth orbit. It would help test the feasibility of in-space inspection and repair. The spacecraft was also designed to test systems that would allow the spacecraft to maneuver autonomously. USA-165 was built by Lockheed Martin and weighed 125\u00a0kg with an excess of 600\u00a0m/s delta-v.  USA-165 was launched into Low Earth Orbit on April 11, 2005 on a Minotaur rocket and remained in its primary orbit for over eighteen months, but then in December 2006 it was maneuvered into a disposal orbit and lost to satellite spotters. USA-165 was later rediscovered by amateur satellite watcher Kevin Fetter. The satellite re-entered the atmosphere on November 11, 2013. The NASA GRAIL spacecraft design was based on XSS-11 design."

Built between 1917 and 1934, it was the first non-Great Western Railway (GWR) type to use and improve upon the basic design principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The N\u00a0class was based on the GWR 4300 Class design, improved with Midland Railway concepts. The N\u00a0class was mechanically similar to the SECR K\u00a0class 2-6-4 passenger tank engine, also by Maunsell. It influenced future 2-6-0 development in Britain and provided the basis for the 3 cylinder N1\u00a0class of 1922. Production was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and the first N\u00a0class rolled out of Ashford Works in 1917, three years after design work was completed. The class replaced obsolete 0-6-0s as part of the SECR's fleet standardisation, as they used parts interchangeable with those of other classes. Eighty N\u00a0class locomotives were built in three batches between the First and Second World Wars. Fifty were assembled from kits of parts made at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, giving rise to the nickname of \"Woolworths\". They worked over most of the Southern Railway (SR) network, and were used by the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) until the last was withdrawn in 1966. One N\u00a0class locomotive is preserved on the Swanage Railway in Dorset, undergoing overhaul."

As a result, the Noble M15 has a number of features not previously found on Nobles such as satellite navigation, traction control, electric windows and ABS. Noble founder Lee Noble has been quoted in indicating \"the M12 is a great car, but it's very focused and [he] wanted to produce a supercar people could use every day... It was time for Noble to take a big step up in terms of refinement, practicality and style.\"  Despite increased comfort and usability compared to previous Noble cars, Lee Noble has also stated that the M15 is significantly quicker than the M400 around a race track."

Though never imported into the US, the rest of the world, including Canada, received some of these models. The DT200LC began production in 1983bc. It also was very similar to the DT125LC. This model continued production until 1988.Then, in 1989 a totally new model was introduced, DT200R, as well as a similar DT125R. In Canada, the DT125LC/R was never imported. In Canada, the new model sold until 1996. It continued on in South America, the Middle East, Europe, Australia, and Africa. It spawned the DT125, in two versions, as well as a WR200. Today it has been redesigned as a DT230R, as well as the DT200R for South America, which is a hybrid of the LC and R models.  Competition for the DT200R came from Suzuki's TS200RM, imported into Canada from 1991 until 1993. Honda never imported its superior CRM250 into North America. The DT200 or WR200 used a liquid cooled, oil injected, (autolube) case reed inducted, Y.P.V.S. power valved (electronically operated power valve system while motocross bikes are equipped with mechanically operated power valve system),flat slide carburetion, resin reeds, single cylinder, 2 stroke engine.  As a dual-purpose bike, it was designed for on and off-road use, Yamaha has another 2 models, the DT200WR with oil pump code 3xp, which was only sold in the Japanese home market, and WR200R with premix, code 4bf. The WR200R was sold in Canada, U.S.A., and many other countries around the world. The WR200R was sold as an off-road only model and had many similarities with the DT200WR. Some of the differences between the \"R\" and \"WR\" models were the oil pump, carburetor, TM30SS vs.TM28SS, larger reed cage with 6 petals vs. 4 petals, longest final gear for the 3xp, plastic tank vs.steel gas tank, little shorter seat height on DT200WR model, with the same design in full body generally the 3xp was the model for every day use, plus 10\u00a0kg of weight.

Based on a lengthened Minica platform, it was a larger version of the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini, a kei car.  The biggest visual difference from the Pajero Mini is the wide fender trims and wider tyres, giving it a more purposeful appearance. It did benefit from moderate ownership costs to Japanese buyers, due to the exterior dimension being within the favorable compact size class according to Japanese Government dimension regulations, and the small displacement engine obligated a minimal annual road tax, although at reduced advantage compared to the kei car-based Pajero Mini. For normal use, a basic rear wheel drive configuration is used for road performance and fuel consumption purposes.  However, it also has a selectable (which Mitsubishi called \"Easy-Select 4WD\") four wheel drive system (low and high gear ratios) for off-road driving.  Unlike many other mini SUVs, the Pajero Junior is said to be a very capable off-road vehicle with a decent amount of ground clearance. The 1094cc engine block is the same as used in the Mitsubishi Colt, developing 80\u00a0hp at 6500 rpm and giving the vehicle a top speed of 135\u00a0km/h.  The steering is a traditional rack and pinion setup, with power assistance.  The front suspension is double wishbone, and the rear is helical spring. The Mitsubishi Pajero Junior was discontinued in June 1998 due to the launch of its replacement, the Mitsubishi Pajero iO (known in Europe as the \"Pinin\").  By that time, Mitsubishi were aware that many Pajero Juniors were being unofficially exported to other countries, so an entirely new model was designed to take the vehicle away from its kei car roots and to support larger engine sizes for the international market, although only form factors and engines that fit within Japanese compact class were available for the newer car."

The first competition appearance of a Ford 3L prototype was at the BOAC 500 race at Brands Hatch in Kent. Despite apparent pace, the car was criticized for instability at high speeds and, due to mechanical and electrical failures, did not finish any of the races for which it was entered. For the 1969 season the P68 was used as the basis for an aborted, fully open Spyder, dubbed the Ford P69. The P69 sported large, free-standing aerofoil wings, which were vital to the car's stability at high-speeds. However, these were banned by the European sanctioning body early in the season, thus the P68 was not eligible to race in the respective class any longer ."

Preceding the RM lineup was the TM series, which included the TM 75, TM 100, TM 125, TM 250, and TM 400.  Motorcycles within the RM series continue to be manufactured today, the famous RM125 was discontinued in America in late 2008 . The 100 cc Rm100 was discontinued in 2005.  The Rm250 was discontinued by the 2008 model year.  This may possibly be related to changed class structure.  From 1999 to 2004, changes to the RM250 made 15 more stock horsepower, and a lower seat height."

At this time he was looking for work, showing drawings of his engine design to motorcycle manufacturers. The early engine with \"two transverse crankshafts\" was essentially a pair of 'across frame' OHC parallel twins joined by their geared central flywheels, with a four-cylinder block (or Monobloc) and single head. The idea for the engine was rejected by BSA, but adopted by Ariel. Thus it became the Ariel Square Four. In 1966 Phil Vincent wrote in Motor Cycle: \"Alas, in 1959 the Square Four went out of production, a victim of the modern trend towards small, high-revving modern power units. The demand had tailed off a bit, and with reduced output, the price would have had to be hoisted excessively high. At the time it was approaching \u00a3350\u2014out of reach of all but a few of the potential buyers.\" A further development was the Healey 1000/4 based on an updated Square Four, produced between 1971 and 1977."

It replaced the Bristol 401 and 402 in 1953 and continued in production for two years. It retained much the same styling as the 401, but featured many mechanical improvements compared to that model. The 1971 cc six-cylinder engine was modified through the use of bigger valves and larger main bearings with a diameter of 54\u00a0mm as against 51\u00a0mm on the 400 and 401, which increased the power output to  as against  on the 401. The acceleration was markedly improved: the 403 could reach  in 13.4\u00a0seconds as against 16.4\u00a0seconds for the 401. The 403 had top speed of . To cope with this increased power, an anti-roll bar was fitted on the front suspension and improved drum brakes known as \"Alfins\" (Aluminum finned) were fitted. Early models had them on all wheels, but Bristol thought the car was over-braked and they were thus restricted to the front wheels on later 403s. The 403 was the last Bristol to feature a BMW-style radiator grille. It is also noteworthy for having two extra headlamps at the side, almost pre-dating the adoption of the four-headlamp layout in larger cars (Bristol themselves adopted it with the 411 in the late 1960s)."

The Sunraycer, a joint collaboration between General Motors, AeroVironment, and Hughes Aircraft, won the first race in 1987 by a huge margin. The team's lead driver was Australian John Harvey, a driver with (at the time) nearly 40 years experience racing speedcars (Speedway), open wheelers, sports cars and touring cars. Harvey was involved with the testing and development of the Sunraycer at the General Motors Proving Ground, Arizona. The Sunraycer project started with a request from GM's Australian division to GM Headquarters to participate in the upcoming Solar Challenge. This race, to be held in Australia in late 1987 would feature purely solar powered cars.  Roger Smith, the CEO of GM, was immediately interested in the idea and he agreed to fund a study to see if a solar powered car could be built within 10 months. Smith hired AeroVironment to do the study. A month later, AeroVironment engineers concluded that a highly competitive car could be built within the time available. AeroVironment, led by their famous owner/engineer Paul MacCready was given the contract to build what would be called the Sunraycer. During the conceptual process, the constant goal was to create a very low-weight and ultra-low wind resistance vehicle. With this in mind, AeroVironment produced a design that proved to be very lightweight (only ) and created a very low drag coefficient (cd: 0.125). Sunraycer was fast and capable of a top speed of . A total of 8800 solar cells were manufactured and installed by a team, from Hughes Aircraft, which had a great deal of experience with photovoltaic cells used in the many communications satellites that they designed and built. At high noon, the car would generate about 1500 watts of power. The engine was created for the Sunraycer by GM using a brand new electric motor based on Magnequench permanent magnets. This kind of rare-earth magnet was invented in 1983 independently by the GM physics department and Sumitomo Special Metals. Both companies discovered and eventually were using/commercializing two significantly different manufacturing processes for this material class. The GM concept was commercialized under the Magnequench brand. The new motor was lightweight and efficient; GM stated its motor efficiency was around 92%. In 2011 its constructor won the IEEE Nikola Tesla Award. Aside from the driver, the single heaviest element in the car was the Hughes battery pack that utilized silver-oxide batteries. These batteries were included to provide extra power when passing trucks, to smooth out the performance of the vehicle, and because the race rules mandated driving only between the hours of 8 AM to 5 PM, but the cars were allowed to charge their batteries from sunlight even when they were not on the road. (So, the battery allowed driving during allowed hours even when the weather was overcast.) The frame of the car weighed just 14 pounds. AeroVironment engineers made use of Kevlar for the shell of the car. The Sunraycer was tested through the spring and summer of 1987, and it had no problems.  During the testing period, the team had the time to set a new world speed record with the Sunraycer, achieving a speed of  from solar power alone (breaking the old record by 10\u00a0mph)."

It is capable of duplicating the trajectory of the .300 Winchester Magnum, while generating significantly lower recoil. Also, converting a rifle chambered for the .308 Winchester (or any of its offspring, such as the .243 Winchester, 7mm-08 Remington, .358 Winchester or .338 Federal) to .260 Remington generally requires little more than a simple barrel change."

For the important taxi market, the 132 filled the niche, vacated with the withdrawal in 1970, of the diesel engined SEAT 1500, the 132 being usefully larger than the SEAT 124, which was SEAT's largest model during the beginning of the 1970s. SEAT's new car shared its body with the Fiat 132, but when launched in May 1973 it featured its own engine options: The SEAT 132 1600 had a four cylinder 1592\u00a0cc engine of  . The SEAT 132 1800 had a four cylinder 1756\u00a0cc engine of  . The SEAT 132 Diesel featured a two litre  Mercedes Benz engine, corresponding to that offered in the Mercedes Benz 200D. This followed the pattern established with the SEAT 1500, which had also been available with a diesel engine from Mercedes Benz. In 1976, an automatic transmission option was offered, which may have been a response to the success in Spain of the locally assembled, and similarly enhanced Chrysler Two Litre. From 1979, the SEAT 132 2000 became available, with one four cylinder 1920\u00a0cc engine of : in due course, one larger 2.2 litre, four cylinder Mercedes diesel version was also offered. In the beginning of the 1980s, extensive discussions concerning funding and control took place between the major share holder, the Government of Spain, and Fiat: SEAT needed major capital investment, which Fiat was not prepared to inject. The outcome, by 1982, was an end after nearly thirty years, to the relationship with Fiat. Already in 1981, Fiat having by now switched to their new model, the  Argenta, production of the SEAT 132 ceased, after approximately 100,000 examples had been produced. No direct replacement in this class was, up until 2009, offered by the company. The SEAT Exeo could be seen as the belated replacement, however."

        "title": "Selmer Mark VI_Summary",
        "content": "The Selmer Mark VI is a saxophone produced from 1954 to 1981. Production shifted to the Mark VII for the tenor and alto in the mid-1970s (see discussion of serial numbers below), and to the Super Action 80 for the soprano and baritone saxophones in 1981. The sopranino saw limited production until about 1985. Selmer debuted the Mark VI in 1954 with sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone and bass saxophones, until the introduction of the Mark VII model in 1975.  Since the Mark VI design continued for sopraninos, sopranos, baritones, or bass saxes, they did not have a Mark VII model. There are reports of a limited number of baritone saxophones labeled as Mark VIIs, but these horns were of the same design as the Mark VI. All Mark VI saxophones were manufactured in France. After manufacture, instruments designated for the British/Canadian or American markets were shipped unassembled and unengraved to their respective markets for completion. The style of engraving on the bell of the instrument is an indicator of the place of assembly. The French-assembled Mark VI engraving is usually of a butterfly and floral motif, and the engraving typically extends to the bow. Some French-assembled Mark VIs lack any engraving other than the brand stamp. Nickel or silver-plated keys with a lacquer-finish body were offered among the French-assembled horns. The British/Canadian Mark VIs often have a symmetrical medallion engraved on the front of the bell, and a design reminiscent of the chambered nautilus along the sides of the bell. American-assembled Mark VIs have floral or scroll engraving, with only the earliest models extending to the bow. The Mark VI is played by many saxophonists including Jimmy Heath, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Maceo Parker, and David Sanborn. The design of the Mark VI evolved over time. Switching over from its predecessor, officially named the Super Action but commonly called the Super Balanced Action, Selmer's earliest Mark VI models were transitional, incorporating design elements from the preceding model. Tonally, early examples are considered to have a \"dark\" tone, while later examples are thought of as having a \"bright\" sound. The bore taper, bow, neck designs, and some mechanical features changed throughout the history of the Mark VI. The changes were not documented by Selmer.  The length of the bow was increased on altos during the 85K serial number range to address certain intonation issues. In subsequent years the short bow was reintroduced. Some altos had baffles soldered into the bow to correct intonation issues.  At least three changes to neck design were made on the tenor during the 1950s and 1960s, and once again in the 1970s. Some contend that the neck design changes account for the different tonal and playing qualities between earlier and later Mark VIs. Others contend that Mark VIs produced after about SN 180,000 had harder metal as a result of a change in the metalworking process, however, that SN corresponds to a known change in neck design so differing characteristics before and after can not definitely be ascribed to metallurgy. Latter-year Mark VIs gained a reputation of being lower quality than early versions (possibly due to Selmer's higher annual production output of the popular saxophone), leading to a greater demand of early-year Mark VIs with a five-digit serial number.  An employee's description of the assembly and quality control process at Selmer USA during the 1960s indicated that different quality Mark VIs were sold through different channels; the top tier was offered to musicians under contract to Selmer (\"Selmer Artists\"), the second tier went to pro dealers in major markets, and the third tier went to the general market. Hence, the best assurance of the quality of a Mark VI may be its sale history, as more variability could be expected in the quality of horns initially sold in the general market. The high F key was offered as an option, though some players believe that instruments without the high F key have better natural intonation. During the mid-1960s optional keywork was offered, including the rare 'Concert' model with a high F#, right hand G#, D to E flat trill key and C to D trill key using the E flat palm key. There are also somewhat rare low A alto and baritone models. The low A baritone is especially sought after, whereas the low A alto model acquired a reputation, rightly or wrongly, for intonation issues. Nonetheless, Ornette Coleman played a low A alto. The quality and ergonomics of the keywork design of the Mark VI can be observed in current saxophone designs: most modern saxophones have keywork that is based upon the basic Mark VI design. Selmer's General Manager Jerome Selmer has confirmed that all Mark VIs were manufactured from industry-standard 66/34 \"yellow brass\" stock and that Selmer never recycled shell casings."

Other engine fits that were tried included an example with a Siemens-Halske Sh 14, and one with an Alfa Romeo 110; this latter machine was designated SAI.11.  Another experimental development that did not enter production was a float-equipped SAI.10 Gabbiano (\"Seagull\")."

        "content": "The Toyota LiteAce and TownAce are a line of light commercial and derivative passenger vans produced by the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota. These vehicles originally utilized the cab-over-engine configuration, although since 1996 a semi-cab-over arrangement has featured instead. The LiteAce launched in 1970 as light-duty truck, with commercial and van/wagon body variants added in 1971. In 1976, Toyota released the larger TownAce van/wagon that derived from the LiteAce; a TownAce truck arrived later in 1978. Between 1982 and 1992, the series accommodated the MasterAce Surf\u2014an upscale TownAce passenger wagon. The two model lines existed separately until 1982 when TownAce trucks became rebadged LiteAce trucks\u2014then in 1992 LiteAce vans became rebranded TownAce vans\u2014thus unifying the once separate vehicle lines. In Japan, the LiteAce retailed at Toyota Auto Store dealerships, with the TownAce sold at Toyota Corolla Store dealerships. The LiteAce and TownAce have been commonly exported to Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the years, select LiteAce/TownAce models have also been available with Daihatsu Delta badging in Japan. Originally sold as the Delta 750 based on the LiteAce truck, later versions have been badged Delta Wide and based on the TownAce van. For the final Delta retailed between 1996 and 2001, the \"Wide\" suffix disappeared. The LiteAce followed the introduction of the more compact MiniAce and larger HiAce in 1967, acting as an intermediacy between these two models in size and carrying capacity. By the mid-1970s, the MiniAce had been retired and the HiAce had grown, thus creating a void in the market resumed by the TownAce. The \"Ace\" moniker references the Toyota ToyoAce medium-duty truck sold starting 1956. The \"Lite\" in LiteAce refers to its light-duty capability, and the \"Town\" in TownAce alludes to the suitability of the model for urban areas."

It is used as a cheaper and more versatile alternative to the SR-3 \"Vikhr\". The 9A-91 is a gas operated, rotating bolt weapon, which utilizes a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt with 4 lugs. The receiver is made from steel stampings; the forend and pistol grip are made from polymer. The steel buttstock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The charging handle is welded to the right side of bolt carrier on earlier production guns with current production guns having a charging hand that folds up, making the gun more low profile by decreasing the chances of the charging handle snagging onto articles of clothing and equipment. Earlier production models of the 9A-91 featured the safety / fire selector lever at the left side of the receiver, above the trigger guard. Current production models feature the safety / fire selector lever at the right side and a sight mounting rail on the left side of the receiver. This allows the user to attach various scopes and red-dots onto the rail to aid in aiming the weapon. The fire selector allows for semi- and full-automatic fire. The flip-up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 meters range, but the relatively short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet effectively restricts the 9A91 to ranges of about 100 meters.

The class consisted of five ships, all of which survived the war. All of the ships of the class initially were to be built for private companies, but the outset of World War II, the ships were transferred to the United States Maritime Commission and given new names. Later, when allocated to the U.S. Navy, they were renamed again. Often the Chiwawa class is seen as part of the Kennebec class. In some cases the Kennebec class is divided into three classes, the Kennebec class (AO-36 to AO-40, AO-48), the Mattaponi class (AO-41 to AO-44, AO-47) and the Chiwawa class. The first two classes were of the T2 and T2-A designs whereas the Chiwawas were of the T3-S-A1 design, mainly differing in having only a 7,000 shp engine and a top speed of 15.3 knots. Three of the ships \u2014 , , and  \u2014 were decommissioned at the end of the war. The remaining two \u2014  and  \u2014 were in and out of commission until late 1957. Chiwawa (now Lee A. Tregurtha) and Neshanic (now American Victory) are still in commercial service on the Great Lakes.  Enoree Niobrara were both eventually scrapped while Escalante, then known as George MacDonald, sank in 1960."

Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, designed and submitted a novel design to the Air Force, notable for its sleekness, particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage, as well as a novel pilot ejection system. Flight testing of the XF-104s began with the first flight in March 1954, encountering several problems, some of which were resolved; however, performance of the XF-104 proved better than estimates and despite both prototypes being lost through accidents, the USAF ordered 17 service-test/pre-production YF-104As. Production Starfighters proved popular, both with the USAF and internationally, serving with a number of countries, including Jordan, Turkey, and Japan."

The spacecraft was built by Boeing and is based on the BSS-601 bus. It is the second of three GOES satellites to use the BSS-601 bus, after GOES-13, which was launched in May 2006. It was launched by United Launch Alliance aboard a Delta IV-M+(4,2) rocket at 22:51 UTC on 27 June 2009, from Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Upon reaching geostationary orbit, on 7 July, it was redesignated GOES-14. It underwent a 6-month series of post-launch tests before completing its \"check-out\" phase and then was placed into \"orbital storage mode\" or stand-by. Its first full disk image was sent on 27 July 2009 GOES-14 was brought out of storage and began one-minute rapid scans of Tropical Storm Isaac on 24 August 2012. On 24 September 2012, it temporarily assumed the role of GOES-East after GOES-13 experienced technical difficulties. On 1 October 2012, it began moving East at a rate of 0.9\u00b0 per day to an ultimate geosynchronous position of 75\u00b0 West longitude to better cover the Atlantic basin during troubleshooting and repair of GOES-13. GOES-13 was returned to service on 18 October 2012. GOES-14 was used to monitor Hurricane Sandy in parallel with the repaired GOES-13 and was returned to storage again on February 13, 2013. GOES-14 was again reactivated on 23 May 2013 when a tiny meteorite struck GOES-13 and tilted it out of alignment. GOES-14 operated from its storage location for about 3 weeks while operators got GOES-13 back online. GOES-14 was to be powered off and placed into storage on 29 February 2020.

With sixteen gunports on the lower deck on each side (although only fifteen of these ports on each side were routinely provided with 36-livre guns) these were the most effective two-deckers of their era. Their broadside of 1,102 livres equated to 1,190 British pounds weight, over 50% more than the standard British 74-gun ship, and even greater than that of a British 100-gun three-decker. Five ships were ordered from 1787 to 1793, and all were completed during the 1790s; six more were ordered in January 1794 to be built to this design at Toulon, but only three of these were named and laid down. All but one of the eight ships were to be captured or destroyed by the British Navy, and four of these were to enjoy long careers in their new service. The prizes were highly regarded by British sea officers, but they proved costly and time-consuming to maintain. From 1802 a new group (the ) of French 80-gun ships was begun of slightly modified design, of which more than 24 were begun."

Windows Live Mail is designed to run on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, but is also compatible with Windows 8 and Windows 10, even though Microsoft bundles a new email client, named Windows Mail, with the latter. Since around 2013, serious problems with Windows Live Mail 2012 (but not with Windows Live Mail 2011) have been reported on various blog sites (including Microsoft forums). One problem is that deleted emails keep returning day after day. Another development that caused complaints is the Live Mail Sent folder erroneously containing the name of the Sender rather than the Recipient in the To column, while omitting the sender's account name in the  Account column (as the fault only affects that folder, a workaround is to move sent items into a new folder, named - for example - \"Sent 2019\"). Discussions on the forums have provided no clear solutions to these issues. Windows Live Mail moved away from the older Microsoft mail programs, such as Outlook Express, which stored all e-mails comprising a folder (such as the Inbox) in a single .dbx file. In order to provide greater flexibility (and to avoid the problem where corruption of a single .dbx file could delete multiple emails), Windows Live Mail stores each email message as a separate .eml file. Only the folder structure is maintained in a single database file, using the ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) database structure, named Mail.MSMessageStore (which also holds some metadata for each .eml file on the system, so can be a huge file). The program also maintains a backup copy of that file, in the Backup sub-folder, so problems are rare. At a pinch, the Mail.MSMessageStore file can be recreated from the data in the .eml files."

The FZ750 would be the first bike in the Genesis design concept. The bikes were known for their linear power delivery, with a maximum speed around 140\u00a0mph. The engine has a forward-inclined cylinder block which effectively lowers the centre of gravity. This results in a relatively long wheelbase, which hampered it when used for short circuit racing, but lowered the centre of gravity and provided an almost 50/50 weight distribution. What was clear was that Yamaha had considered the engine design as part of the overall package. The FZ750 show-cased Yamaha's design skills."

For 1994 the Ford Mustang underwent its first major redesign in fifteen years, being introduced in November 1993 and launching on December 9, 1993. The design, code named \"SN-95\" by Ford, was based on an updated version of the Fox platform, the final Ford vehicle underpinned with this platform. It featured styling by Bud Magaldi that incorporated some stylistic elements from the classic Mustangs. A convertible returned, but the previous notchback and hatchback bodystyles were discontinued in favor of a single fastback coupe bodystyle. Prior to the redesigned Mustang's launch, a two-seater show car was designed by Darrell Behmer and Bud Magali. Called the Mustang Mach III, it was shown at the 1993 North American International Auto Show in Detroit and hinted at what the new production Mustang would look like. The Mach III featured a supercharged 4.6\u00a0L DOHC V8 with . While this engine was not put into production, it hinted to the future use of Ford's Modular V8 in the Mustang, including the eventual use of a supercharged 4.6\u00a0L V8."

It was based on a version of the Supermarine Baby, the first single-seat flying boat fighter aircraft to be designed and built in the United Kingdom, that first flew in February 1918. Registered as G-EALP, the Sea Lion competed successfully against an Avro 539 to win a place as one of the British entrants. On 10 September, the day of the race, thick fog obscured the route and caused the Sea Lion's pilot Basil Hobbs to make an unscheduled landing on the water. Upon taking off, the aircraft's hull was accidentally ripped. Later on during the race, whilst back on the water, the aircraft inverted and sank as a result of the earlier accident. The contest ended in chaos and the results were annulled. The Sea Lion, damaged beyond repair, was scrapped."

Prior to her military service, she was a luxury ocean liner named SS Washington. Washington was launched in May 1933 by the New York Shipbuilding Company of Camden, New Jersey, and operated as a passenger liner from New York City to Plymouth, England, and Hamburg, Germany. Renamed Mount Vernon 6 June 1941, the liner was acquired by the Navy 16 June 1941 and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard the same day, Captain Donald B. Beary in command. Converted for naval use by Philadelphia Navy Yard, Mount Vernon trained along the east coast while mounting tension in the Far East drew the United States toward participation in World War II. In the fall, the new transport joined a convoy at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and sailed for Cape Town, South Africa. As Mount Vernon steamed toward Cape of Good Hope, word arrived that Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor. A member of the crew reported that the Mount Vernon was at Singapore on 7 December 1941, and ordered out, due to intelligence from the British that an attack was imminent. On that side of the date line 8 December, was the day the war began. This was said to be classified \"Top Secret\" and that the Cape Horn Story was a cover. The Mount Vernon was a fast converted liner and did not travel with convoys, at their slower speeds. The crew feared sub attacks because, they traveled alone and did not zig zag much. A machinist mate on the crew disclosed this in the 1970s. However several reliable accounts including those of the soldiers on board confirm that the Mount Vernon was indeed part of the convoy known as William Sail 12x which sailed from Halifax, via Trinidad, and put in at Cape Town two days after the Pearl Harbor attack. They had been due to sail up the east coast of Africa headed for the conflict in the Middle East. But when Pearl Harbor happened, they changed plans and headed to Singapore. The William Sail 12x convoy was a response to Churchill's request to Roosevelt for help, and it is interesting that the troop carrying ships that made up the convoy, such as the USS Mount Vernon (AP-22) and USS West Point, were already converted from their civilian roles as passenger liners in advance of the Pearl Harbor attacks."

The .31 caliber carried over into Samuel Colt's second venture in the arms trade in the form of the \"Baby Dragoon\"-a small revolver developed in 1847\u201348. The \"Baby Dragoon\" was in parallel development with Colt's other revolvers and, by 1850, it had evolved into the \"Colt's Revolving Pocket Pistol\" that collectors now name \"The Pocket Model of 1849\". It is a smaller brother of the more famous \"Colt's Revolving Belt Pistol of Naval Caliber\" introduced the same year and commonly designated by collectors as the \"1851 Navy Model\" (and which was a basically a larger, .36 caliber of the Pocket Model, \"belt pistol\" referring to a weapon sized to fit into a belt holster, as opposed to the saddle holsters generally called for by Colt's larger cavalry combat models).

She was the twentieth locomotive built by railway engineers the Stephensons, being constructed immediately after Rocket. Invicta marked the end of the first phase of locomotive design, which had started with Richard Trevithick's Coalbrookdale locomotive of 1802. Invicta hauled its first train on the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway on 30 May 1830, which was also the first steam-powered passenger service on the railway. Invicta remained in active service until 1839, when stationary engines were introduced to pull trains. Following a failed attempt to sell the locomotive, she was placed in storage. The stored \u2018\u2019Invicta\u2019\u2019 became the property of the South Eastern Railway during the 1840s, and was moved to Ashford Works, becoming the first locomotive in the world to be preserved. Invicta was put on display and  appeared at various events in the UK and abroad. She was restored in 1892, and in 1906, Invicta was presented to the city of Canterbury by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. For 70 years, Invicta was on static display in Canterbury. In 1977, a full cosmetic restoration of the locomotive was undertaken with help from the National Railway Museum. Presently, Invicta is owned by the Transport Trust. During November 2008, it was announced that a \u00a341,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant had been made to Canterbury City Council to develop a new museum at Whitstable to house Invicta. The extension was completed in 2019, and Invicta was lifted in to its new home on 16 June 2019."

Over the years the model received numerous updates and restyles, the dates and specifications of which vary between different markets. Notable changes include the appearance of a single shock absorber rear swingarm in 1977, which Yamaha referred to as Mono-cross, or MX for short, a feature that appeared on many of Yamaha's other small and medium-sized motorcycles at a similar time. In 1982 the DT125 received a major restyle and gained a liquid cooled engine to become the DT125LC.

Other comparable class cameras use 1/3\" sensors and pixel shifting or other schemes to simulate resolution. The PMW-EX1 utilizes Sony's three 1/2-inch type \"Exmor\" CMOS sensors, each with an effective pixel count of 1920 x 1080. Coupled with signal processing LSI, the PMW-EX1 produces images in 1080p (30 and 24 frame/s), 720p (up to 60 frame/s) and 1080i (up to 60 frame/s) HD. The Sony EX1 records internally to SxS (S by S) cards and does not internally record to tape (an external tape device would be required).   The SxS-1 card was introduced in December 2009 as a more affordable option with a shorter operational life than SxS Pro cards. Development of the ExpressCard adapters such as MxR, MxM and KxT have allowed for the use of selected consumer-level SDHC cards at standard frame rates and 720p rates up to 42 frame/s. For 4:2:2 color, an external recording device would be required to be used utilizing the EX1's HD-SDI out."

It was designed in 1919 by Frank Barnwell as a high-speed testbed for the Jupiter engine being developed in Bristol by Roy Fedden for the Cosmos Engineering company, and also to publicise the company's name by participating in air races. The Bullet was a  conventional single-seat biplane with single-bay wings of thin low-drag section braced by N struts.  The fuselage was a wooden four-longeron structure faired to a circular section. The finished airframe, fitted with a dummy engine, was exhibited at the Paris Aero Salon in December 1919 but an engine did not become available until June 1920, when the aircraft was first flown, piloted by Cyril Uwins. It was entered in the Aerial Derby in July  of that year;  its performance in the race was disappointing, and it was substantially modified, with a new cowling, a large hemispherical spinner, and wings of greatly reduced span and gap.  By the time the modifications were complete Cosmos had gone bankrupt and the aero-engine business had been bought by Bristol, and the Bullet was used for the task of accumulating the necessary flight hours  for the Jupiter to gain Air Ministry type approval, a job it shared with the Bristol Badger. The  modified Bullet's  maximum speed was increased to , and it finished fourth in the 1921 Aerial Derby at an average speed of 141\u00a0mph (227\u00a0km/h). A more powerful 380\u00a0hp (280\u00a0kW) Jupiter II engine was fitted, and, piloted by Rollo A. de Haga Haig, came second in the 1922 Aerial Derby, at an average speed of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), beaten only by the Gloster Mars (which had also won the 1921 race It was entered for the 1923 Aerial Derby and Kings Cup races, but following the death of Leslie Foot, the intended pilot,  flying the Bristol M.1D in the Grosvenor Cup race, Bristol withdrew from racing and the Bullet was retired, and eventually scrapped in 1924."

It was revived and rebuilt by Sacramento General Shops into a \"camera car\" for the purpose of shooting motion picture background plates for a ground-based full-motion locomotive training simulator. As camera car number 8799, it was retired in 1984 and donated to the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, California. It was de-accessioned by CSRM and acquired by the Pacific Locomotive Association and moved to the Niles Canyon Railway's Brightside, California rail yard in the summer of 2008.  At the date of its inception, its type represented the highest-horsepower six-axle diesel locomotives in the world.

It was closely related to the Lotus model Mark VIII (1954), of which only about seven cars were made. These cars were largely based on the innovative space frame of the Lotus Mark VI (1952).  The highly aerodynamic bodies were designed by Frank Costin and constructed by Williams & Pritchard Limited. During this early era, of 1954\u20131955, Lotus Engineering was still a fledgling company, and cars were delivered in different states of completion on special orders.  Similar to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was available in various configurations and different engines, including the 1500\u00a0cc MG, 1500\u00a0cc Connaught and 2-litre Bristol were fitted. However, the Mark IX designation is most often powered by the 1100\u00a0cc Coventry Climax engine. Apparently two models of Mark IX were offered \u2013 the \"Club\" and the \"Le Mans\", the latter of which had larger drum brakes fitted. The chassis of the Mark IX was a new design, compared to that of the Mark VIII. Both were space frames of welded steel tube. The new chassis was an advance over the Mark VIII in terms of the efficiency of its design and avoiding the VIII's need for diaphragm-stiffening panels. However, both chassis still used an oversized lower rail of  tube, a hang-over from the original design of the first Mark VI space frame. Compared to the Mark VIII, the Mark IX was shortened somewhat to a wheelbase of , and the body itself was about  shorter than that of the Mark VIII. A total of about thirty of the Mark IX sports racing cars were produced in various forms, and these were successfully raced in both Europe and the US. The first two examples of the Mark IX were apparently delivered to the US with the 1100\u00a0cc Coventry Climax engine to compete in the 1955 running of the 12 Hours of Sebring race and were beaten by a Porsche Spyder.  These cars were actually entered as Lotus Mark VIII models in the G class by Frank Miller of Larchmont, NY and by Bobby Burns and Norman J. Scott of Houston TX in, respectively, car numbers 78 and 79. The Lotus Works Team entered at least one Mark IX in the Le Mans 24 hour race in 1955, driven by Chapman, which may have been equipped with disc brakes. However, the car was disqualified apparently due to his reversing the car to re-enter the race track after going off course."

The class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs. The design of the boats was based upon John Philip Holland's submarine design and featured a single, teardrop hull, which resembled the design of modern nuclear submarines. The class members were just over  long and displaced  surfaced and  submerged. All were originally equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes. The first two boats, U-5 and U-6, built specifically for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, to the same design as the United States C-class submarine were partially constructed in the United States and completed at Whitehead & Co. at Fiume. The third was completely constructed by Whitehead's at Fiume and purchased by Austria-Hungary to bolster their U-boat fleet after the outbreak of World War I. All three boats had successes during World War I; between them they sank five ships with a combined tonnage of 22,391. In addition they captured seven ships as prizes and damaged , a French dreadnought of 22,189 tons displacement. All three boats were sunk during the war, though U-5, the lead boat of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, U-5, the only survivor of the class, was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and was broken up in 1920."

Teacher's states that it uses \"fully smoked peated single malt whisky from The Ardmore distillery as its fingerprint whisky\" along with about 30 other single malt whiskies. Most of the output of the Ardmore distillery is used to produce the Teacher's brand."

Radetzky was built by the shipbuilding company Stabilimento Tecnico in Trieste and commissioned into the fleet on 15 January 1911. The ship conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean before the outbreak of World War I in mid-1914. During the war, Radetzky operated largely as part of a fleet in being alongside the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy; in doing so, the ships tied down considerable naval forces from the Triple Entente. Radetzky did participate in some offensive operations, primarily shore bombardments in the Adriatic Sea against French, Montenegrin, and Italian targets. Towards the end of 1918, with the war going against the Austrians, Radetzky was prepared to be transferred to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 10 November 1918 \u2014 six days after the Austrian armistice \u2014 Yugoslav navy officers sailed the battleship out of Pola and surrendered it to a squadron of American submarine chasers. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the transfer was not recognized; instead, Radetzky was given to Italy and broken up for scrap."

It was powered by a U880 processor (a Z80 clone) and sold together with a membrane (flat foil) keyboard. Initially, the kit was equipped with 16-KByte DRAM, which was later replaced by a 64-KByte version. The kits first became available for sale in 1985 and were distributed in a unique way at the time. To purchase, buyers had to send a postcard to the Robotron shop in Erfurt and wait six to 12 months to pick the kits up personally. The package contained the assembled and tested motherboard, a membrane keyboard, various small parts and detailed technical documentation. This basic kit was shipped without a power supply or casing for the PCB. Most users tended to program the kit using the BASIC interpreter, which was loadable from a compact cassette or by using a ROM cartridge. The BASIC interpreter contained a common core binary, which was identical across home computer models. So the programs were widely compatible among different models of GDR-manufactured computers despite differences in capabilities. Robotron was also the manufacturer of another line of computers, the Z9001, KC85/1 and KC87, which shared some of the same expansion modules \u2013 offering more options also for Z1013. The system bus connector was based on the K1520 standard for 8-bit computers in the GDR. This conformity to one standard across computers, ranging from tank-sized mini computers to small home computers, allowed the reuse of hardware from minicomputers with the same bus interface. This meant that most of the hardware and binary code from one platform could be used across very different platforms and allowed the sharing of resources. This groundbreaking standardization was due to the need for common standards and compatibility between computer users in the Eastern Bloc. Opinion is divided over the widespread use and popularity of the MRB Z1013 in the GDR. With a total of 25,000 kits sold over its lifetime (from 1985 to mid-1990), it fared well in comparison to other models. However, some analysts put this success down to the relative ease of access to the kits compared to other computer offerings. After all, the key point for the success was the simplistic makeup down to a bare minimum. It is still debatable if it repelled potential users or actually lead to a higher productions volume. Either which way, demand and production kept a kind of balance. To this extent, it was the only computer freely available for private purchase."

In 1961 Case Hough, the president of Daisy Heddon division of Victor Comptometer, purchased the design of a new firearm system.  The new system was developed by a Belgian Chemist named Jules Van Langenhover.  The new gun would be known as the Daisy V/L rifle. The V/L ammunition consisted of a .22 caliber bullet with a small cylinder of propellant on the back, and no primer. The rifle resembled a typical spring-air rifle, but the 2000\u00b0 hot, high pressure air served not only to propel the projectile but also to ignite the propellant on the back of the V/L cartridge. The rifle uses a small, unique and well designed part called an Obturator (obturator/ignitor) to compress the air as it is pushed through a tiny hole. This air is heated as it is pushed through the small hole enough to ignite the powder of the caseless round. The V/L guns and ammunition were discontinued in 1969 after the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled that they constituted a firearm, and Daisy, which was not licensed to manufacture firearms, decided to discontinue manufacture rather than become a firearms manufacturer. About 23,000 of the rifles were made before production ceased. The V/L has been added to the ATF Curio & Relic list."

The DP series are therefore targeted against professional photographers or enthusiasts seeking a compact, yet capable camera. It was announced in September 2008, and began shipping in 2009. Differences to the DP1 include a lens that is one stop faster, f/2.8 vs. f/4.0, 24.2 vs. 16.6mm(35mm equivalent of 41mm vs 28mm) and a faster processing chip, the True II image processor, which is shared with the Sigma SD15 DSLR. Though claimed difficult to use, it shares many features and limitations found in rangefinder cameras such as the Leica M6, and with its mechanical-feedback manual focus, snaps images with zero shutter lag. In February 2010, Sigma released an updated version of the camera, the Sigma DP2s. The DP2s offers a new AF algorithm, a \"power save\" mode and a modified rear design with new labeling of the buttons. The imaging sensor itself remained the same. In 2012, Sigma released the 'Merrill' range of the DP series, with a much improved sensor."

However, three further special editions of the Aura R1 were released through 2009: Aura Diamoniqe Edition, Aura Celestial Edition and Aura Diamond Edition. Aura used to be a luxury device with US$2000 price tag. It was made from premium materials such as stainless steel and sapphire to appeal large audience and comes inside a wooden box. The phone featured a unique high-resolution circular display with 300dpi and an adapted circular user interfaced based on Motorola's MotoMagx operating system. One of the main selling points of the device apart from its screen was its swivel-like opening mechanism. Motorola tried to replicate the success of Razr V3 series by making a new innovative phone. The screen's opening mechanism was made possible thanks to its Swiss-made gears composed of Rockwell 50-55 hardened steel and 130 precision ball bearings. Its custom-engineered rotating mechanism is composed of more than 200 high-precision individual parts, and the gears are protected against harsh conditions with the same coatings used in high-performance racing engines. The screen of the AURA was able to display 26 Million different colours, all these things made it one of a kind phone, which never really took off."

It was first bottled and marketed in 1870 by the former pharmaceutical salesman turned bourbon-merchant George Garvin Brown \u2013 the founder of the Brown\u2013Forman Corporation (whose descendants still manage the company). During the Prohibition period from 1920 to 1933, Brown-Forman received one of only six licenses authorizing lawful production (for medicinal purposes). Old Forester is produced under the supervision of Master Distiller Chris Morris (as of 2006) at the Brown\u2013Forman distillery in Shively, Kentucky, (which is located directly adjacent to the pre-merger Southwest boundary of  Louisville) and at Old Forester Distilling Co.

The name came from the claim that it produced 85\u00a0bhp, although rear wheel measurements were in the low 70s. It featured the first factory 16-inch front wheel (at least in the U.S.), previously seen only on race bikes. It also had low clip-on handlebars, rearset foot pegs, four-into-one exhaust, electronic fuel injection, and a monoshock rear suspension called the Suzuki Full Floater\u2014the first to feature this. Its styling was derived from the Suzuki Katana. The engine was rather tame, with boost kicking in around 5,000 rpm. The fuel-injected motor pulled strongly from that point but did not match the performance of larger sportbikes. Oil jets directed onto the bottom of the pistons improved engine cooling. Later iterations of this technique were marketed as the Suzuki Advanced Cooling System. While the XN did not have the power of other sportbikes, it had notably better handling than similar powered machines due to frame and suspension geometry. Total XN85 production was 1,153 units from 1983 to 1985. Three hundred of those were exported to the U.S, where the bike was sold only in 1983. The XN85 was replaced shortly after its release in the U.S. by the lighter and cheaper GS750ES. Motorcycle.Com stated many years later \"An epic failure, the Katana-styled bike was the most unreliable and poorly selling turbo bike from the Japanese manufacturers\""

Each coprocessor includes a tamper-responding hardware security module (HSM) that provides secure storage for storing master keys and other sensitive data. The HSM has been certified to meet FIPS 140-2 Level 4 security requirements. The coprocessor is supported on all IBM server platforms including System z (mainframe), System i, System p, and System x (Linux or Microsoft Windows). On System z, it is called the \"Crypto Express2\". Applications may include financial PIN transactions, bank-to-clearing-house transactions, EMV transactions for integrated circuit (chip) based credit cards, and general-purpose cryptographic applications using symmetric key algorithms, hashing algorithms, and public key algorithms. The operational keys (symmetric or RSA private) are generated in the coprocessor and are then saved either in a keystore file or in application memory, encrypted under the master key of that coprocessor. Any coprocessor with an identical master key can use those keys. As of June 2005, the IBM 4764 superseded the IBM 4758 that was discontinued. At the end of December 2011, the IBM 4764 was discontinued. The successor to the 4764 was introduced on each of the IBM server platforms between 2009 and 2011: November 2009 for the System z (mainframe), where it is called the Crypto Express3 April 2010 for POWER systems, where it is available as feature codes 4807, 4808, and 4809 May 2011 for System x (PC) servers, where it is called the 4765"

It has unconventional features with a cruiser-style  air-cooled, overhead valve V-twin engine  but sportbike or naked bike style frame and suspension.  The engine is derived from the Yamaha Warrior XV1700 and modified to suit application in the MT-01, while the forks and brakes are derived from the 2004 to 2005 Yamaha R1. Originally unveiled as a concept motorcycle at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show, strong public interest in the machine led Yamaha to develop a production model, which was released in 2005. The Motorcycle Design Association (MDA) awarded the MT-01 the Open Category award at the 2004 annual Motorcycle Design Awards at INTERMOT. During its production, the MT-01 remained largely unchanged. Yamaha offered three different tuning kits developed with Akrapovi\u010d (named Stage 1, 2, and 3) for the MT-01, which provide performance increases from standard at each stage. Stage 1: Two Akrapovi\u010d mufflers, heat shields, and solo seat kit, street-legal. Stage 2: Full Akrapovi\u010d exhaust system, heat shields, solo seat kit, and Stage 2 high performance ECU, track-use only. Stage 3: As above, and a velocity stack kit, valve spring set, stronger diaphragm clutch spring, gasket kit, high compression piston kit, high performance camshaft, and high performance ECU, track-use only.

The product was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012, and generally to retail on October 26, 2012. Windows 8 was made available for download via MSDN and TechNet. Windows 8 is the first version of Windows to support the ARM architecture, under the Windows RT branding. Microsoft released Windows 8.1 in October 2013, addressing some aspects of Windows 8 that were criticized by reviewers and early adopters and incorporated additional improvements to various aspects of the operating system. Windows 8 was ultimately succeeded by Windows 10 in July 2015. Support for IE10 on Windows Server 2012 and Windows Embedded 8 Standard ended on January 31, 2020. Market share had fallen to 1.06% by October 2020. Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform and user interface intended to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows was now competing with mobile operating systems, including Android and iOS. In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's Metro design language and the Start screen, a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on touchscreen input, integration with online services, and Windows Store, an online distribution for downloading and purchasing new software, and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots. Many of these features were adopted from Windows Phone. Windows 8 added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format hard drives, near field communications, and cloud computing. Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering service and support for UEFI Secure Boot on supported devices. Windows 8 was released to a mixed critical reception. Although reaction towards its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface of the operating system was widely criticized for being potentially confusing and difficult to learn, especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen. Despite these shortcomings, 60 million Windows 8 licenses were sold through January 2013, a number that included both upgrades and sales to OEMs for new PCs. In August 2019, computer experts reported that the BlueKeep security vulnerability, , that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing for the possibility of remote code execution, may now include related flaws, collectively named DejaBlue, affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., Windows 7 and all recent versions). In addition, experts reported a Microsoft security vulnerability, , based on legacy code involving ctfmon.exe that affects all Windows versions from the older Windows XP version to the most recent Windows 10 versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available."

        "content": "The Audi R8 V12 TDI (later renamed the Audi R8 TDI Le Mans), was a diesel engined concept car that was first presented to the public at the 2008 North American International Auto Show on 13 January and then the Geneva Motor Show in March in the same year. The car was fitted with a 6.0-litre V12 engine, utilising Volkswagen Group's long-established Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbodiesel technology. This engine produces  at 4,000 rpm and  of torque at 1,750-3,000 rpm. The car utilises Audi's quattro permanent four-wheel drive system and a 6-speed manual transmission. The car can accelerate from  in 4.2\u00a0seconds, and can reach a top speed of over 300\u00a0km/h (186\u00a0mph). The R8 TDI Le Mans has modified suspension settings and brakes to cope with the additional power and weight (), resulting from replacing the standard V8 engine with the V12 TDI. The V12 TDI requires more cooling than the standard R8, hence a NACA duct is incorporated in the roof to feed additional air into the engine. The vents on the front and back of the car have also been increased by 20% in size. The car all-LED headlamps which were first seen on the Audi Le Mans Quattro concept. For its appearance at the Detroit Motor Show, Audi fitted 20\u00a0inch alloy wheels.  The rear bulkhead has been moved forward in order to accommodate the physically larger V12 engine, meaning it loses the space behind the rear seats usually found on the standard R8. In May 2009, Audi decided to halt plans for possible production of the R8 TDI, citing \"the cost of re-engineering the petrol R8 to accommodate the massive twin-turbocharged diesel engine is simply too great \u2013 and that it would be unable to recoup its investment through sales alone\"."

It stores two or more bits of information per cell rather than just one, in an architecture called multi-level cell (MLC). This is accomplished by storing intermediate voltage levels instead of using only the two levels (discharged = \"0\" and charged = \"1\") of traditional binary memories. The StrataFlash technology evolved out of Intel's ETOX flash memory products. Two bits per cell are achieved with four levels of voltage, while three bits per cell can be achieved with eight levels. Research of this technology began in 1992 and the first commercial products were released in 1997. Further developments allowed faster read speeds by offering synchronous burst mode and asynchronous page mode read operations."

        "content": "The FN Model 30-11 is a Belgian bolt-action sniper rifle, manufactured between 1976 and 1986. The origins of the development of many modern military and law enforcement sniper ri\ufb02es can be traced back to the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. The XXth games of the Olympiad will always be remembered as the Munich Massacre where Palestinian members of the terrorist group Black September took Israeli athletes hostage. The situation on the ground favored the terrorists. Although the Israeli government refused to negotiate, the Germans met the terrorists\u2019 demands to be airlifted with the hostages from the Olympic village to a nearby airport. The lasting hostage situation came to an end at night at a Munich airport where the German military opened \ufb01re on the terrorists. Realizing that they were trapped, terrorists executed all hostages before a gun battle ensued. News reports of the day made mention of German sharpshooters engaging the terrorists. In actuality these were nothing more than of\ufb01cers with standard military G3 rifles without any optics. The concept of sniper teams with dedicated sniper equipment was alien to law enforcement forces at the time. This was also known by the terrorists who callously exposed themselves in the Olympic village armed with Madsen sub machine guns. The operations at the airport and the lack of security at the Olympic village came under worldwide criticism. German officials tried to de\ufb02ect the blame by pointing out that Israel had refused negotiations but the damage was done. The Munich tragedy became the catalyst for the formation of specialized anti\u2014terrorism law enforcement units including sniper units. Already at the time Germany was plagued by terrorist groups and their in\ufb02uence would only spread throughout western Europe. From the 19703 up to the 19905, groups\u201c) such as the Rote Armee Fraktion (Red Army Faction), Black September, Abu Nidal, Action Directe, CCC (Cellules Communistes Combattantes \u2014 Communist Combatant Cells), ETA (Euskado Ta Askatasuna), Hezbollah, IRA (Irish Republican Army), PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization), Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Brigate Rosse (Red Brigades), and 17 November, operated in western Europe\u201c). Most of these groups were based on either communist or radical Islamic ideologies. At the time of the Munich Massacre, only two bolt\u2014action sniper ri\ufb02es were manufactured in western Europe: the French FR-Fl (Fusil a Repetition, modele F1) in 7.5x54mm was introduced in 1964 and the Austrian Steyr Mannlicher SSG\u201469 (scharfschutzengewehr \u2014 sharpshooter\u2019s ri\ufb02e) in 7.62x51mm was introduced in 1969. From these two, the Steyr SSG-69 was at the time the industry standard. This was not necessarily a re\ufb02ection of superior quality but rather that Steyr was a commercial product while the French ri\ufb02e was arsenal produced primarily for French forces. The French 7.5x54mm caliber was a demerit of the ri\ufb02e as the French did not adhere to the 7.62x51mm NATO standard. Although there was a need for specialized sniper ri\ufb02es, manufacturers were reluctant to pursue this market. Development, production, and labor costs were high with only a potentially small sales yield."

It is one of twelve similar locomotives built for the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (D&RG) by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1883. It was built as a passenger locomotive, with  drivers, the largest drivers used on any three foot gauge D&RGW locomotive. The large drivers made it suitable for relatively fast passenger service. Various photographs show 168 during its working life. One shows it in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River in 1904. Another shows it in Montrose, Colorado, west of Gunnison, at the head of a special train taking President William Howard Taft to the opening of the Gunnison Tunnel which, at the time, was the longest irrigation tunnel in the world. There are also photographs, taken by Otto Perry, showing it in Alamosa in 1923 and Salida in 1929. It was retired in 1938 after a service life of 55 years. The railroad gave it to the City of Colorado Springs on August 1, 1938. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Rio Grande Engine No. 168 in 1979. Although it sat in Antlers Park, unprotected from the elements, behind a low fence, for so many years, it appeared to be in immaculate cosmetic condition when removed for restoration to operating condition in early 2016. The city has entered into an agreement with the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad (C&TSRR) to have the engine restored to working order. The locomotive is now located in Antonito, Colorado. Restoration was completed in October 2019. The restoration project was headed up by Cumbres and Toltec Special Projects department and lead by Assistant General Manager Efstathios Papas. The project cost $508,000 and took 27 months to complete. The railroad intends to use this engine frequently and put it into normal service as much as possible."

Many arrangements from the Type 81 and the next two types were also seen on the World War II Type IX U-boats when their design work took place 20 years later. Compared to the previous type 63, the 81s were  longer, while the pressure hull remained the same. They were  faster on the surface, and  faster submerged and increased range by  to 11,200\u00a0 nmi at 8 knots. They carried 12 torpedoes instead of 6, and by 1917 all type 87s had the larger 10.5\u00a0cm deck gun versus the twin 8.8\u00a0cm on the 63s. Crew size was decreased by 1 to 35. Compared to the following type 87, the 81s were  longer, yet 5 tons lighter. Their range was 180 miles shorter, but speed was  faster on the surface and  faster submerged. The most significant difference was the addition of 4 more torpedoes and 2 additional bow tubes on the type 87. Type 87 also got the additional crew member back and numbered 36 again. Type 81 boats were responsible for sinking 3.537% of all allied shipping sunk during the war, taking a total of 427,247 combined tons.

Popular cameras of this type at that time were mainly from Europe but a few from Japan, including the Asahi Pentax, the Miranda T and the Topcon R. The miniature SLR camera concept was conceived in the 1930s at Ihagee in Dresden, resulting in the 1936 Kine Exakta. Influential cameras designs like that of the 1939 KW Praktiflex, the 1949 ZI Contax S, and 1952 the KW Praktina marked the steady progress toward a perfected SLR. Several features of the latter seem to have influenced the design of the SR-2 although dissimilar in many respects. The obvious similarities are the stepped top plate, the carrying strap lugs, the self-timer lever and some general body features. The name Minolta was first used in 1932 on the 4.5\u00d76 format Semi-Minolta using 120 film. The manufacturer was established in November 1928 by  (1899-1985) as the Nichidoku Shashinki Sh\u014dten (Japan-German Camera Store) together with two Germans living in Japan, but reorganised as a joint stock company named the Molta Goshi Kaisha in the summer of 1931. It is likely that this inspired the name Minolta that later became a registered trade mark. However, in 1937 the company was reorganised as the Chiyoda Kogaku Seik\u014d KK, CHIYOKO for short. Chiyoda Kogaku manufactured leaf shutters and photographic lenses, as well as melting their own optical glasses, an achievement very few camera makers ever have matched. In 1947, the Minolta-35 was launched as the company's first 35mm camera, resulting in a brief range of quite popular rangefinder models lasting until the end of the 1950s. In 1962 the company name was changed to  Minolta Camera K.K."

The first fully capable military submarine, she was launched 8 September 1888. She had one torpedo tube (and two torpedoes) and an air regeneration system. Her hull shape, propeller, periscope, torpedo launcher and cruciform external controls anticipated later designs.  Her underwater speed was . With fully charged batteries, she was the fastest submarine yet built, with underwater performance levels (except for range) that matched those of First World War U-boats for a very short period, before her batteries began to drain. For example, the , a pre-war German U-boat built in 1908, had an underwater speed of 8.1kn, and an underwater range of  at 5.8kn, before having to resurface to recharge her batteries. Although advanced in many ways, Peral lacked a means of charging batteries while underway, such as an internal combustion engine, thus had a very limited endurance and range. In June 1890, Peral's submarine launched a torpedo while submerged. It was also the first submarine to incorporate a fully reliable underwater navigation system. However, conservatives in the Spanish naval hierarchy terminated the project despite two years of successful tests. Her operational abilities have led some to call her the first U-boat. Peral was withdrawn from service in 1890 and is now preserved at the Cartagena Naval Museum."

The R suffix denotes a racing version, however the CB1100R was a road-legal machine produced by Honda and offered for sale to the public.  It was produced only in numbers sufficient to meet the homologation requirements for the R to be classed as a production motorcycle in markets into which it was sold. It was Honda's first 'homologation special' and was raced in the production class racing in most major markets: including Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It was not sold in the US. In 1981 the CB1100R won the New Zealand Castrol Six Hour ridden by Australian pair of Malcolm Campbell and Mick Cole.  The CB1100R won the premier Australian production race in 1982, the Castrol Six Hour in the hands of future 1987 500cc GP World Champion Wayne Gardner and teammate Wayne Clark. Other CB1100Rs finished the race 2nd, 3rd and 4th, with 6 CB11000Rs finishing in the top 8 spots. The Australasian success of the CB1100R lead directly to the development of the Suzuki GSX1100SXZ Katana homologation racing specials. The model designations are CB1100RB (1981), CB1100RC (1982), and CB1100RD (1983). In 1981, 1050 units were sold, followed by 1500 per year in 1982 and 1983. The 1981 'RB' was half faired with a solo seat only. The 82 and 83 models have different bodywork including a full fairing, aluminium fuel tank, and pillion seat covered with a removable seat cowl. The 82 (RC) and 83 (RD) (pictured) were largely similar in appearance, yet with considerable differences what concerns the full fairing and dashboard layout. None of the faring parts of any of the 3 models are interchangeable with one another ! The RC fairing, fairing bracket and dashboard combo was only made for the RC and  does not interchange in any way with the RD, which had a slightly shorter overall length. Other differences include the paint scheme, rear swing arm design and color and front fork design. In 1983 the Honda CB1100F was launched that essentially was a blend of the CB1100R and the CB900F, for a broader market. The 1981 CB1100RB had a claimed  @ 9000 rpm."

        "content": "Barry Railway Class B1 were 0-6-2T steam tank locomotives of the Barry Railway in South Wales.  They were designed by J. H. Hosgood and built by Sharp Stewart, & Co., Vulcan Foundry and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Franco-Belge. The locomotive, though similar to the B class, differed in having an increased tank capacity of 1,630 gallons compared with the 1,400 gallons of the B class.  The purpose of this was to enable them to take a train of empty wagons from Cadoxton Yard to Trehafod Junction without the need to refill the tank. Their main duty was to take loaded coal trains from Trehafod Junction, and the pits on the Brecon & Merthyr, to Cadoxton Yard and return either with the empty wagons or occasionally pit props from Barry Docks.  However they could also be seen pulling colliers' trains between Barry and Porth as well as excursion trains from various locations to Barry Island.  In particular 2 B1 class locomotives, nos. 111 and 122, were used to take excursion trains from the Rhymney Railway to Barry for those visiting the National Eisteddfod held there in 1920.  B1s could also be seen pulling the 'Ports Express' from Barry to Newcastle over the Barry Railway section of the journey between Barry and Cardiff. The locomotives passed to the Great Western Railway in 1922 and 20 survived into British Railways ownership in 1948. However, all 20 had been withdrawn by 1952 and none were preserved."

        "content": "The  is a luxury crossover SUV sold since 1998 by Lexus, a luxury division of Toyota. Originally released in its home market of Japan in late 1997 as the Toyota Harrier, export sales began in March 1998 as the Lexus RX. Considered as the first luxury crossover SUV, four generations of the RX have been produced to date, the first being compact in size, and the latter three classified as mid-size. Both front- and four-wheel drive configurations have been used on the RX series, and several gasoline powertrain options, including V6 engines and hybrid systems, have been offered. In the Lexus model lineup, the RX sits below the larger GX and LX (marketed as the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado and the Toyota Land Cruiser body-on-frame SUVs outside North America), and above the smaller NX crossover with a lesser displacement inline-four engine. The name \"RX\" stands for \"Radiant Crossover\". It has also been labelled as \"Recreational Cross Country\" in some markets. The RX's current Toyota counterparts are the Highlander/Kluger; past counterparts were the Harrier and Venza. The first-generation RX 300, fitted with a 3.0-liter V6 engine, began sales in 1998. The Japanese market Harrier released in 1997 also offered a 2.2-liter inline-four, later uprated to 2.4\u00a0liters. The second-generation RX 300 (3.0-liter V6) and RX 330 (3.3-liter V6) models went on sale in 2003, with both variants supplanted by the more powerful RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) in 2006. Like the previous series, a 2.4-liter inline-four engine was sold alongside the 3.0-liter V6 in the Japanese market Harrier. In 2005, a hybridized gasoline-electric version of the 3.3-liter second-generation model was made available as the RX 400h in export markets and as the Harrier Hybrid in Japan. For the third generation released in 2009, both RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) and RX 450h (3.5-liter V6 hybrid) models were initially offered, with an entry-level RX 270 (2.7-liter inline-four) offered by Lexus in some Asian markets, including in Japan, since 2010. Since the release of the third generation, Japanese sales have occurred under the RX name as opposed to Harrier as had been the case previously. In the fourth generation, a turbocharged (2.0-liter inline-four) RX 200t/300 model was introduced to replace the previous 2.7-liter unit. The RX has been assembled at Toyota Motor Kyushu since launch. The RX and RX Hybrid were the first Lexus models to be built outside Japan, with North American market versions produced at the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada plant in Cambridge, Ontario beginning 2003 (RX) and expanded in 2014 (RX Hybrid). Hybrid transaxles are built at the Kokura plant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka since 2009."

After her commissioning, Augsburg spent her peacetime career first as a torpedo test ship and then as a gunnery training ship. After the outbreak of World War I, she was assigned to the Baltic Sea, where she spent the entire war. On 2 August 1914, she participated in an operation that saw the first shots of the war with Russia fired, and she later took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 and Operation Albion in October 1917, as well as numerous smaller engagements throughout the war. She struck a mine, once, in January 1915, though the ship was again operational in a few months. After the end of the war, Augsburg was ceded to Japan as a war prize, and was subsequently broken up for scrap in 1922."

The general look of the new car was very similar to that of the Italian built Alfetta sedan, designed by Giuseppe Scarnati and first offered in Europe in 1972, although the Brazilian car was actually 41 centimetres (16\u00a0in) longer and 7 centimetres (2.8\u00a0in) wider than the Alfetta. Under the skin, the 2300 was based technically on the older Alfa Romeo 1900. The gear box of the 2300 was conventionally located adjacent to the engine and not (as with the Alfetta) across the rear axle. Like its Brazilian predecessor, the FNM 2000, the 2300 featured a four-cylinder twin camshaft engine, now of 2,310\u00a0cc with a claimed output of 140\u00a0hp (100\u00a0kW). A maximum speed of 170\u00a0km/h (106\u00a0mph) was claimed. In the 1985 model year leaflet the 2300 was called as \"Alfa Romeo 85\". This model was supposedly manufactured until November 1986, although a final 243 Alfa Romeos were built in Brazil in 1987. As demand for ethanol-powered cars rose, a stockpile of petrol-powered 2300s built up: as a result, Alfa Romeo forced the Brazilian Alfa Romeo on European (Dutch, Swiss, and German) importers in 1981 under the designation Alfa Romeo 2300 Rio. Around 600 of the cars were shipped to The Netherlands. The cars proved nearly unsellable and severe quality issues further deteriorated Alfa Romeo's image in Central and Northern Europe, with the importers eventually being forced to buy back the majority of the cars brought over. In the Netherlands, the bought back cars were sold on to used car dealers after three years in outdoors storage; without warranties the already decaying cars caused severe damage to Alfa Romeo's already crumbling reputation. The only real value of the Rio seems to have been to provide parts for restorers of vintage Alfa Romeo 1900s."

The distinguishing feature of the Fuji GX680 is the articulating front standard, which runs on a rail connecting lens and camera body by a bellows; the interchangeable lens is permanently mounted to a lens board. In contrast to competing medium-format cameras, e.g. Mamiya RB67 and RZ67 and Rolleiflex SL66, for some models of the Fuji GX680 the front standard can be shifted right, left, up and down for perspective control, and the front standard can also be tilted on horizontal and vertical axes to control depth of field using the Scheimpflug principle. Therefore, the Fuji GX680 has many of the same camera movements of a large format view camera, only limited by restricted motions of the front standard and a fixed rear standard, making the camera also suitable for architectural photography. The Fuji GX680 has quite large physical dimensions for a medium-format camera, but compared to the typical monorail/studio large-format camera, the Fuji GX680 is more compact. Although the Fuji GX680 was designed for studio work due to its size and weight, a neck-strap was offered for mobile work."

Thus equipped, the Type F provided 45\u00a0hp of output. 1933 was a year of continuing economic difficulty for the German economy.   Brennabor's output had continued to slide, from 1,655 units the equivalent of 3.0% of the German passenger car market in 1931, to 522 units, equivalent to a market share of 1.3% in 1932.    By the end of 1933 the company had abandoned automobile production in order to focus on light-weight motor bikes.

It was the manufacturer's first car with a four-cylinder engine.   653 were produced. The V4C3 was propelled using a four-cylinder 1,725\u00a0cm\u00b3 four-stroke engine, mounted ahead of the driver.   This was the first, and till now (2012) the only Peugeot to feature a V4 engine.   A maximum 9\u00a0hp of power was delivered to the rear wheels. The car was the first of several Lion-Peugeot models that became known as a Lion-Peugeot 10\u00a0hp.   This was a reference to the car's fiscal horse power, applying a system of car classification for taxation purposes then being established in France.   Tax horsepower then, and for several decades to come, was defined purely as a function of the combined surface area of the engine's cylinders, this being far easier to assess consistently and accurately than the actual power produced by an engine.   At this stage fiscal horse-power tended to equate approximately to actual horse-power, although the two would diverge subsequently, as engines became more efficient at extracting power from a given sum of cylinder diameters.  Eventually, in the second half of the twentieth century, more complex (and less internationally consistent) definitions of fiscal horse power would replace those defined only by cylinder diameters. The V4C3 shared its 2,250\u00a0mm wheel base with the manufacturer's models from the previous year such as their twin-cylinder Type V2C3.   The 3,200\u00a0mm (approximately) body length provided space for between two and four people depending on the body specified.   The wide range of different body types offered followed a pattern that by now would have been familiar to many Lion-Peugeot buyers.   It included a Phaeton, a Torpedo, a Limousine, a Landaulet, a \u201cTouring Car\u201d, a Coup\u00e9, a delivery van and a sports car."

        "content": "The Delahaye VLR was a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle clearly inspired by the Jeep and first presented, after an unusually long gestation, by Delahaye during the Summer of 1950.   At a time when the luxury car market had been driven into freefall by a combination of government taxation policy and the depressed state of the postwar economy, the VLR was critical in keeping alive the company that produced it during the early 1950s. \u201cVLR\u201d stood for \u00ab V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance \u00bb (light reconnaissance vehicle).   The name \u00ab VLRD \u00bb V\u00e9hicule l\u00e9ger de reconnaissance Delahaye\u00bb is also sometimes used. The vehicle featured a light metal ohc four-cylinder water-cooled engine of (initially) 1,995 cc and, by the standards of the time, a sophisticated suspension system.   The four-speed gear box featured synchromesh on all four speeds. During the second half of 1950 the French army tested it extensively and declared themselves impressed.   With only very minor modifications, they homologated the VLR for army use and placed an order for slightly more than 4,000.   The company's postwar production model, the Delahaye 175 had fared disastrously in the marketplace, with just 521 produced between 1947 and 1950, so the military order secured for the VLR was more than welcome. The army were impressed by the performance of the vehicle both on and off-road, and the company was encouraged to try to sell VLRs into the civilian market.   Civilian-market models were hard to distinguish from the military ones, but the 24-volt electrical system upon which  the military had insisted was replaced, in the civilian VLRs, by a more conventional (for the time and vehicle's size) 12-volt electrical system.   The VLR's civil-market price of above one and a half million francs was considered expensive (though much lower than the prices asked for the company's luxury passenger cars), and its mechanical complexity made it an unattractive proposition other than for rich owner-mechanics.   It is worth bearing in mind that in the aftermath of a massive European war there were at this time a large number of second-hand Jeeps competing for the attention of anyone thinking to buy a civilian version of a VRC. Almost all of the 9,621 VLRs sold between 1951 and 1955 were accordingly sold to the military.   Production was halted in March 1954, but vehicles were still being delivered in 1955. It was said that the mechanical complexity of the vehicle, which excited much comment in the press and was blamed for its lack of sales success on the civilian market, was not seen as a problem by the army.   Nevertheless, by the mid-1950s the army had switched to the mechanically simpler Jeep, then being assembled in France by Hotchkiss under Willys license as the Hotchkiss M201. The Delahaye business itself was taken over by Hotchkiss in 1954, after which VLR production seems to have been quickly stopped."

It originally ran on Windows Phone 7.5 \"Mango\" and was Nokia's first device to run the Windows Phone operating system marking the company's shift from Symbian for their smartphones. It was Nokia's flagship upon the original release in Europe in November 2011, and was thus also a highly important product for Nokia's mobile phone business. Lumia 800 shares its design with the previously released MeeGo-based Nokia N9 and it was originally Meego CDMA-variant for Verizon with codename RM-716 Searay. The outward differences are one added physical button dedicated to the camera on the right side of the phone, and a dual LED flash moved directly above the Carl Zeiss camera lens. Despite a similar exterior, the Lumia 800 has a different interior than N9. Lumia 800's chipset comes from Qualcomm, whereas the N9 is based on a Texas Instruments OMAP chipset and CPU. Like the N9, it has a convex-curved Gorilla Glass AMOLED PenTile screen with a ClearBlack antiglare filter. The screen diagonal is 3.7\u00a0inches (800 x 480 pixels), compared with 3.9\u00a0inches (854 x 480 pixels) for N9, to conform with the Windows Phone specifications list, which includes three capacitive softkeys placed under the glass. A through-colored unibody shell is made from polycarbonate plastic. It was replaced as the flagship by Nokia Lumia 900, which was originally released for the American market through AT&T before its worldwide release. On 5 September 2012, the Nokia Lumia 820, the successor of the Nokia Lumia 800, was presented. The improvements are Windows Phone 8, dual core processor, front camera, wireless charging option, exchangeable covers, and bigger screen."

J\u00f8rgen Skafte Rasmussen, the Danish-born entrepreneurial industrialist who had purchased Audi-Werke in 1928, had previously, in 1927, purchased the manufacturing plant of the bankrupt Detroit-based Rickenbacker business and shipped it home to Germany. He installed it in a factory he owned just outside Zschopau, near to Audi's own Zwickau plant. The plan was to build large, relatively inexpensive US-style engines for sales to other German auto-makers. The plan failed in that Rasmussen failed to secure any orders for the engines, so he instead produced two models of his own which used engines produced using the Rickenbacker plant. The Audi Type T (Zwickau) was the second and smaller of these. The vehicle had a six-cylinder engine with 3,838\u00a0cc of displacement. It developed a maximum output of  at 3,200 rpm, which was conveyed to the rear wheel through a four-speed manual transmission controlled using a central floor-mounted lever. The car had two leaf-sprung solid axles and four-wheel hydraulic brakes. It was available as four-door \"Limousine\" (sedan) or two-door convertible. 76 were made."

The DNA would become Verizon's final non-Motorola Droid smartphone; following its replacement in August 2013 by the HTC One and Droid Maxx, the carrier announced that all future Droid phones would be built exclusively by Motorola. In June 2013, the Butterfly was succeeded by the HTC Butterfly S. It is the second smartphone in the world to be announced with a 1080p display, after Oppo's Find 5, and the first phone to be released with one. The phone has Android version 4.1, a quad-core 1.5\u00a0GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro processor, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 2.1-megapixel front camera. It comes with 2\u00a0GB of RAM and a 2020\u00a0mAh battery. The Butterfly is water resistant with an IP rating of X5 and has a 5-inch \"Super LCD 3\" display with full HD resolution (1920x1080 pixels). This translates to a pixel density of 440 ppi. In comparison,  The HTC One X offers 312 ppi. The Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX HD (HD has 720p display) at 312ppi, the iPhone 5's \"Retina display\", 326 ppi, and the Nokia Lumia 920, 332 ppi. The display is manufactured by Sharp, JDI. In India it was launched at a price of 44,900, making it the most expensive Android smartphone in India at the time. However, after the launch of Vertu Ti for 600,000, it lost that title. In summer of 2013, the Butterfly was succeeded by the HTC Butterfly S in Asia. The Butterfly S was never released in Japan.

        "title": "Opel 10/40 PS_Summary",
        "content": "The Opel 10/40 PS is a luxury car manufactured by Opel. The car was introduced in May 1925 as the Opel 10/50 PS, but by the time production got under way in July 1925 it had become the Opel 10/45 PS, and it very soon thereafter became the Opel 10/40 PS, a name which it retained throughout the rest of a production run which lasted till November 1929.   The name followed the widely used German naming convention of the time whereby the first digit \u2013 here \u201c10\u201d represented the engine\u2019s tax horsepower (Steuer-PS) (effectively, in the case of German cars of the period, a linear function of the engine capacity) and the second digit represented the manufacturer\u2019s estimate of the actual horsepower.   The design of the car consciously followed the example of Opel 4/14 PS, being a paragon of engineering simplicity designed for ease of manufacture. The engine was a 2620 cc four cylinder unit for which (after a few months of heightened  optimism) the manufacturer quoted a maximum output of  at 2,800 rpm.   This converted into a listed top speed of 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) on the standard length car, and 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) on the heavier long wheel base version. Most cars came with a  wheel base, intended for 4/5 seater bodywork.   A longer  wheelbase was also offered  for 6/7 seater bodywork. At launch in 1925 the car was priced by Opel in bare chassis form at 7,000 Marks for the standard wheelbase length and 7,600 Marks for the long wheelbase.   By 1928 these prices had almost halved to 3,750 Marks and 4,000 Marks respectively.   For customers happy to choose one of the standard bodies from Opel, the entry level car was the 4/5 seater 4 door \u201cTourenwagen\u201d, a topless Torpedo style model priced in 1925 at 8,500 Marks which by 1928 had gone down to 4,800 Marks.   There was also a 4/5 seater \u201cLimousine\u201d (sedan/saloon) and there were long wheelbase versions of each, incorporating space for a third row of seats.  The two door 4/5 seater \u201cStadt-Coup\u00e9\u201d (City coup\u00e9) was the most expensive standard wheel base car at 10,500 Marks in 1925 and 5,400 Marks by 1928. The production of the Opel 10/40 PS took place directly after a period of hyperinflation, and it is difficult to find clear data on consumer price inflation/deflation in the German economy as government wrestled with currency stabilisation during this period, but it is likely that for most people a significant portion of the price reductions on the Opel 10/40 PS were real money reductions.   The Opel 10/40 PS was notably less expensive than cars of this size from other German auto-makers, because Opel was the first and at this time the only manufacturer in Germany manufacturing cars using a Ford inspired production  line system.   The approach was cheap especially where, as in the case of the 10/40 PS, the car was developed to be simple and cheap to produce.  Opel were content to leave technical innovation to other manufacturers.   In 1920 the government had imposed prohibitive tariffs  against importing foreign automobiles, but the de facto prohibition was repealed in October 1925, and during 1925 both Ford and Chevrolet invested heavily in establishing German sales operations.  After this it became possible to find cheaper cars comparable in size and concept to the Opel 10/40 PS  from Chevrolet or Ford, but in reality it took a few years for the American concerns to become established in Germany, and when they did decide to build themselves significant shares of the German auto-market, General Motors employed the strategy of buying Germany\u2019s leading mass market auto-producer, which happened to be Opel.   Meanwhile, at a time when few people could afford any sort of car, and those that could were in no position to pay premium prices, the 10/40 PS dominated its class in the mid-1920s, and is remembered as the most popular \u201cmiddle class\u201d German car of the period. The car changed very little during its 4\u00bd year production run, but from somewhere in the middle of 1927 the radiator was mildly redesigned and at the end of the year the \u201cLimousine\u201d bodied cars received slightly less squared off roof edges. Opel produced and sold 13,161 of their big four cylinder \u201cmiddle class car\u201d between 1925 and 1929, and despite the low price, they were able to sell the car profitably while other German auto-makers were seen to obsess over technical progress often taking risks with the overall financial viability of their business as they did so.   The Opel was a commercial success."

The new company's models for 1926 were unencumbered by an excess of technical sophistication, but came from a company with a long-standing reputation for quality:  serious teething problems afflicting the early cars were the focus of conflict between Daimler-Benz Chairman, Wilhelm Kissel and the Technical Director responsible for the new models:  Porsche's employment contract was not renewed beyond 1928, which led to an acrimonious litigation."

Once Eutelsat 3B is launched in 2014 this satellite will be moved to 7\u00b0E. The satellite has four footprints and broadcasts on both Ka band and Ku band. Three footprints will serve Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa in both Ka and Ku bands. The fourth footprint will cover sub-Saharan Africa but only in Ku band. It will have 56 transponders in total. The satellite was built by Thales Alenia Space using their spacebus 4000 satellite bus. The satellite will be launched by International Launch Services from pad 39 at Site 200 at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The launch will use a Proton-M rocket with a Briz-M upper stage. The first three stages of the Proton fire for the first 9 minutes, 42 seconds. After that the Briz-M upper stage takes over with five separate burns until the space craft separates from the upper stage 9 hours and 13 minutes after launch. The satellite launched on 14 May 2013 at 16:02 UTC and was successfully placed into geostationary transfer orbit. It was given the International Designator 2013-022A and the US satellite catalog reference 39163. Eutelsat name their satellites after their locations so it is likely that this satellite will change name when it is moved. Eutelsat 3C used to be called Atlantic Bird 4A when it was located at 7\u00b0W. It was renamed to 3C when it moved to 3\u00b0E. Eutelsat 3A was likewise renamed when it moved."

The device was released to mostly positive reception; the G2 was universally praised for LG's efforts to produce a more seamless and compact design that nonetheless maximized screen size, its high performance, the quality of its display and primary camera, along with its long-lasting battery. Critics were divided on certain aspects of its design, such as its rear button layout, and its plastic chassis\u2014which was panned for closely resembling recent Samsung Galaxy products and being a regression from the glass-based chassis of the Optimus G. Similarly, while its software and user interface was praised for its usability and large number of customization options, some reviewers felt that the software suffered from feature creep and contained notable usability regressions in comparison to \"stock\" Android. Sales of the G2 exceeded LG's estimates; in late-December 2013, a Korean news agency reported that at least 3 million units of the G2 had been sold worldwide."

        "content": "SS Prinz Adalbert, was a German ocean liner of the Hamburg America Line (Hapag), ordered as one of five Prince-class vessels for their newly established service to the East Coast of South America. She was built by Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau & Machinen Fabrik, Bremen-Vegesack and launched on 21 August 1902. She sailed from Hamburg on her maiden voyage to Brazil on 20 January 1903, and three years later was in service between Genoa and Buenos Aires. Later the liner moved to North Atlantic services. In 1912, the Prinz Adalbert was one of several ships to sight the iceberg suspected of sinking . On the declaration of War in August 1914, Prinz Adalbert was seized by Britain while lying in port at Falmouth, Cornwall. She was requisitioned by the Admiralty, but formally condemned by the Prize Court only in March 1916.  The circumstances had been disputed as she had entered Falmouth after hearing of the outbreak of war between Germany and France while on a normal commercial voyage from Philadelphia to Hamburg, but before the declaration by the UK of war with Germany. Despite being advised to leave Falmouth, the master chose to remain. The ship was commissioned as the accommodation ship Prince at Invergordon on 17 December 1914 and later as the repair ship Princetown. After being paid off on 20 October 1916 and disposed of for sale on 23 December 1916, the ship was sold at auction in a damaged state to Compagnie de Navigation Sud Atlantique of Marseille on 17 January 1917, reconditioned in England and renamed Al\u00e9sia. On 5 September 1917 she was bound for Bordeaux from Cardiff to enter service to South America, when she was torpedoed and damaged in the Atlantic Ocean  northwest of Ushant, Finist\u00e8re, France by the Imperial German Navy submarine . The damaged ship was torpedoed again and sunk on 6 September by the German submarine  off Ushant in position 48\u00b049'N 5\u00b000'W."

It was unveiled at the March 2015 Geneva Motor Show. The name Regera is a Swedish verb, meaning \"to reign\" or \"to rule.\" Koenigsegg plans to produce only 80 units of the car, all of which have been sold. The Regera was developed and designed to be a more practical, luxurious, grand touring alternative to the rest of Koenigsegg's lightweight sports car lineup; initially the Agera and currently the Jesko. As a result, it is less focused on-track performance and spartan weight reduction and more focused on the smooth and instant delivery of power provided by its overhauled powertrain. Koenigsegg states that the Regera will be one of the most powerful and fastest-accelerating hybrid production cars produced. The introduction of the Regera alongside the Agera RS in 2015 resulted in Koenigsegg, for the first time ever, simultaneously having two models in production. This role was passed from the Agera to the Jesko in 2019, which has since shared the production line with the Regera."

Following a restructuring of this division it was sold to Mowag which is now responsible for support. The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 is very compact as it is designed to operate in the Swiss Air Force's aircraft caverns (or underground hangars). It runs on diesel fuel to lower the risk of fire. For precise maneuvering around the caverns, pilot tunnels and shelters it is equipped with special downward-shining floor lighting headlights to help the driver to follow floor markings. It is also used to provide a power supply to aircraft without an Auxiliary power unit. It is used as well as tractors for about 1-4 engine start units or for ad hoc transport of mechanics and tools (e.g. spare wheel and jack by a flat tire of a landed aircraft). JuAir at D\u00fcbendorf Air Base is the only civil user of this aircraft tug type. The aircraft tractors are equipped with four quick couplings as standard. This allows them to be loaded with a crane, in a short time, on every flatbed truck of the Swiss military. The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 are street-legal, but with their 80\u00a0km range and permitted maximum speed of 25\u00a0km/h, however, are not independently suitable for ad-hoc transfers. An ad-hoc capability was achieved with the 4 crane couplings. Such ad-hoc transfers were part of the concept of the Swiss Air Force in the Cold War. It was anticipated to use various motorway sections of the Motorways of Switzerland as air force bases. This was also done several times in exercises. In these exercises the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 was involved. For example, the \"U TAUTO\" exercise on March 24, 1982, the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 were stationed at the Rest area \"Windrose\" near M\u00fcnsingen. JuAir at D\u00fcbendorf AFB is the only civil user of this aircraft tug type."

Constructed by the British shipbuilders Armstrong Mitchell in the early 1880s, Esmeralda was hailed as \"the swiftest and most powerfully armed cruiser in the world\" by William Armstrong, the company's founder. Esmeralda was completed in 1884, and the ship was quickly deployed to Panama in the following year to show the Chilean flag and conduct gunboat diplomacy during an emerging crisis in the region. The cruiser was later used to support the Congressionalist cause during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. In 1894, Esmeralda was sold to Japan via Ecuador. Renamed Izumi, the cruiser did not participate in the major naval battles of the First Sino-Japanese War, but saw active service during the 1904\u20131905 Russo-Japanese War. In the latter, Izumi was one of the first ships to make visual contact with the Russian fleet just before the decisive Battle of Tsushima. After the conflict, the aging cruiser was decommissioned and stricken from the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1912."
