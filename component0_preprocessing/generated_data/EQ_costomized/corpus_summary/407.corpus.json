        "content": "( ), which literally means \"martial heroes\", is a genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists in ancient China. Although  is traditionally a form of fantasy literature, its popularity has caused it to be adapted for such diverse art forms as Chinese opera, , films, television series, and video games. It forms part of popular culture in many Chinese-speaking communities around the world. The word \"\" is a compound composed of the elements  (, literally \"martial\", \"military\", or \"armed\") and  (, literally \"chivalrous\", \"vigilante\" or \"hero\"). A martial artist who follows the code of  is often referred to as a  (, literally \"follower of \") or  (, literally \"wandering \"). In some translations, the martial artist is referred to as a \"swordsman\" or \"swordswoman\" even though they may not necessarily wield a sword. The heroes in wuxia fiction typically do not serve a lord, wield military power, or belong to the aristocratic class. They often originate from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society. A code of chivalry usually requires wuxia heroes to right and redress wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove oppressors, and bring retribution for past misdeeds. Chinese  traditions can be compared to martial codes from other cultures, such as the Japanese samurai ."

        "content": "Otello () is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Arrigo Boito, based on Shakespeare's play Othello. It was Verdi's penultimate opera, first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 5 February 1887. The composer was reluctant to write anything new after the success of Aida in 1871, and he retreated into retirement. It took his Milan publisher Giulio Ricordi the next ten years, first to encourage the revision of Verdi's 1857 Simon Boccanegra by introducing Boito as librettist and then to begin the arduous process of persuading and cajoling Verdi to see Boito's completed libretto for Otello in July/August 1881. However, the process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. It wasn't until 1884, five years after the first drafts of the libretto, that composition began, with most of the work finishing in late 1885. When it finally premiered in Milan on 5\u00a0February 1887, it proved to be a resounding success, and further stagings of Otello soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America."

Though now considered a major 19th-century English novel, even Hardy's fictional masterpiece, Tess of the d'Urbervilles received mixed reviews when it first appeared, in part because it challenged the sexual morals of late Victorian England. Tess was portrayed as a fighter not only for her rights, but also for the rights of others."

        "content": "OK Computer is the third studio album by English rock band Radiohead, released on 21 May 1997 on EMI subsidiaries Parlophone and Capitol Records. Radiohead self-produced the album with Nigel Godrich, an arrangement they have used for their subsequent albums. Other than the song \"Lucky\", recorded in 1995, Radiohead recorded OK Computer in Oxfordshire and Bath in 1996 and early 1997, mostly in the historic mansion St Catherine's Court. The band distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computers abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work. The album's lyrics depict a world fraught with rampant consumerism, social alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise; in this capacity, OK Computer has been said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation through recording on a staircase, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Guitarist Ed O'Brien estimated that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live. Despite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, OK Computer reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was soon certified 5\u00d7 platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. The songs \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\", \"Lucky\" and \"No Surprises\" were released as singles. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide. A remastered version with additional tracks, OKNOTOK 1997 2017, was released in 2017, marking the album's twentieth anniversary. In 2019, in response to an internet leak, Radiohead released MiniDiscs [Hacked], comprising hours of demos, rehearsals, live performances and other material. OK Computer received critical acclaim and has been cited by listeners, critics and musicians as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for the Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. In 2014, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

It was recorded with producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown of Oxford, England. After the stress of promoting Radiohead's acclaimed 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke wanted to diverge from rock music. Drawing influence from electronic music, ambient music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music, Radiohead used instruments such as modular synthesisers, ondes Martenot, brass and strings. They processed guitar sounds, incorporated samples and loops, and manipulated their recordings with software such as Pro Tools and Cubase. Yorke wrote impersonal and abstract lyrics, cutting up phrases and assembling them at random. Radiohead considered releasing the material as a double album, but decided it was too dense; a second album of material from the sessions, Amnesiac, was released eight months later. Kid A was widely anticipated. In a departure from industry practice, Radiohead released no singles or music videos and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. Instead, they became one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool; Kid A was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services, and the album was leaked before release. In 2000, Radiohead toured Europe in a custom-built tent without corporate logos. Kid A debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart, and became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States, where it sold over 207,000 copies in its first week. It has been certified platinum in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the US and the UK. Like OK Computer, it won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Its departure from Radiohead's earlier sound divided fans and critics, and some dismissed it as pretentious, deliberately obscure, or derivative. However, it later attracted wide acclaim; at the end of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2020 Rolling Stone ranked it number 20 on its updated list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Kid A Mnesia, an anniversary reissue compiling Kid A, Amnesiac and previously unreleased material, was released in 2021."

        "content": "Weird Tales is an American fantasy and horror fiction pulp magazine founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom went on to be popular writers, but within a year, the magazine was in financial trouble.  Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger, and refinanced Weird Tales, with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor.  The first issue under Wright's control was dated November 1924.  The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks, it prospered over the next 15 years.  Under Wright's control, the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \"The Unique Magazine\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos stories first appeared in Weird Tales, starting with \"The Call of Cthulhu\" in 1928.  These were well-received, and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu.  Robert E. Howard was a regular contributor, and published several of his Conan the Barbarian stories in the magazine, and Seabury Quinn's series of stories about Jules de Grandin, a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural, was very popular with the readers.  Other well-liked authors included Nictzin Dyalhis, E. Hoffmann Price, Robert Bloch, and H. Warner Munn.  Wright published some science fiction, along with the fantasy and horror, partly because when Weird Tales was launched,  no magazines were specializing in science fiction, but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as Amazing Stories in 1926.  Edmond Hamilton wrote a good deal of science fiction for Weird Tales, though after a few years, he used the magazine for his more fantastic stories, and submitted his space operas elsewhere. In 1938, the magazine was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, and within two years, Wright, who was ill, was replaced by Dorothy McIlwraith as editor.  Although some successful new authors and artists, such as Ray Bradbury and Hannes Bok, continued to appear, the magazine is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s.  Weird Tales ceased publication in 1954, but since then, numerous attempts have been made to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973.  The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran with an occasional hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s, the title was changed to Worlds of Fantasy and Horror because of licensing issues, with the original title returning in 1998. The magazine is regarded by historians of fantasy and science fiction as a legend in the field, with Robert Weinberg, author of a history of the magazine, considering it \"the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines\".  Weinberg's fellow historian, Mike Ashley, is more cautious, describing it as \"second only to Unknown in significance and influence\", adding that \"somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of Weird Tales\"."

It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System. On January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about . It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) man-made object ever launched from Earth.  It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which as of 2021 is that of the Parker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of . The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere. Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems, except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.

Continuing the stylistic shift away from the Britpop sound of the band's early career, 13 explores experimental, psychedelic and electronic music. Recording took place from June to October 1998 in London and Reykjav\u00edk. The album marks a departure of the band's longtime producer, Stephen Street, with his role being filled by William Orbit, who they had chosen after the release of the remix album, Bustin' + Dronin' (1998). Relationships between the band members were reported to be strained, with members frequently missing from the sessions. Lyrically, the album is significantly darker and more innovative than Blur's previous efforts, being heavily inspired by Damon Albarn's breakup with long-term girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, which followed an increasingly strained relationship. This album was the last in over a decade to feature the original line-up as Coxon left the band during the sessions of their next album Think Tank (2003), before returning for The Magic Whip (2015). 13 was released on 15 March 1999 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making it Blur's fourth consecutive studio album to reach the top spot. The album was later certified Platinum. 13 also reached number one in Norway and charted within the top 20 in many other countries. The album produced three singles \u2013 \"Tender\", \"Coffee & TV\" and \"No Distance Left to Run\" \u2013 which charted at number 2, number 11 and number 14 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. 13 met with favourable reviews and received a nomination for the Mercury Prize, as well as for Best Album at the 2000 NME Awards."

The songs were written by vocalist Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene and the album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances that drew on elements of jazz, ambient, blues, classical music, and dub. These long-form recordings were then heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format. Spirit of Eden was a radical departure from Talk Talk's earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to the success of 1986's The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. Despite its mixed reception, the album's stature grew more favourable in subsequent years, with contemporary critics describing Spirit of Eden as an early progenitor of the post-rock genre. In 2013, NME ranked it at number 95 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."

Historically, the first surname was the father's first surname, and the second the mother's first surname. In recent years in Spain, the order of the surnames in a family is decided when registering the first child, but the traditional order is nearly universally chosen (99.53% of the time). Often, the practice is to use one given name and the first surname most of the time (e.g. \"Miguel de Unamuno\" for Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo); the complete name is typically reserved for legal, formal, and documentary matters. Both surnames are sometimes systematically used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero) to get a more customized name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in \"Lorca\", \"Picasso\" or \"Zapatero\". This does not affect alphabetization: \"Lorca\", the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under \"Garc\u00eda Lorca\", not \"Lorca\" or \"Garc\u00eda\"."

The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968. After about two months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically, the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s. The album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very few copies and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single \"Hush\", an energetic rock track written by Joe South and originally recorded by Billy Joe Royal, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s. Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider Shades of Deep Purple an important piece in the history of Deep Purple."

        "content": "The Man Who Sold the World is the third studio album by English musician David Bowie. It was originally released by Mercury Records in the United States on 4 November 1970 and in the United Kingdom on 10 April 1971. The album was produced by Tony Visconti and recorded at Trident and Advision Studios in London during April and May 1970. It features the first appearances of guitarist Mick Ronson and drummer Mick Woodmansey on a Bowie record, who would later become famous as members of the Spiders from Mars. Following the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of Bowie's previous 1969 self-titled album, The Man Who Sold the World marked a shift toward hard rock, with elements of blues rock. The lyrics are also darker than his previous releases, exploring themes of insanity, religion, technology and war. None of the songs from the album were released as official singles, although some tracks appeared as B-sides of singles between 1970 and 1973. Originally titled Metrobolist, a play on Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis, the title was changed at the last minute by Mercury without Bowie's consultation. The album was released with different cover artwork in the US and the UK. For the US release, the artwork was a cartoon-like drawing of a cowboy in front of an asylum. It was drawn by Michael J. Weller and based on an image of actor John Wayne. Bowie was unenthusiastic about the cover, so he enlisted Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The final image, featuring Bowie wearing a blue dress designed by fashion designer Michael Fish, was used as the cover for the UK release. The Man Who Sold the World was reissued by RCA Records in 1972, featuring a black-and-white picture of Bowie's then-current character Ziggy Stardust on the sleeve, but reissues since 1990 have revived the original UK artwork. The Man Who Sold the World was originally better received by music critics in the US than in the UK. Nevertheless, it was a commercial failure in both countries; however, the 1972 reissue managed to chart in both the US and the UK. Retrospectively, the album has been praised by critics for the band's performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics, being considered by many to be the start of Bowie's \"classic period\". It has since been reissued multiple times and was remixed in 2020, under its original title Metrobolist, for its 50th anniversary."

It is an annalistic chronicle that serves as a continuation of Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s Historia Regum Britanniae. Brut y Tywysogion has survived as several Welsh translations of an original Latin version, which has not itself survived. The most important versions are the one in Robert Vaughan's Peniarth MS. 20 and the slightly less complete one in the Red Book of Hergest. The version entitled Brenhinoedd y Saeson (Kings of the English) combines material from the Welsh annals with material from an English source. The Peniarth MS. 20 version begins in 682 with a record of the death of Cadwaladr and ends in 1332. The entries for the earlier years are brief, usually records of deaths and events such as eclipses, plagues or earthquakes, but later entries are much more detailed. The main focus is on the rulers of the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth, but ecclesiastical events are also mentioned, such as the bringing of the date of celebrating Easter in the Welsh church into line with Rome by \"Elbodius\" (Elfodd), Bishop of Bangor, in 768. Events in England, Ireland, Scotland and sometimes France are also briefly chronicled. The original monastic annals are thought to have been written at Strata Florida Abbey, but may have been kept at the old abbey at Llanbadarn Fawr in the 11th century. Annals from other abbeys were also used in the composition. At least one of the Welsh translations is also thought to have been written at Strata Florida."

The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief. Don't Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006 (900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies. As with the previous album, Don't Believe The Truth had significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter Noel Gallagher, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey, an auxiliary member of Oasis, who performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White, and appeared on the DVD praising all members' contributions. The album received positive reviews from critics, and many cited it as Oasis's best album in a decade. Liam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album through his developing songwriting. Noel has said that the album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel-written Oasis album. The band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2\u00a0million people at a total of 113 concerts.

The album was released in 1977 in two different versions, comprising a total of 30 songs by the Beatles. The performances were recorded on a home tape machine using a single microphone, resulting in a low fidelity recording. Ted \"Kingsize\" Taylor began to investigate possible marketing of the tapes in 1973. The tapes were eventually bought by Paul Murphy and subjected to extensive audio processing to improve the sound, leading to the 1977 album. Although the poor sound quality limits its commercial appeal, the album provides historic insight into the group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when the group were awarded full rights to the performances."

It was recorded in five days in June 1982 and was released in January 1983 through Spiderleg Records. The album was later re-released via Bluurg, the band's own record label. The album is influenced by the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. The most obvious sign of such an influence is the song \"Big Brother\"; Big Brother is the dictatorial political leader figure in Orwell's novel. The song revolves around how \"Big Brother is watching you\", and when Dick Lucas sings \"there's a TV in my front room and it's screwing up my head\", it is a comparison between the telescreen in the novel which monitored citizens constantly and excessive viewing of mass media. Today, there is a huge amount of video surveillance in the United Kingdom, showing the foresight of this subject matter. Like the novel, the album has dystopian overtones. It also describes a world ravaged by war, most likely our world which arguably is, this is suggested by track titles such as \"Dying World\" and \"All Gone Dead\". The latter contains lyrics like \"So long to the world, that's what they said, it's 1984 and it's all gone dead\", which can be seen as another reference to Nineteen Eighty-Four.

While computational methods continue to be developed to interpret biological data, the Bioconductor project is an open source software repository that hosts a wide range of statistical tools developed in the R programming environment. Utilizing a rich array of statistical and graphical features in R, many Bioconductor packages have been developed to meet various data analysis needs. The use of these packages provides a basic understanding of the R programming / command language. As a result, R and Bioconductor packages, which have a strong computing background, are used by most biologists who will benefit significantly from their ability to analyze datasets. All these results provide biologists with easy access to the analysis of genomic data without requiring programming expertise. The project was started in the Fall of 2001 and is overseen by the Bioconductor core team, based primarily at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, with other members coming from international institutions."

        "content": "La Capital is a daily Spanish-language newspaper edited and published in Rosario, province of Santa Fe, Argentina. It was founded on November 15, 1867, and it is the oldest Argentine newspaper still in circulation, which has gained it the title of Decano de la Prensa Argentina (\"Dean of the Argentine Press\"). The name was chosen by its founder, Ovidio Lagos, as a political statement on the part of those, including him, who were lobbying to move the capital of the federal government to Rosario. Rosario was in fact declared the capital three times by Congress, only to face presidential vetoes each time. At the time of its foundation, La Capital was an afternoon newspaper. Newspapers were just forums of political debate with classified ads. Since the beginning, the heading of La Capital included a motto showing a commitment to public opinion: Las columnas de La Capital pertenecen al pueblo, \"La Capital's columns belong to the people\". On 19 August 1868 the editorial building was at 104 Santa Fe St. After that, La Capital turned into a morning newspaper, and in 1870 it moved to Port St. (now Buenos Aires St.). In 1874 and again in 1887 new printing machinery was acquired. In 1889 the editorial moved to a new building at 763 Sarmiento St. and acquired a French Marinoni reaction printer. In 1903 the newspaper changed the format of its pages, abandoning the large sheet sizes. By 1905 the daily edition had 16 pages, and in 1906 it offered a full-color 28-page illustrated supplement. For 111 years, since its foundation, the newspaper employed the \"hot type\" method, that is, with Linotype typesetting machines where molten lead and antimony were used to cast each line of text. In 1978 La Capital shifted to \"cold type\", using the phototypesetting method. In mid-1998 the new publishing plant at Santiago St. near Rivadavia Ave. received its latest innovation, a Goss Urbanite rotating press which weighs 165 tonnes and measures almost 36 m in length. The new plant also features a number of other technologies. Using this, La Capital started a new edition, with a different layout and format, and fully in color. Besides national and international news, the newspaper covers local news from Rosario and its metropolitan area (Greater Rosario), plus other towns in the region and four other provinces besides Santa Fe, reaching about 2 million readers."

        "content": "Yellow Submarine is the tenth  studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 13 January 1969 in the United States and on 17 January in the United Kingdom. It was issued as the soundtrack to the animated film of the same name, which premiered in London in July 1968. The album contains six songs by the Beatles, including four new songs and the previously released \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"All You Need Is Love\". The remainder of the album is a re-recording of the film's orchestral soundtrack by the band's producer, George Martin. The project was regarded as a contractual obligation by the Beatles, who were asked to supply four new songs for the film. Some were written and recorded specifically for the soundtrack, while others were unreleased tracks from other projects. The album was recorded before \u2013 and issued two months after \u2013 the band's self-titled double LP (also known as the \"White Album\") and was not viewed by the band as a significant release. An EP containing only the new songs had been considered, and was mastered, but left unreleased. The original mono mixes were later included in the 2009 compilation Mono Masters. Yellow Submarine reached the top 5 in the UK and the US. It has since been afforded a mixed reception from music critics, some of whom consider that it falls short of the high standard generally associated with the Beatles' work. Another version of the album, the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued on the film's 30th anniversary. It dispenses with the George Martin orchestrations, and includes the six Beatles songs from the original album, along with an additional nine songs heard in the film, all newly remixed."

It was released on March 23, 2007, by Epic Records. After including some Spanish songs on her first two albums, Lopez initially became interested in recording a full-length studio album in 2004 when she recorded a song with her then-husband Marc Anthony for his ninth studio album. After releasing her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), Lopez started working heavily on the album with Anthony, Est\u00e9fano and Julio Reyes Copello in a period of two and a half years. Composed entirely of ballads (and the exception of a few other genres), Como Ama una Mujer talks about love and heartbreak, being organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with many praising her vocals for being more improved than her previous records, but thought the album was too serious and questioned a lack of highlights within the album. Commercially, the album debuted inside the top ten of the US Billboard 200 and marked the highest first-week sales for an artist's debut Spanish album. Elsewhere, it topped the Switzerland charts and became a top-ten album in eight other countries. Two singles were released from the album: \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\" and \"Me Haces Falta\". The first was released on January 26, 2007, and became a success in many countries, reaching number-one in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and on the US Hot Latin Songs, and a top-ten hit elsewhere, while the second single was released  on March 23, 2007, but was a  complete failure. Lopez promoted the album with a co-headlining tour with Anthony in 2007."

At the time, the Yardbirds had been performing as a quartet with Jimmy Page on lead guitar since October 1966. The album includes several familiar Yardbird songs, but often extended with longer instrumental solos.  \"I'm Confused,\" based on Jake Holmes' \"Dazed and Confused\", is a highlight of the album.  Using some different lyrics, Page re-recorded it with Led Zeppelin for their debut album later in 1968. The group was dissatisfied with the recordings and objected to a release of the recordings, but after Page became famous with Led Zeppelin, Epic Records issued the album in September 1971.  Page took legal action and Epic was enjoined from further distribution of the album.  Over the years, there were several more attempts to release the album.  In 2017, Page discovered the concert tapes in his personal archive and remixed the recordings.  An album with the Anderson concert and demo recordings from the same time, were released in November 2017 on Yardbirds '68."

Its screenplay, written by Klimov and Ales Adamovich, is based on the 1978 book I Am from the Fiery Village (original title: \u042f \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438, Ya iz ognennoj derevni, 1977), of which Adamovich was a co-author. Klimov had to fight eight years of censorship from the Soviet authorities before he could be allowed to produce the film in its entirety. The film's plot focuses on the Nazi German occupation of Belarus, and the events as witnessed by a young Belarusian partisan teenager named Flyora, who\u2014against his mother's wishes\u2014joins the Belarusian resistance movement, and thereafter depicts the Nazi atrocities and human suffering inflicted upon the Eastern European villages' populace. The film mixes hyper-realism with an underlying surrealism, and philosophical existentialism with poetical, psychological, political and apocalyptic themes. Come and See received generally positive critical reception upon release, and received the FIPRESCI prize at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival. It has since come to be considered one of the greatest films of all time."

Bryan Blackburn later wrote English-language lyrics for it. First performed in French by Greek singer Vicky Leandros (appearing as Vicky) as the  entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, it has since been recorded by many other musicians, most notably French orchestra leader Paul Mauriat, whose familiar instrumental version (recorded in late 1967) became the only number-one hit by a French lead artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 in America. The song describes the pleasure and pain of love in terms of colours (blue and grey) and elements (water and wind). The English lyrics (\"Blue, blue, my world is blue \u2026\") focus on colours only (blue, grey, red, green, and black), using them to describe components of lost love. The English version by Vicky Leandros also appeared as \"Colours of Love\" in some locations including the UK."

A slightly different version of the album was also released in the U.S. in 1968 as Sire Records SES 97012, one of the first releases on that label.  Although it was not a success when it was first released, it is now widely regarded as one of the best psychedelic rock albums ever made. The lack of commercial success can be explained by the long delay between initial recording sessions in spring 1967 and final release in February 1968.  By the time the album arrived in record stores the psychedelic trend had already begun to abate.  EMI provided a very small recording budget and would not allow prints of a colour album cover to be made, although some later re-issues were printed with a modified colour cover. Mark Smotroff of Audiophile Reviews called the album \"a knockout lost classic\"."

Holly is known as an English or Irish surname (variant Holley) it is either locational, ultimately derived from the Old English hol l\u0113ah \"[dwelling by] the clearing by the hollow\", or descriptive, from hol-\u0113age \"hollow-eyed\". In Ireland, it was also used as a translation of the name Mac Cuilinn, which is derived from cuileann, the Gaelic name of the holly tree, and by extension sometimes of the similar-sounding  McQuillan surname of Ulster. The masculine names Holly, Hollie were derived from the surname, but have mostly fallen out of use since the mid 20th century due to the rise in popularity of the feminine name. Hollis is an English surname derived from a Middle English holis \"[dwelling by] holly trees\"; it was also used as a masculine given name. Holly (variants Hollie, Holley) was first used as a feminine given name in the 20th century, as a \"botanical\" name given to girls, in reference to, or at least secondarily associated with, the holly tree. While the feminine name is on record in the United States since the 1930s, its surge in popularity was due to Holly Golightly, the socialite protagonist in Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958), which was made into a film starring Audrey Hepburn in 1961. The name of this character is stated to be short for Holiday (rather than a reference to the plant). The name peaked in popularity in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, and has declined since, ranking at #380 in the United States as of 2009. It was popularly given in England and Wales during the 2000s, staying in the top 30 girls' names throughout 1996\u20132012, with a peak at rank #12 in 2002 (and dropping to rank #33 as of 2013). A tendency to give the name to girls born on or near Christmas has also been observed. More recent eccentric spellings of the feminine name include Holli (1970s), Holleigh, Hollee, Hollye."

The song has lyrics by Qamar Jalalabadi and was composed by O.P. Nayyar. The tune at the beginning of the song was created by S Hazara Singh, the Hawaiian guitarist of OP Nayyar. In the movie, Helen plays \"Chin Chin Chu\", a flirtatious dancer from Shanghai who sings the song. The song became highly popular, and rejuvenated the career of the singer Geeta Dutt. It was also the first major hit for Helen. The song was parodied as 'Mera naam mum mum mum' in Hum Saath Saath Hain in one of the intros of \"Sunoji Dulhan\". A homage to the song was released on 10 August 2018 and is featured in the 2018 film Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi. Presented by Eros International & Aanand L Rai, Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi is a Colour Yellow Production. Director Mudassar Aziz has provided additional lyrics to this version of the song, while Punjabi singing sensation and Hindi film debutant Jassi Gill has provided the male vocals, Sonakshi Sinha who plays the titular character in Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi has provided the female vocals.

Their grammatical forms and meanings have been reconstructed by modern linguists, based on similarities found across all Indo-European languages. This article discusses nouns and adjectives; Proto-Indo-European pronouns are treated elsewhere. The Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) had eight or nine cases, three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and probably originally two genders (animate and neuter), with the animate later splitting into the masculine and the feminine. Nominals fell into multiple different declensions. Most of them had word stems ending in a consonant (called athematic stems) and exhibited a complex pattern of accent shifts and/or vowel changes (ablaut) among the different cases. Two declensions ended in a vowel () and are called thematic; they were more regular and became more common during the history of PIE and its older daughter languages. PIE very frequently derived nominals from verbs. Just as English giver and gift are ultimately related to the verb give,  'giver' and  'gift' are derived from  'to give', but the practice was much more common in PIE. For example,  'foot' was derived from  'to tread', and  'house' from  'to build'."

Although predominantly a boys' name, the name is occasionally given to girls in the form of \"Shervineh\" or \"Shervin Dokht\". The name is understood to mean both \"eternal soul\" and \"like a lion\". Shervin is thought to be the shortened form of Anushirvan. One interpretation of the name is a combination of \"anousheh\", meaning eternal, and \"ravan\", meaning soul. An alternative translation of Shervin is \"like a lion\", derived from the words \"shir\", meaning 'lion', and \"vin\", meaning 'resembling'. Shervin was also the name of several princes in the ancient Tabarestan region of Iran (today's Mazandaran and Gilan), including a grandfather of the author of Marzbannameh (Marzban ibn-e Rostam ibn-e Shervin, 12th century). In Savadkuh County, located at the center of Mazandaran Province in Iran, part of the Alborz mountain chain is named Shervin and is one of the local natural attractions. The name Shervin also exists in Dutch, spelled \"Shirwin\". The Dutch form has the same meaning as the Persian form."

It was self-released on 10 October 2007 as a pay-what-you-want download, followed by a physical release internationally through XL Recordings and in North America through TBD Records. It was Radiohead's first release after their recording contract with EMI ended with their album Hail to the Thief (2003). Radiohead began work on In Rainbows in early 2005. In 2006, after initial recording sessions with new producer Spike Stent proved fruitless, the band toured Europe and North America, performing the new material. After re-enlisting longtime producer Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded in the country houses Halswell House and Tottenham House, the Hospital Club in London, and their studio in Oxfordshire. They incorporated a variety of styles and instruments, using electronic instruments, strings, piano and the ondes Martenot. The lyrics are less political and more personal than previous Radiohead albums. EMI, which had been recently acquired by Terra Firma, hoped to sign Radiohead to a new record contract; however, Radiohead did not trust the new management and negotiations collapsed over ownership of their back catalogue. Instead, they self-released In Rainbows online, saying this removed barriers between artists and fans and liberated them from traditional promotional formats. The pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines internationally and created debate about the implications for the music industry; some praised Radiohead for challenging old models and finding new ways to connect with fans, while others felt it set a dangerous precedent at the expense of less successful artists. Radiohead promoted In Rainbows with webcasts, music videos, remix and music video competitions, and a worldwide tour. \"Jigsaw Falling into Place\" and \"Nude\" were released as singles; \"Nude\" became Radiohead's first US top-40 song since their debut single \"Creep\" (1992). The retail release of In Rainbows topped the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, and by October 2008 the album had sold over three million copies worldwide. It received critical acclaim, winning Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, and was ranked one of the best albums of the year and the decade by various publications. Rolling Stone ranked In Rainbows on its updated lists of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 336 in 2012 and number 387 in 2020."

The newspaper was famous for attracting high profile names in Armenian literature and journalism, including Shahan Shahnour, Schavarch Nartouni, Zareh Vorpuni, Hrach Zartarian, Nshan Beshiktashlian, and Hrant Samuel. After the migration of Armenians from the area of Musa Dagh (incorporated to Turkey in 1938) to Lebanon, who settled in the area of Anjar, Lebanon, in 1940, the initiative and efforts of editor Schavarch Missakian organized a contribution campaign among Armenians living in France. As a result, the \"Haratch\" Elementary School was built next to the newly established St. Paul church in the village. The school, officially opened in 1941, was considered a gift from the Armenians living in France. It was later renamed \"Haratch Calouste Gulbenkian Secondary School.\" Haratch ceased publication on 9 June 1940 because of the Nazi occupation of France and resumed publication on 8 April 1945 after the liberation of the country. On 26 January 1957, the founder of the paper, Schavarch Missakian, died, and his daughter Arpik Missakian assumed the responsibilities of publisher and editor-in-chief. In 1976 Haratch added a monthly supplement of literature and the arts, entitled Midk y\u00e8v Arvest (). Due to decreasing readership (circulation in the last years had fallen to less than one thousand copies), Arpik Missakian, owner and editor-in-chief, decided to close it down. The last issue (22,214) of \"Haratch\" was published with the date 30\u201331 May 2009. Five months after the demise of the daily, a new group of intellectuals started publishing Nor Haratch. The first issue of Nor Haratch was published on 27 October 2009. With its new, independent staff, administration and ownership, Nor Haratch should be considered a separate new publication, rather than a continuation of the original Haratch."

        "content": "Thomas is a common surname of English, Welsh, Irish, Scottish, French, German, Dutch, and Danish origin. It derives from the medieval personal name, of Biblical origin, from Aramaic \u05ea\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d0 t'om'a, a byname meaning 'twin'. It was borne by one of the disciples of Christ, best known for his skepticism about Christ's resurrection (John 20:24\u201329). The th- spelling in English results from the initial letter of the name in the Greek New Testament being a theta. The English pronunciation as t rather than a dental fricative is the result of French influence from an early date. In Britain, the surname is widely distributed throughout the country, but especially common in Cornwall and Wales. Thomas is the ninth most common surname in the United Kingdom. It is found as a personal name among Christians in India, and in the United States; it is also used as a family name among the Saint Thomas Christian families from Kerala, South India. In the 1990 United States Census, Thomas was the twelfth most common surname, accounting for 0.3% of the population. In France, Thomas (pronounced ) is the third most widespread surname after Martin and Bernard, with over 100,000 people with this name."

In promotion of the album, Oasis embarked on a world tour, debuting in Seattle at the WaMu Theater, and continuing for eighteen months. In 2009, the tour concluded (due to Noel Gallagher quitting the band) with major dates at some of the UK's biggest stadiums, notably the new Wembley Stadium, Sunderland's Stadium of Light and Edinburgh's Murrayfield. They also performed three hometown shows at Manchester's Heaton Park. Dig Out Your Soul received generally positive reviews from critics for its harder rock and psychedelic sound."

It is a cognate of Dutch Godfried, German Gottfried and Old English Gotfrith and Godfrith. Alexander MacBain considered it as being found in the Gaelic and Welsh forms; potentially before or contemporary to the Anglo-Saxon, with the examples of Goraidh, Middle Gaelic Gofraig (1467 MS.), Godfrey (do.), Irish Gofraidh (F.M.), Middle Irish Gothfrith, Gofraig (Tigernach, 989), Early Irish Gothfraid (Lib. Lein.), E. Welsh Gothrit (Ann. Camb.). Macbain suggested these Celtic forms of the name were closer related to the Anglo-Saxon Godefrid than the Norse Go\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r, Gudr\u00f8d or G\u00f3r\u00f6\u00f0r; however he does not elaborate further on the origin or relation. The form as 'Geoffrey' was probably introduced to Norman England. It was also Anglicised as Jeffrey later after the name became more popular after the likes of President Jefferson. Popularity of the name declined after the medieval period, but it was revived in modern England and the British Empire at large. Modern hypocorisms include  Geoff or Jeff. Jeffrey and its variants are found as surnames, usually ending in -s (e.g. Jefferies, Jaffrays); The surname Jefferson is also a patronymic version of the given name."

        "content": "In Finland, a person must have a surname and at least one given name with up to three middle names permitted. Surnames are inherited either patrilineally or matrilineally, while given names are usually chosen by a person's parents. Finnish names come from a variety of dissimilar traditions that were consolidated only in the early 20th century. The first national act on names came into force in 1921, and it made surnames mandatory. Between 1930 and 1985, the Western Finnish tradition whereby a married woman took her husband's surname was mandatory. Previously in Eastern Finland, this was not necessarily the case. On 1 January 2019, the reformed Act on Forenames and Surnames came into force. Finnish given names are often of Christian origin (e.g., Jukka from Greek Johannes), but Finnish and Swedish origins are also common. In Finnish, the letter \"j\" denotes the approximant , as in English you. For example, the two different names Maria and Marja are pronounced nearly identically. The letter \"y\" denotes the vowel , not found in English, but similar to German \"\u00fc\" and French \"u\". \"R\" is rolled. The stress is always on the first syllable in Finnish. For example, Yrj\u00f6 K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen is pronounced . Double letters always stand for a geminate or longer sound (e.g., Marjaana has a stressed short  followed by an unstressed long  and then another unstressed short ). Pronunciation of Swedish names is similar, but long vowels are not doubled and the stress may be on any syllable. Finland has a long bilingual history and it is not unusual for Finnish speakers to have Swedish surnames or given names. Such names may be pronounced according to Finland\u2013Swedish phonology or, depending on the person named, the person speaking and the language used, a Fennicized variant. When writing Finnish names without the Finnish alphabet available (such as in e-mail addresses), the letters \"\u00e4\" and \"\u00f6\" are usually replaced with \"a\" and \"o\", respectively (e.g., P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen as Paakkonen). This is not the same, but visually recognizable."

It was first published in 1837 in the literary magazine Sovremennik on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the battle. In Russia, it is required reading in most schools. The poem was based on his 1831 teenage version, The Battlefield of Borodino (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430). The poem starts with the direct appeal \"Tell me, uncle,...\". Lermontov had several relatives (Arsenyevs and Stolypins) who were veterans of the Patriotic War of 1812, and there have been speculation that the poem was based on the narrations of one of them.

It launched in April 2008 and switched to online-only distribution in January 2009 after having published a total of ten issues. The magazine continued online until 2020, when that year's edition of its Faces series prominently mentioned the website having seized publication. It enjoyed a good run and was voted Best Music Site in 2008 and Best Web Publication in 2010 in the Irish Web Awards. Originally, the concept of the magazine involved a hard copy of which there was a charge to purchase. However after six issues it was decided to make the magazine's content free both online and in print. The first issue, April 2008, appeared on Irish shelves on 6 March 2008 and featured Michael Stipe of R.E.M. on the cover. This immediately garnered comparisons between the new magazine's similarities with Hot Press who featured Stipe on their cover at the same time, a move widely thought to be an attempt by Hot Press to stifle State's status as a serious 'alternative' to the more established local magazine. At a price of \u20ac5.50, State charged \u20ac2 more than Hot Press. State was published by Roger Woolman and edited by Hot Press alumni Phil Udell. Contributors included Evening Herald columnist, The Irish Times reviewer and blogger Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson, Rolling Stone writer Kara Manning, award-winning blogger Niall Byrne (a.k.a. Nialler9), Event Guide writer David O'Mahony and The Star feature writer Tanya Sweeney. The magazine's art director, Simon Roche, was named designer of the year by the Periodical Publishers Association of Ireland in December 2008. From October 2008 until January 2009 the magazine was made available for free of charge from a number of venues around Ireland's major cities and online from the magazine's website, following a number of other magazines such as Mongrel, Connected and Analogue Magazine in providing their print content free of charge. The first freely distributed issue of State featured Kings of Leon on the cover. After January 2009, the magazine was only available online from its website."

There are many English villages called Norton or including Norton as part of the name, e.g. Midsomer Norton, Chipping Norton, Brize Norton etc. When surnames started to be used in the Middle Ages, a man from such a village might have the name added e.g. Tom of Norton. Alternatively a man from the north side of any village might be given the name Tom Norton to distinguish him from a Tom from the south side (Tom Sutton). A secondary source for the surname is from the anglicisation of Celtic (Irish and Scottish Gaelic) surnames (e.g. Naughtan). It is also sometimes found as a Jewish surname (probably from the anglicisation of the German surname Norden).

        "content": "Elle (stylized ELLE) is a worldwide women's lifestyle magazine of French origin that focuses on fashion, beauty, health and entertainment. The title means \"she\" or \"her\" in French. It was founded in 1945 by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gordon-Lazareff and her husband, the writer Pierre Lazareff. The magazine's readership has continuously grown since its founding, increasing to 800,000 across France by the 1960s. Elle has since expanded outside of France, creating a global network of publications and readers. Elle'''s Japanese publication was launched in 1969, defining it as the first international Elle publication of many. Previous editors of the magazine include Jean-Dominique Bauby, well known for his memoir, and Roberta Myers, the longest-serving editor-in-chief at Elle. Nina Garcia currently holds the position of editor-in-chief at Elle, appointed after the departure of Myers. Elle is considered the world's largest fashion magazine, with 46 international editions in over 60 countries. Elle magazine has over 69 million readers, with an audience of mostly women. Along with the magazine, the Elle brand includes 33 websites that stretch globally and receive 370 million monthly views. The Lagard\u00e8re Group of France owns the brand. The official Elle headquarters is located in Paris, with licensed publishers located in many other cities. HistoryElle was founded in Paris as an immediate aftermath of World War II and first sold as a supplement to France-Soir, edited at the time by Pierre Lazareff.  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gordon-Lazareff, Elle's pioneering founder, returned to Paris from New York City to create a unique publication that grappled with the many forces shaping the lives of women in France in 1945. Women won the right to vote in 1944, and Elle dove immediately into long-form \"newspaper-like\" features on women's role in national politics and the growing feminist movement. Its 100th issue, published on 14 October 1947, featured the work of Christian Dior just eight months after his debut show. Likewise, Brigitte Bardot had her first Elle cover at age 17, on 7 January 1952, months before her screen debut in Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. By the 1960s, Elle had a readership of 800,000 across France and was said to \"not so much reflect fashion as decree it.\" This dominance was reflected in the famous slogan: \"Si elle lit, elle lit Elle\" 'If she reads, she reads Elle. Lagard\u00e8re Group subsidiary, Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias began pushing Elle outside of Europe in 1969, launching its Japanese publication. In 1985, Elle launched in Britain and the United States. The Chinese version of the magazine was first published in 1988. It was the first four-color fashion magazine offered in China. The magazine was used as an informational and educational tool for opening of the Chinese textile market. By 1991, the magazine's sales were in decline in the U.S. In 1989, Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. launched Elle Decor magazine, focusing on home decor. Elle.com was launched in 2007. In 2011, The Hearst Corporation reached a \u20ac651M deal with Lagard\u00e8re to purchase the rights to publish Elle Magazine in fifteen countries including the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Russia and Ukraine. Lagard\u00e8re, which struggled in the international market in the 2000s, retained the rights to the French edition and would collect royalties from the international editions.Elle Brazil was the first commercial magazine in the world to have a transgender model on its cover, with Lea T. in December 2011. The Brazilian edition had also discovered transgender model Valentina Sampaio and had put her on the cover before French Vogue. Elle printed special collectors' covers for their September 2016 issue, and one of them featured Hari Nef, which was the first time an openly transgender woman had been on the cover of a major commercial British magazine. In 2019, Lagard\u00e8re sold Elle France to Czech Media Invest, parent of Czech News Center. Lagard\u00e8re continues to own the Elle brand. Notable editors-in-chief Elle editors have included Jean-Dominique Bauby, who became known for writing a book after suffering almost total paralysis, and Robbie Myers. In September 2017, it was announced that Roberta Myers was stepping down from the role of editor-in-chief, position she held since 2000, stating through a memo to the staff that \"I want to spend the next seasons as available to my children as I can be, and so I take my leave of Elle now\". A day later of the announcement, it was reported that Nina Garcia, creative director of Marie Claire was appointed as the new editor-in-chief effective 18 September. Patricia Wang was the first editor of Elle China."

        "content": "\"Bobok\" (, Bobok) is a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky that first appeared in 1873 in his self-published Diary of a Writer. The story consists largely of a dialogue between recently deceased occupants of graves in a cemetery, most of whom are fully conscious and retain all the features of their living personalities. The dialogue is overheard by a troubled writer who has lain down near the graves. The title \"Bobok\" refers to a nonsensical utterance repeatedly made by one of the cemetery's residents, an almost completely decomposed corpse who is otherwise silent. The writer also reports a kind of auditory hallucination of the word prior to his hearing of the dialogue. The sound suggests \"little bean\" in Russian, but in the context of the story is taken to be synonymous with gibberish. The philosopher and literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded Bobok as one of the finest works in the literary tradition of Menippean satire, and argues that it encapsulates many of the thematic concerns of Dostoevsky's major novels."

It was edited by Marathi writer Shankar Dattatraya Javdekar from 1950 to 1952. Yadunath Thatte became Sadhana'''s editor in 1956 and continued to lead it until 1982. G.P. Pradhan was the next editor of the weekly. In the early 1970s the magazine provided a forum for voices from the Dalit Panther movement, who were revolting against the treatment of low castes in Indian society. Some of the Dalit writings published by the magazine were considered to be inflammatory by the middle class and even led to calls to ban the concerned issues. Sadhana brought the Dalit activists to the attention to the Marathi intelligentsia, and gave an impetus to the growing dalit movement. The magazine served as a voice for Socialist thought in India and played a key role in the mass awakening during the 21-month-long Emergency Rule in India that was imposed in June 1975. In July 1976, the Government of India led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intimidated the weekly to stop publication by abusive use of national defence laws. The magazine soon reopened, after winning a landmark court case concerning press freedom in which Justice V.D. Tulzapurkar of the Bombay High Court along with Justice B.C. Gadgil quashed the government order seizing the assets of Sadhana Press'', and struck down censorship orders as arbitrary."

It was premiered in 1923 at La Scala in Milan, under the baton of Antonio Guarnieri, since Toscanini was unavailable. The cast featured Irish soprano Margaret Burke Sheridan as Candida, baritone Mariano Stabile as her lover Baldo, and tenor Francesco Merli as the titular Belfagor, a \"arcidiavolo\" who tries to marry a human maiden while in disguise as a nobleman, using gifts of money to her father. The premi\u00e8re obtained a \"full and warm\" approval, with several curtain calls for the composer, but the opinion of the critics was divided, ranging from the enthusiasm of Marinetti, enchanted by the futuristic aspects of the opera, and of the music critic S. A. Lucani, to those who judged opera and libretto absolutely not enjoyable.  wrote that this work looked like an attempt, not fully accomplished, to merge in a comic opera \"the fabolous and the clownish, the miraculous and the sentimental\" and that the comic expressivity was damaged by the absence of \"assertiveness of the melodic plan and its capacity to develop rapidly\"."

It debuted on the Billboard Top Latin Albums at number 12, number three on the Latin Pop Albums and number 21 on the Top Heatseekers Albums. In Mexico, entered at number seven and number five in the category in Spanish. On March 25, two days after its release, Carpe Diem was certified gold; with the help of Belinda offering an autograph session in Mexico City, more than 30,000 copies were sold. The title comes from the Latin phrase that translates literally to \"Long live the day\" or \"Seize the day\", coined by the Roman poet Horace. The phrase was adopted by Belinda who was inspired by the movie Dead Poets Society. Carpe Diem contains, as described by the singer, a much happier, upbeat sound with positive lyrics as opposed to her previous album Utop\u00eda that had a darker, more personal tone to it. Among the producers are the Mexican Golden Baqueiro, who produced the theme \"Sal de mi Piel\" in Los Angeles, and Jimmy Harry, who produced the theme \"Egoista\" and worked on her previous album  Utop\u00eda. The album also features production by French artist Arno Elias, who produced the theme \"Amor Transg\u00e9nico\" as well as the participation of the Spanish Carlos Jean.

It features songs written by Bailey Rae before and after her husband's death, touching on themes of love, lament and solace. The Sea debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also charted at number seven on the Billboard 200 in the United States, where it had sold 156,000 copies by April 2010. A critical success, The Sea received mostly positive reviews and was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize. Bailey Rae supported the album with a concert tour in early 2010."

        "content": "Brothers (simplified Chinese: \u5144\u5f1f; pinyin: Xi\u014dngd\u00ec) is the longest novel written by the Chinese novelist Yu Hua, in total of 76 chapters, separately published in 2005 for the part 1 (of the first 26 chapters) and in 2006 for part 2 (of the rest 50 chapters) by Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House. This was Yu Hua's first novel after a decade or dormancy from writing and publishing works. It has over 180 thousand characters in Chinese, more than the 100 thousand characters that were originally planned for the book. It intertwines tragedy and comedy, and Yu Hua himself admits that the novel is personally his favorite literary work. Brothers was a new realm of literature for Yu Hua, with the novel often being described as extremely crude and expletive. Brothers has experienced great success with nearly 1 million copies sold in China. By 2019, Yu Hua's works had been published in 38 countries and translated into 35 different languages. This success may be contributed to his success publicity tour to gain attraction towards the novel after his hiatus from writing. While reception among Chinese critics was generally negative, the novel was shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize and awarded France's Prix Courrier International in 2008. It was translated into English by Eileen Cheng-yin Chow and Carlos Rojas in 2009, a couple from the Middle Eastern department at Duke University. The story of the novel revolves around the step-brotherhood between Baldy Li and Song Gang who are the protagonists. Their life that has been of absurd and tragedy throughout China's history from the 1960s to the early period of Chinese Economic Reform serves as the main plot. The division of the novel into two parts is contextually on the basis of the death of Li Lan who is the biological mother of Baldy Li and the step-mother of Song Gang. The first part primarily focuses on their childhood, especially during the Cultural Revolution with the collapse of their reorganized family and the tragedy of Song Fanping, the biological father of Song Gang and the Step-father of Baldy Li. The second part  focuses on their adulthood with different life trajectories, especially during the early period of Chinese Economic Reform that formulates the mixture of absurdity and tragedy."

The most prominent explanation is that it is composed of \"ok\" and \"z\". In various modern Turkic languages and in Proto-Turkic language \"ok(h)\" means \"arrow\". Only in Proto-Turkic language, \"ok\" also means \"clan\", and/or \"nation\". Again, only in Proto-Turkic language, \"z\" is the plural suffix. In modern Turkish \"z\" is not the plural suffix anymore, in general. Therefore \"okz\" means \"clans\", \"nations\", and/or \"arrows\". Finally, \"O\u011fuz\" is used both as given names and as names of some of the Turkic clans. O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks are the southwestern branch of Turkish clan system. \"G\u00f6ko\u011fuz\" was a group of O\u011fuz T\u00fcrks who migrated to northwest and named as Gagauz in modern times. There are also groups named as \u00dc\u00e7o\u011fuz (Three O\u011fuz), Sekizo\u011fuz (Eight O\u011fuz), Dokuzo\u011fuz (Nine O\u011fuz), etc. One of the earliest rulers of the Turkic people is also named \"Oghuz Khan\".

The album is Rowland's first release since parting ways with her manager Mathew Knowles and longtime Sony Music record label Columbia Records (through Knowles' Music World Entertainment). Here I Am is predominately a pop, R&B and dance album. It follows Rowland's assertion that \"no one puts her in a box\" with common themes around womanhood, sexual intimacy and love. Originally scheduled for release in 2010, the album was pushed back after the first round of singles were released to mixed critical and commercial reception. \"Commander\" (2010) produced by and featuring David Guetta topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and became a top-ten hit in the United Kingdom and some other European territories. Three other singles: \"Forever and a Day\", \"Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Grown Woman\", all had limited commercial success and are subsequently included on selected editions of the album or excluded altogether. The international version of the album features seventeen songs including ones excluded from the US editions and some remixes. Here I Am also features guest performances from Lil Wayne, Nelly, Rico Love, Lil Playy, The WAV.s and Big Sean. Production of the album was handled by the likes of Rodney Jerkins, Guetta, Jim Jonsin, Hit-Boy, RedOne and The Runners. Love wrote half of the songs on the album, while Rowland co-wrote three songs on the album. After re-recording the majority of the album, a new single featuring Lil Wayne titled \"Motivation\", preceded the album in the United States. It was greeted with a positive reception from critics and topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart as well as peaking in the top-twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rowland's second most successful single as a lead artist in the United States. Here I Am was received well by critics, many of whom praised the strong productions and vocal performances but questioned some of the guests and a lack of the up-tempo dance sound Rowland had spoken of. Here I Am debuted at number one on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number three on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 77,000\u00a0copies. To date, it's Rowland's highest debuting album in the United States."

It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). Garland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new Judge Dredd film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film Judge Dredd, was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio DNA Films, Dredd began principal photography, using 3D cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on practical sets and locations in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Dredd was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film."

According to historian Alex Woolf, the early Gaelic form of the name, Oengus, was borrowed from the Pictish Onuist, which appears in British as Ungust. Woolf noted that these names are all derived from the Celtic *Oinogustos. Linguist John Kneen derived this name from two Celtic elements the following way: *Oino-gustos, meaning \"one-choice\". Woolf also stated that between about AD 350 and AD 660, the Insular Celtic dialects underwent changes which included the loss of the final syllables and unstressed vowels, which affected *Oinogustos thus: *Oinogustos."

It was released by Warner Music Finland digitally on 31 March 2010, with the official physical release following on 14 April. From 31 March to the official physical release date, the album was sold at \u20ac19 in conjunction with Ilta-Sanomat. The album was re-released on 14 January 2011, in a limited vinyl edition. The Finnish-language album, incorporating electro and synthpop elements along with melancholic piano ballads, is named after the island Seili (Sj\u00e4l\u00f6 in Swedish), located off the south-west coast of Finland. The album was produced and co-written by Jukka Immonen with Vartiainen writing also two of the songs. The main lyricists were Teemu Brunila and Mariska who contributed to the thematical dualism of the album\u2014Brunila wrote the happier songs about publicity and finding love while Mariska wrote the lyrics for the songs that deal with darker and more serious themes, such as death. Another lyricist was Paula Vesala (from the pop rock duo PMMP). Vartiainen participated more in the production than with her debut album Ihmisten edess\u00e4, by playing for example piano and kantele. Critically acclaimed for its vocals and successful combination of ballads and pop, though criticized for lack of peculiarity and a somewhat inconsistent song selection, Seili spent 62\u00a0non-consecutive weeks on the Finnish Albums Chart since its release\u2014with 15\u00a0weeks atop the chart\u2014and sold over 95,000\u00a0copies in 2010, becoming the best-selling album of 2010 in Finland. Altogether, Seili has sold over 150,000\u00a0copies since its release and currently ranks 14th in the list of the best-selling albums of all time in Finland. The album received three Emma Awards in February\u00a02011: for Album of the Year, Pop/Rock Album of the Year and Best-Selling Album of the Year. The album included also two Emma-winning songs, the gold-selling singles \"En haluu kuolla t\u00e4n\u00e4 y\u00f6n\u00e4\" and \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\", winning in the categories Song of the Year and Music Video of the Year, respectively. \"Nettiin\" was released as the third single and the album spawned two promotional singles, \"Duran Duran\", which sold also gold, and \"Eik\u00f6 kukaan voi meit\u00e4 pelastaa?\". \"Miss\u00e4 muruseni on\" was the major chart hit, dominating the top-three spots of the Finnish Singles Chart from August\u00a02010 to January\u00a02011 and becoming the third-best-selling single of 2011 in Finland. To promote the album, Vartiainen embarked on a concert tour titled Seili, spanning from April\u00a02010 to August\u00a02011 and consisting of 170\u00a0shows."

Flores recorded songs written by Jorge Drexler, Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, Alberto Moraga and herself. The album lead single, \"C\u00f3mo Quieres Que Te Quiera\", features the participation of Raimundo Amador playing guitar and Luis Dulzaines on percussion. The release of the album was named \"the return of Rosario,\" since critics and public rejected her previous album, Jugar a la Locura (1999), a Rock-infused album. Muchas Flores proved to be a success, selling 250,000 units in Spain, aided by the singer exposure on Talk to Her, a 2002 film by Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Flores also did a small promotional tour in the United States to benefit the album, and a full length worldwide tour, which lasted two years and concluded with the recording of her following album De Mil Colores. Muchas Flores received mixed critical reviews. Chris Nickson of AllMusic gave the album 2 stars out of 5. Nickson named Flores an \"excellent singer\", with the album starting with a raw flamenco yell and flourish, but quickly becomes straight forward Latin pop without \"too many sparks flying.\""

It was recorded from July to October 2000 in New York City and featured re-recordings of songs Bowie recorded between 1964 and 1971, along with a couple of new tracks. The project was co-produced by Bowie and Mark Plati and featured musicians from Bowie's then-touring band\u2014Plati, Earl Slick, Gail Ann Dorsey, Mike Garson and Sterling Campbell\u2014with overdubs from Lisa Germano, Gerry Leonard and Cuong Vu. Bowie's intention for the project was to rehearse the tracks, record them live and release them as quickly as possible, predating the idea of the surprise album. Intended for release in March 2001, the album was shelved by EMI/Virgin due to financial struggles, leading Bowie to depart the label and begin work on his next album Heathen (2002). Various Toy tracks saw release as B-sides and bonus tracks in the ensuing years; two were remade for Heathen and two appeared on the Nothing Has Changed compilation in 2014. Different mixes of the Toy tracks leaked onto the Internet in 2011, which caught media attention. Ten years later, Warner Music Group announced on 29 September 2021 that Toy would get an official release as part of the box set Brilliant Adventure (1992\u20132001) on 26 November 2021, through Bowie's own ISO label and Parlophone. A separate deluxe edition, featuring previously unseen photographs, alternate mixes, proposed B-sides and 13 new remixes of the tracks, was released on 7 January 2022. The official release received positive reviews from music critics, with many highlighting Bowie's vocal performances. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number five on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Bowie's 35th UK top 10 album."

The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, but it is also remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex."

After its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), The Raid received positive reviews from critics. The name of the film was changed to The Raid: Redemption in the United States as distributor Sony Pictures Classics could not secure the rights to the title; it also allowed Evans to plan out future titles in the series. The US release of the film features a film score composed by Mike Shinoda and Joseph Trapanese. It was released in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 14 August 2012. A sequel, The Raid 2, was released in 2014. Both films showcase the traditional Indonesian martial art of Pencak Silat, with fight choreography led by Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. A third film was considered but Evans decided not to go forward with the project."

The album contains many of Iwan Fals most popular songs, and contains mostly wistful ballads, but also the lively country and western-style Guru Oemar Bakri and blackly comic 'Ambulance Zig Zag'. Iwan Fals' early influence from Bob Dylan is evident in the richly descriptive documentary lyrics, and also in the heavy use of harmonica. The album also features country-style banjo and violin."

A port for Microsoft Windows was later released in November 2015. Lost World focuses on the efforts of Sonic the Hedgehog to stop the Deadly Six, an alien tribe that serves as the game's main antagonists, as they seek to siphon energy from the Lost Hex, the game's setting. Sonic and his long-time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman, normally their enemy, to stop the Deadly Six, leading to conflicts among the three parties. While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways, it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways. The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors as power-ups. The game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors. It was designed to be streamlined and fluid in movement and design, using tube-like level design and a simple, bright color scheme. The game received mixed reviews upon release; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized, but its visuals and audio were seen positively. Downloadable content was released both alongside and after the game's release, adding features such as additional levels and a new type of Wisp power."

        "content": "(The Return of Tobias) is an oratorio in two parts composed in 1775 by Joseph Haydn (Hob. XXI:1). The work is the first oratorio the composer wrote and, according to Jones, was \"his most extended and ambitious composition up to that time\". The Italian-language libretto of the work is by , brother of the composer Luigi Boccherini. This libretto is harshly criticized by Olleson, who notes that the author de-dramatizes vivid episodes in the source (the story of Tobit in the Apocrypha), depriving Haydn of the opportunity for highly dramatic musical utterance. The work was premiered in Vienna on 2 April 1775, under the sponsorship of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, a musician's benevolent society. The musical forces were substantial: Smither writes: \"characteristic of the large forces used for the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t concerts, the orchestra, chorus, and soloists possibly numbered more than 180 performers.\" He adds that the premiere was \"enormously successful.\" In 1784, Haydn substantially revised the work, with cuts to make numbers shorter and new choruses, for another of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t's benefit concerts. It is thought that at this concert Haydn first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who became his good friend. One of the soprano soloists was Nancy Storace, also a friend of Haydn, who later was Mozart's first Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. In 1808 the oratorio made a third appearance on the program of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, this time in a revised version by the now-elderly composer's pupil, Sigismund Neukomm. The performance on the night of 22 December, which required the labors of most of the highly qualified musicians in Vienna, had regrettable consequences for a now-famous rival concert taking place in Vienna on the same evening, the benefit for Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. Today, Il ritorno di Tobia is eclipsed by Haydn's later works in this genre \u2013 The Creation and The Seasons \u2013 and is seldom performed or recorded."

It was aired for the first time on 27 July 2013 on Channel 4, in conjunction with Pulse Films and One Little Indian Records. Partly filmed at the Natural History Museum in London, the documentary features an encounter between Icelandic singer-songwriter and musician Bj\u00f6rk and English broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough. They discuss the nature of music and the intersection between music, nature and technology. It also follows the singer as she prepares for her Biophilia Tour, along with rehearsal and studio recording. The documentary was inspired by the singer's eighth studio album Biophilia (2011), which was released as a series of apps which blends nature elements with musicology. Collaborators in the project Scott Snibbe, Damian Taylor, and Andy Cavatorta appear in the documentary to talk about their role in the development of the album and the live show. It also includes neurologist Oliver Sacks, who talks about the effect of music on the brain. Despite the low ratings, the show received positive to moderate reviews from critics, who applauded the content of the documentary but, in some cases, criticised the interaction between Attenborough and Bj\u00f6rk, which was considered \"awkward\" and \"unlikely\". The documentary was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 5 May 2014."
