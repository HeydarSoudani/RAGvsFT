        "content": "Perth () is the capital and largest city of the Australian state of Western Australia (WA). It is the fourth most populous city in Australia and Oceania, with a population of 2.1 million (80% of the state) living in Greater Perth in 2020. Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with most of the metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp. The city has expanded outward from the original British settlements on the Swan River, upon which the city's central business district and port of Fremantle are situated. Perth is located on the traditional lands of the Whadjuk Noongar people, where Aboriginal Australians have lived for at least 38,000 years. Captain James Stirling founded Perth in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony. It was named after the city of Perth in Scotland, due to the influence of Stirling's patron Sir George Murray, who had connections with the area. It gained city status in 1856, although the Perth City Council currently governs only a small area around the central business district. The city's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century. It has grown steadily since World War II due to a high net migration rate. Post-war immigrants were predominantly from Britain and Southern Europe, while more recent arrivals have led to a large population of Asian descent. Several mining booms in other parts of Western Australia in the late 20th and early 21st centuries saw Perth become the regional headquarters for large mining operations. Perth contains a number of important public buildings as well as various historic sites. Notable government buildings include Parliament House, Government House, the Supreme Court Buildings and the Perth Mint. The city is served by Fremantle Harbour and Perth Airport. It was a naval base for the Allies during World War II and the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Base West is located on Garden Island. All five of Western Australia's universities are based in Perth. The city has been ranked as one of the world's most liveable cities, and was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2020 as a Beta global city. , Perth is divided into 30 local government areas and consists of more than 350 suburbs. The metropolitan boundaries stretch  from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the south, and  east inland to The Lakes. Outside of the central business district, important urban centres within the metropolitan area include Armadale, Fremantle, Joondalup, Midland, and Rockingham. Most of those were originally established as separate settlements and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area. Mandurah, Western Australia's second-largest city, forms a conurbation with Perth along the coast, though for most purposes it is still considered a separate city."

The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland.  Although humans occupied the area since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka area.  The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has persisted to the present. Fukuoka is the most populous city on the island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated on April 1, 1972, by government ordinance. Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5\u00a0million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily industrialized Fukuoka\u2013Kitakyushu zone. , Fukuoka is Japan's sixth largest city, having passed the population of Kobe.

It played an important role in Greek myths, as the site of the stories of Cadmus, Oedipus, Dionysus, Heracles and others. Archaeological excavations in and around Thebes have revealed a Mycenaean settlement and clay tablets written in the Linear B script, indicating the importance of the site in the Bronze Age. Thebes was the largest city of the ancient region of Boeotia and was the leader of the Boeotian confederacy. It was a major rival of ancient Athens, and sided with the Persians during the 480 BC invasion under Xerxes.  Theban forces under the command of Epaminondas ended Spartan hegemony at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, with the Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite military unit of male lovers celebrated as instrumental there.  Macedonia would rise in power at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, bringing decisive victory to Philip II over an alliance of Thebes and Athens.   Thebes was a major force in Greek history prior to its destruction by Alexander the Great in 335 BC, and was the most dominant city-state at the time of the Macedonian conquest of Greece. During the Byzantine period, the city was famous for its silks. The modern city contains an archaeological museum, the remains of the Cadmea (Bronze Age and forward citadel), and scattered ancient remains. Modern Thebes is the largest town of the regional unit of Boeotia."

        "content": "Calais ( ,  , traditionally  , ; ; ) is a city and major ferry port in Northern France in the Pas-de-Calais department, of which it is a subprefecture. Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's prefecture is its third-largest city of Arras. The population of the city proper is 73,911; that of the urban area is 128,931 (2017). Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only  wide here, and is the closest French town to England.  The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais.  Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail. Due to its position, Calais since the Middle Ages has been a major port and a very important centre for transport and trading with England. Calais came under English control after Edward III of England captured the city in 1347, followed by a treaty in 1360 that formally assigned Calais to English rule.  Calais grew into a thriving centre for wool production, and came to be called the \"brightest jewel in the English crown\" owing to its great importance as the gateway for the tin, lead, lace and wool trades (or \"staples\"). Calais remained under English control until its capture by France in 1558. The town was virtually razed to the ground during World War II, when in May 1940, it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took the town during the siege of Calais.  During World War II, the Germans built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles at England. The old part of the town, Calais proper (known as Calais-Nord), is situated on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south and south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy of Calais. Arguably, it is the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France. In this church, former French President Charles de Gaulle married his wife, Yvonne Vendroux. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the H\u00f4tel-de-ville (the town hall), and the belfry from the early 20th century. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10\u00a0million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the lace industry for which the town is also famed."

Both town and park were founded by a syndicate led by prominent Denver brewer Adolph Zang, who endeavored to build the resort just across the county line from Denver, and incorporated to move beyond the reach of Denver liquor laws. A shopping mall, Lakeside Center, was built in 1956 on the southern shore, but fell into financial troubles due to lack of business around the turn of the century and was converted into a Wal-Mart and strip mall circa 2010.

A total of 68 medals (23 gold, 23 silver, 22 bronze) were awarded. In many countries, due in part to the conflation of the Olympic Games and the World's Fair in Paris, the media discussed only the athletics events under the \"Olympic\" name while ignoring the incredible variety of other sports featured at the time. The 23 events listed are those currently considered to have been of Olympic stature by the International Olympic Committee and most Olympic historians.  They exclude all events that used a handicap system, as well as all events which were open to professional athletes. The IOC has never decided which events were \"Olympic\" and which were not. Competitions were held on 14 July, 15 July, 16 July, 19 July, and 22 July.  This included Bastille Day, which is a French holiday, and then Sunday, which many of the American athletes protested.  Even with many Americans not competing in finals because of confusion caused by the organizers' decision to count scores achieved on Monday, 16 July for finals held on Sunday, 15 July and subsequent rescission of that decision, the United States won more than 4 times as many medals as any other nation, including 16 of the 23 gold medals. The conditions of competition were also subpar compared even to those at the previous games in 1896.  There was no track for the Paris Games, as a grass field dotted with trees and of unequal elevation was used.  The course was 500 metres in length, an unusual distance for a track."

It became a state under the First Brazilian Republic in 1889. Most of the state is tropical jungle; cities are clustered along navigable waterways and are accessible only by boat or plane.

Established before the state of Belgium itself, the university was founded by the Dutch King William I in 1817, when the region was incorporated into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands after the fall of First French Empire. In that same year, he founded two other universities for the southern provinces as well, alongside the University of Ghent: University of Li\u00e8ge and State University of Leuven. After the Belgian revolution of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer Ghent University. In 1930, UGent became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. Previously, French (and, even earlier, Latin) had been the standard academic language in what was Universit\u00e9 de Gand. In 1991, it was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from State University of Ghent (, abbreviated as RUG) to its current designation. Located in Flanders, Ghent is one of the largest Belgian universities, consisting of 44,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The University also supports the University Library (including the famous Boekentoren) and the University Hospital, which is one of the biggest hospitals in Belgium. It is one of the greatest beneficiaries of funding from the Flemish research council. An avowedly research-driven and socially minded university, UGent consistently rates among the top 100 universities in the world ."

It consisted of three separate treaties between England and each of its opponents in the Second Anglo-Dutch War: the Dutch Republic, France, and Denmark\u2013Norway. It also included a separate Anglo-Dutch commercial agreement. Negotiations had been in progress since late 1666 but were slow, as both sides tried to improve their positions. This changed after the French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in late May, which the Dutch viewed as a more serious threat. War-weariness in England was increased by the June Raid on the Medway. Both factors led to a rapid agreement of terms. Prior to 1667, the Anglo-Dutch relationship had been dominated by commercial conflict, which the treaty did not end entirely. However, tensions decreased markedly and cleared the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. With the brief anomaly of the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War, the treaty marked the beginning of an alliance between the English and the Dutch that would last for a century."

The Knox Private Hospital, Westfield Knox shopping centre, and Kieran are located in Wantirna. The EastLink tollway runs through Wantirna with interchanges at Boronia Road and Burwood Highway. Wantirna was first settled by Australians of European descent in 1840 when Mrs. Madeline Scott established the \"Bushy Park\" cattle run on the banks of the Dandenong Creek. During the 1870s other pioneers opened up the area to settlement. In 1912 the need for a school to serve the local area soon became apparent in this small but fast-growing area; the Finger family donated two acres of land on the southern side of Mountain Hwy (then known as Wantirna-Sassafras Rd) and a timber schoolhouse was opened. The Finger and Fankhauser families were prime movers in the erection of the Methodist Church opened opposite the school in May 1914, and a parish hall was built on Burwood Highway in 1924. Wantirna Post Office opened on 1 November 1913, closed in 1977, and reopened in 1983. The Wantirna Reserve was provided by the council in 1925 and a tennis court was built there shortly afterwards. In December 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, West Prussia Road was renamed Wantirna Road. Locations in Wantirna, especially Westfield Knox, are occasionally used to shoot the soap opera Neighbours.

Fleetwood acquired its modern character in the 1830s, when the principal landowner Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, High Sheriff and MP, conceived an ambitious plan to re-develop the town to make it a busy seaport and railway spur. He commissioned the distinguished Victorian architect Decimus Burton to design a number of substantial civic buildings, including two lighthouses. Hesketh-Fleetwood's transport terminus schemes failed to materialise. The town expanded greatly in the first half of the 20th century with the growth of the fishing industry, and passenger ferries to the Isle of Man, to become a deep-sea fishing port. Decline of the fishing industry began in the 1960s, hastened by the Cod Wars with Iceland, though fish processing is still a major economic activity in Fleetwood. The town's most notable employer today is Lofthouse of Fleetwood, manufacturer of the lozenge Fisherman's Friend which is exported around the world."

        "content": "The Walters Art Museum, located in Mount Vernon-Belvedere, Baltimore, Maryland, United States, is a public art museum founded and opened in 1934. It holds collections established during the mid-19th century. The Museum's collection was amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors, a father and son: William Thompson Walters, (1819\u20131894), who began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Southern/Confederate sympathizer at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861; and Henry Walters (1848\u20131931), who refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction of a later landmark building to rehouse it. After allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father's and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place townhouse/mansion during the late 1800s, he arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure built for that purpose in 1905\u20131909. Located across the back alley, a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street. The mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the  Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death, Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22,000 works, the original Charles Street Gallery building, and his adjacent townhouse/mansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore, \"for the benefit of the public.\" The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master European and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, Art Deco jewelry, and ancient Near East, Mesopotamian, or ancient Middle East items. In 2000, \"The Walters Art Gallery\" changed its long-time name to \"The Walters Art Museum\" to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year, \"The Walters\" (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies. Starting on October 1, 2006, the museum was enabled to make admission free to all, year-round, as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities.  In 2012, \"The Walters\" released nearly 20,000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license, and collaborated in  their upload to the world-wide web and the Internet on Wikimedia Commons. This was one of the largest and most comprehensive such releases made by any museum."

The medieval settlements in the parish were Stubhampton and Gunville. The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, is on the edge of Tarrant Gunville. It is on the site of an earlier building which probably dated from around 1100. The present building has a south porch, aisles and tower arch that are partly 14th-century, and a 15th-century west tower that was partly rebuilt in the 16th century, but the chancel and nave were rebuilt in 1843. The architect of the rebuilding was Thomas Henry Wyatt. Eastbury House, the surviving part of a much larger house designed by John Vanbrugh and built between 1717 and 1738, stands just east of Tarrant Gunville village. The larger part of the house was demolished in 1782. The grounds still display evidence of the original gardens, designed by Charles Bridgeman. It is probable that several of the ashlar and flint houses in the village were built using material taken from the demolished house. The photographer Thomas Wedgwood moved into the surviving part of Eastbury in 1800; his brother, the potter Josiah, had bought nearby Gunville House in 1799, shortly after its construction. The modern village hall was completed in 2001. There are 23 structures in the parish that are listed by English Heritage for their special historical or architectural interest.

Originally built based on the model of upscale American suburbs, today it is considered one of the most affluent neighborhoods of Tehran. It is one of the largest districts of Tehran, including easy access to expressways including Chamran Expressway, Hemmat Expressway, Niayesh Expressway, Sheikh Fazl-allah Nouri Expressway, and Yadegar-e-Emam Expressway, proximity to four major hospitals, as well as three large and famous shopping centers, numerous parks, cinema and cultural centers, police and fire stations, and post offices. Around 1980s, there was only one central shopping center there, named B\u0101z\u0101r\u010de (\"mini-bazaar\"). Construction of the Golestan Shopping Center began a few years after the Iran\u2013Iraq War. It was designed by Jordan Gruzen Architects in 1978 and built by another American company by the name Starrett, although some sections were never completed. Today, several modern shopping centers including Golestan, Iran Zamin, and Milad-e-Noor are located in this area. The tallest tower of Iran, Milad Tower, which stands 435m high from base to tip of the antenna, is located just outside the district. An international school is located nearby, within the town, and a second is minutes away in Sa'adat Abad. Because of the eastward current of the air in Tehran and its constant purification by the adjacent mountains, this town is less polluted compared to other northern parts of the city. These and many more advantages have made this area a prime and pleasant location for living, attracting many foreign temporary residents, diplomats and expatriates."

        "content": "Callowhill is a neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is roughly located in the vicinity of Callowhill Street, between Vine Street, Spring Garden Street, Broad Street, and 8th Street. It is named for Hannah Callowhill Penn, William Penn's second wife.  Callowhill was formerly home to large-scale manufacturing and other industries, of which an architectural history has been left in the form of grand old abandoned factories. During the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Callowhill plummeted, and although numbers are rising, it is a fairly unpopulated section of the city compared to surrounding neighborhoods. Recently developers have started to employ adaptive reuse projects, converting them into loft style housing; so much so that many have termed the neighborhood \"The Loft District\". In 2010 the Callowhill Industrial Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Callowhill is physically cut off from its neighbor to the south, Chinatown, by the Vine Street Expressway. This has largely prevented Chinese businesses from spreading north, although some industrial and storage uses by the Chinese community have been placed in Callowhill. Vine Street is also blamed for the abrupt drop in pedestrian life above Chinatown, and the struggle faced by efforts to redevelop this section of the city that lies between Center City and North Philadelphia. The former Reading Railroad train trestle, the Reading Viaduct, is a defining feature of the Callowhill neighborhood. Neighborhood groups have proposed that the abandoned structure be maintained as a public park. The Reading Viaduct park plan gained momentum in 2009 when Philadelphia's Center City District (CCD), and its influential president Paul Levy, became enamored of the idea and ultimately became a partner to help manage the project. CCD announced on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 that the first phase of the quarter-mile-long, elevated park would open in spring 2018. The actual grand opening of The Rail park was held on June 14, 2018, attracting a large crowd. Philadelphia Traffic Court is in Callowhill, at Spring Garden Street and North 8th Street."

Then he speaks of a later extension to the river Garigliano, to include the Volsci, Osci and Ausones. The \"last town\" in the Adiectum Latium, or \"Extension of Latium\", was Sinuessa. Pliny's remarks concerning Latium are part of his description of Italy: ...a land which is at once the nurseling and the mother of all other lands, chosen by providence of the gods to make heaven itself more glorious, to unite scattered empires, to make manners gentle, to draw together in converse by community of language the jarring and uncouth tongues of so many nations, to give mankind civilization, and in a word to become throughout the world the single fatherland of all the races. After waxing yet more eloquent concerning Italy \u2014 he was in fact north Italian himself, rather than Roman \u2014 he then gives: an account of a circuit of Italy, and of its cities. Herein it is necessary to premise that we intend to follow the authority of his late Majesty Augustus, and to adopt the division that he made of the whole of Italy into eleven regions ...

It was established by an Act of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1691, when each county in the Virginia Colony was directed set aside  of land for a town. Storehouses were to be built for products imported and tobacco to be exported. It was ordered that the county sell half-acre lots for its citizens to inhabit the town. It was located at the mouth of Gray's Creek at the James River across and somewhat downstream from Jamestown. It was probably named for Cobham, in Surrey, England. Cobham was active during the 18th and early 19th centuries, but eventually became one of the Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia. According to the Surry County Historical Society, \"today there is little evidence of the town, which became mostly farmland.\" The society reports that \"farmers, while plowing the fields, have run into old foundations, as well as finding locks, broken china, and even a long-barreled pistol.\" There is also a Cobham in eastern Albemarle County, Virginia.  It is located at the intersection of Route 22 (Louisa Road) and Route 640 (St. John's Road / Cobham Station Lane), roughly halfway between Charlottesville and Louisa.  The unincorporated community consists of horse farms and homes.  Cobham had a train station until the early 20th Century, and one building remains next to the train tracks, thought to have been a feed store.  The old train station building was moved to another site near Gordonsville where it is used as a home.  The original one-story general store near the tracks was moved about two hundred feet up to Route 22, and with the addition of a two-story building in 1936, served as the Cobham General Store and Post Office until the mid-1990s.  After serving other purposes, such as a tack store and internet business, the building was converted to a home in 2002."

The western terminus is west of York, and the eastern terminus is east of Lancaster. At both ends, PA 462 terminates at U.S. Route 30 (US 30), which follows a mostly freeway alignment parallel to the north between York and Lancaster. The route heads east into York, where it follows the one-way pair of Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In York, PA 462 runs concurrent with PA 74 and crosses Interstate 83 Business (I-83 Bus.). East of York, the route becomes a multilane road that has an interchange with I-83 and crosses PA 24. PA 462 continues east through Hallam to Wrightsville and passes through that town before it crosses the Susquehanna River and runs through Columbia. East of here, the route continues through Mountville before reaching the city of Lancaster. In Lancaster, PA 462 is routed on the one-way pair of King Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound, with the westbound direction concurrent with PA 23. The route crosses US 222/PA 272 and northbound PA 72 in Lancaster. East of Lancaster, PA 462 becomes a multilane road again and continues to its eastern terminus. The section of the current route east of Lancaster was built as a turnpike called the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in 1794, which headed east to Philadelphia. By 1796, a road continued west from Lancaster across the Susquehanna River to York. The state took over the turnpike in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1913, the road between York and Lancaster was incorporated into the Lincoln Highway, an auto trail that ran from San Francisco east to New York City. The Lincoln Highway through Pennsylvania became PA 1 in 1924. US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 west of Philadelphia in 1926, with the PA 1 designation removed two years later. US 30 was widened into a multilane road between York and Lancaster in the 1930s. The route was moved to one-way pairs in Lancaster in the 1930s, following King Street eastbound and Orange Street westbound, and York in the 1950s, following Market Street eastbound and Philadelphia Street westbound. In 1967, US 30 was moved to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster, with the former alignment becoming PA 462. US 30 was realigned to a freeway between York and Columbia in 1972 and PA 462 was extended west along the former alignment to west of York. In the 1970s, westbound PA 462 was moved from Orange Street to Walnut Street in Lancaster."

A marina, hotel, restaurants, condominiums and townhouses have now been built on Nanny Cay. It also holds a minor footnote in legal history, having been the subject of a receivership for over 12 years during the 1980s and 1990s, and is the longest ever receivership in the history of Barclays Bank PLC.  The current owners, Cameron McColl and John McCoach and Graeme Scott purchased it from Barclays. Today, Nanny Cay has a marina and boatyard which has berths for 180 motor cruisers and yachts and two boat lifts of 50 and 70 tons capacity with storage for 200 boats.  It also includes a 40-room hotel and new waterfront townhouses for purchase and rental, two restaurants, a small supermarket, shops and boutiques, a dive shop, a water sports center, and a gym and spa.

Negotiations for a new contract had spanned 18 months and officially ended with the exodus of Ford workers at 10 a.m. on the morning of September 12. The Strike included picketing and eventually led to a two-day blockade of vehicles surrounding the Ford plant on November 5. The strike ended on December 19 as both sides agreed to a temporary agreement proposal, while arbitration regarding the implementation of a fully unionized shop and medical coverage continued under Justice Ivan C. Rand. His report was released on January 29, 1946. The Rand Formula, as it became known, was one result of his report. This gave the UAW formal recognition as the sole negotiators representing all employees of Ford Motor Company. This changed both collective bargaining and labour relations by legitimizing unions."

        "content": "WNHI (106.5 FM) is a Christian Worship formatted radio station. Licensed to Farmington, New Hampshire, the station's transmitter is located in New Durham, and studios are located in Rochester. The station serves the Portsmouth, New Hampshire area, and is currently owned by Educational Media Foundation. The station signed on in 1999 with a deep oldies format as WZEN, competing with WQSO. WZEN adopted the WMEX letters shortly after they were dropped by what is now WQOM (1060 AM) in 2001. The WMEX call letters, which were also used during the 1980s on what is now WWDJ (1150 AM) in Boston as well as WCLX in Westport, NY in the Burlington, VT market, refer to a popular top-40 station of the 1960s and 1970s on 1510 AM in Boston, Massachusetts (which has since reclaimed the WMEX call sign). In 2005, the station adjusted to hot AC as \"X106\", but returned to a more mainstream oldies format as \"106.5 WMEX\". On January 28, 2008, AllAccess.com reported that the station was in the process of being sold to the Educational Media Foundation for $1 million. When the sale was finalized, the station had been expected to change call letters and become the first New Hampshire affiliate of EMF's K-LOVE Christian contemporary music network. On June 2, 2008, the station went out with the Righteous Brothers' \"Rock n Roll Heaven\" as its last tune. While the station changed its call letters to WKHL, implying that it would join K-LOVE, the station ended up joining sister network Air 1 instead. A few weeks later, the call sign was again changed, this time to the current WNHI. The WMEX call sign was subsequently assigned to a construction permit for a station at 88.7\u00a0MHz in Edgartown, MA (now WMVY), and is now used on WMEX-LP (105.9 FM) in Rochester and WMEX (1510 AM) in Boston."

It is named after Sir Thomas Roe, friend and sponsor of explorer Luke Fox's 1631 Arctic voyage. Capt. Parry, trying to find the Northwest Passage during his 1821 voyage, wrote: \"On an inspection of the charts, I think it will also appear probable that a communication will one day be found to exist between this inlet (Prince Regent's) and Hudson's Bay, either through the broad and unexplored channel called Sir Thomas Roe's Welcome, or through Repulse Bay, which has not yet been satisfactorily examined.\" Roes Welcome Sound is a bowhead whale migratory path."

A Bammel post office, at which Herman Kuehnle was the first postmaster, operated from 1916 until 1929. Bammel's store burned in 1927 but was later rebuilt to serve the new Bammel Forest subdivision. The town's population was reported as roughly fifty from 1929 until oil was discovered in the area in 1938. In 1943 the community reported two stores and a population of 200, but in 1949 its population was estimated at twenty. During the 1980s Bammel's residents were mainly commuters who worked in Houston.

In 1936 construction of an air field for the Luftwaffe was completed. However, no permanent buildings and structures were erected, indicating that there were no plans for a permanent air field. The base was used during World War II by several Luftwaffe units including night fighters. After the end of World War II  the air field was abandoned. Beginning in 1957 works started to convert the former air force base into an air base to house units of the recently formed German Army's Aviation Corps, utilising the facilities of the previous occupant. These final works were completed in 1962 after which numerous units were stationed at Niederstetten Air Base. Currently, the air base is home of Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 of the German Army. The regiment, which was relocated to Niederstetten in 1980, was part of German Army's Airmobile Operations Division, the division's headquarters being in Veitsh\u00f6chheim. The division was dissolved in 2014, and Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 was subsequently integrated into Rapid Forces Division. Approximately 750 members of the armed forces are at present employed at the air base. However, due to further restructuring within the German Army Aviation Corps this number was increased by 600 in 2011. Army Aviation Transport Helicopter Regiment 30 is equipped with helicopters of the type Bell UH-1D. These helicopters are being replaced by medium-sized NH90s, 32 of which will be stationed at Niederstetten Air Base. To accommodate the new aircraft an extensive building program started in 2007, the first result of which was the completion of a hangar to house 8 helicopters of the type NH90 in February 2008. The air base is also used for civilian purposes, particularly for business flights and recreational purposes. In order to comply with EU regulations and to retain permission for civilian use, the runway was extended by 200 metres in 2011. To accommodate the new aircraft an extensive building program started in 2007."

The US Congress passed the 1984 California Wilderness Act that set aside the Mount Shasta Wilderness. The US Forest Service is the managing agency  as the wilderness  is within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The area is named for and is dominated by the Mount Shasta volcano which reaches a traditionally quoted height of  above sea level, but official sources give values ranging from  from one USGS project, to  via the NOAA.  Mount Shasta is one of only two peaks in the state over  outside the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The other summit is White Mountain Peak in the Great Basin of east-central California. The Wintun Glacier is located on Mount Shasta and is the lowest-elevation glacier in the state, lying at  elevation and extending to the summit. The  smaller volcanic cone of Shastina (12,270\u00a0ft) lies one mile (1.6\u00a0km) west of Mount Shasta and was formed after the ice-age glaciers melted. The wilderness protects both pristine forests and areas that were intensively logged and roaded in the past. Although less than half of the mountain remains roadless,  Mount Shasta Wilderness is still the premier destination for a variety of activities from mountaineering, day-hiking, and  backpacking to cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and ski mountaineering. It is valued for the many scenic, geologic and recreational attributes including glaciers, lava flows, hot springs, waterfalls and forests of Shasta red fir, sugar pine and other conifers."

It is a -story gambrel-roofed brick house, laid in English bond. It has a traditional two-room plan with central hall. It still has original paneling in the west room and central hall. There were later twentieth-century additions to the house, of a -story wing and connecting hyphen. The creek side has a long screened porch. The property is also significant for its associations with Richard Bennett, Puritan governor of the Virginia colony from 1652 to 1655, during the reign of Oliver Cromwell. He had a plantation in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, as well as other properties. Also involved in the colony of Maryland, in 1665 Bennett patented 2500 acres on the north side of Wicomico Creek. His grant was large enough to be classified under the Maryland system as a manor. The property was bought in 1721 by George Dashiell (1690\u20131748) from one of Bennett's grandchildren; he patented 1740 acres after a re-survey. A wealthy planter, Dashiell is believed to have built the house that currently stands on the property. He served in the Lower House of the Assembly in 1724, 1745, and 1746. He attained the rank of Colonel in the Maryland militia by 1736. His family retained the property until 1791. Bennett's Adventure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975."

Although the mine closed in the mid 1960s' many of the buildings including the mill, 2 head-frames and some offices remained in place well into the 1990s.  Several of the offices were used by the Equestrian Club in the 1970s and 1980s.

The station is served by Rodalies de Catalunya regional line  and Girona commuter rail service line . The station has nine tracks and three platforms. Movement between platforms is via level crossings and an underground passage which consists of stairs that are not wheelchair accessible. The two main platforms have canopies that partly cover the passenger waiting areas. On the left side of the tracks, facing Portbou, is the main passenger building with two floors. The ground floor has the lobby with ticket offices (both staffed and electronic), customer lounge, kiosk, and a cafeteria. Opened in 1877, Figueres station has an uncertain future due to the arrival of the high-speed line at a new station called Figueres-Vilafant. Officially called a \"provisional station\", it is far from the centers of either Figueres or Vilafant. The only car parking available is in an enclosed, paid lot.  The current plan calls for moving all train service for Figueres to this new station and to close the old station, although this has been met with a great deal of opposition."

Built in 1915, it is a two-story brick structure with a prominent cornice. From 1917 to the mid-1960s the building was the headquarters of the Albuquerque Gas & Electric Company, which later became the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM). During this period the piers and cornice of the building were decorated with hundreds of electric light bulbs, the sockets for which are still in place. PNM later moved two blocks south to the PNM Building on Silver Avenue. The property was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1981 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

It was abolished in the 2011 census, along with the other census division of Fort Smith Region, and the land area of the Northwest Territories was divided into new census divisions named Region 1, Region 2, Region 3, Region 4, Region 5, Region 6. It is not to be confused with the modern-day Inuvik Region administrative region, which is smaller. The administrative region coincides territorially with modern-day census division Region 1; the census division included all of the modern-day Region 1 as well as a part of Region 2. For example, the border of the former Inuvik and Fort Smith census divisions ran through the middle of Great Bear Lake, but the lake is entirely outside of the Inuvik administrative region. The communities of Norman Wells, Colville Lake and Fort Good Hope were part of the census division, but not the administrative region. It comprised the northern and western part of the Northwest Territories, with its main economic centre in the town of Inuvik. The 2006 census reported a population of 9,192 and a land area of .  This represented about 23 percent of the population and about 46 percent of the land area of the Northwest Territories."

It subsequently underwent several modernizations, most recently in 1512, which were paid for by Queen Joanna of Castile. It is rectangular in shape, measuring  north-south and  east-west. The castle's original name, \"tower of the snake\", and the fact that it had seven towers, led to the current name of the city and its coat of arms. In 1963, the Ministry of Culture declared the site a Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural monument. Currently, its courtyard is used as a cultural space, which is in the process of being cataloging, restored and reconstructed.

The infrastructure of \"traditional\" crops is affected, but that is where the widespread use of hydroponic crops is relevant; the main concern with them is actually cost, since indoor structures should be safe from nature. Experts from the University of Puerto Rico argued that these crops could cover approx. 30% of the local demand, particularly that of smaller vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce, etc. and several kinds of tubers that are currently being imported, opening the door to eventual exportation. The existence of a thriving agricultural economy has been prevented due to a shift in priorities towards industrialization, bureaucratization, mismanagement of terrains, lack of alternative methods and a deficient workforce. Its geographical location within the Caribbean exacerbates these issues, making the scarce existing crops propense to the devastating effects of Atlantic hurricanes."

The hotel opened in 1883 and was operated jointly by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and London and North Western Railway. In the 1923 grouping of railway companies, ownership passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. When the UK's railways were nationalised in 1948, it passed to the British Transport Commission's Hotels Executive, and thence to British Transport Hotels, who sold it in 1950. It has subsequently been, and as of September 2014 remains, used as offices, and renamed \"East Cliff County Offices\", by Lancashire County Council, who also had a modern annexe, adjacent. Located on a small hill, the red-brick building overlooks Preston railway station, on the West Coast Main Line, to its north-west and Miller Park and the River Ribble to its south-east. In its heyday, the hotel was connected to the southern end of the main south-bound platform (the modern-day platform 4) at Preston station by a covered footbridge Various pre-1923 objects from the hotel are in the National Railway Museum at York. These include Mappin & Webb cutlery and Elkington & Co. tableware and candlesticks, the latter marked with the initials \"P.P.\" and a lamb and flag, the coat of arms of the city. The historic hotel structure was used for many decades as an office building for the Lancashire County Council, along with an adjoining tower, constructed in the 1960s. In 2020, the modern office tower was demolished as part of a plan by the Council to restore the hotel to operation."

        "content": "Nelsonville (formerly Newell and Imlaystown Station) is an unincorporated community located within Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. The settlement is located on County Route 526 between Allentown and Imlaystown where it intersects the former Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad. The site was the location of the Newell post office established in 1883 (removed in 1923). The area was originally known as Imlaystown Station as it was the closest spot to the eponymous town along the railroad. In 1887, the area was renamed to Nelsonville for the local postmaster, Charles Nelson. Other industries in the area at the time included a wagon shop and a cider mill. Today, several agricultural and light industries surround the settlement in addition to some single-family homes. The right-of-way of the former railroad is being reconstructed as the Union Transportation Trail."
