        "content": "Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, software and online services. Apple is the largest information technology company by revenue (totaling  in 2021) and, as of January 2021, it is the world's most valuable company, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial success. The company went onto develop new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, \"1984\", directed by Ridley Scott. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him. As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook. Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1\u00a0trillion in August 2018, then $2\u00a0trillion in August 2020, and most recently $3\u00a0trillion in January 2022. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. The company enjoys a high level of brand loyalty, and is ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands."

        "title": "Esperanto_Summary",
        "content": "Esperanto ( or ) is the world's most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language. Created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, it was intended to be a universal second language for international communication, or \"the international language\" (). Zamenhof first described the language in Dr. Esperanto's International Language (Unua Libro), which he published in five languages (Russian, Polish, French, German and English) under the pseudonym \"\"; the English version was almost immediately replaced, with Zamenhof's blessing, by one by Richard H. Geoghegan, and an Esperanto version, not part of the \"five original languages\", came soon afterwards. The word  translates into English as \"one who hopes.\" Zamenhof claimed that the grammar of the language could be learned in one hour, though this estimate assumed a learner with a background in European languages. Within the range of constructed languages, Esperanto occupies a middle ground between \"naturalistic\" (imitating existing natural languages) and apriori (where features are not based on existing languages). Although Esperanto's vocabulary, syntax, and semantics derive predominantly from Standard Average European languages of the Indo-European group, its grammar is highly regular when compared to these languages, and as such it is considered an easy language to learn. The vocabulary derives primarily from Romance languages, with substantial contributions from Germanic languages. One of the language's most notable features is its extensive system of derivation, where prefixes and suffixes may be freely combined with roots to generate words, making it possible to communicate effectively with a smaller set of words. Esperanto is the most successful international auxiliary language and the only such language with a population of native speakers, of which there are perhaps several thousand. Usage estimates are difficult, but two recent estimates put the number of active speakers at around 100,000. Concentration of speakers is highest in Europe, East Asia, and South America. Although no country has adopted Esperanto officially,  (\"Esperanto-land\") is used as a name for the collection of places where it is spoken. The language has also gained a noticeable presence on the internet in recent years, as it became increasingly accessible on platforms such as Duolingo, Wikipedia and Google Translate. Esperanto speakers are often called \"Esperantists\" ()."

        "content": "The Replacements were an American rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1979. Initially a punk rock band, they are one of the main pioneers of alternative rock. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson and drummer Chris Mars for most of its existence. Following several acclaimed albums, including Let It Be and Tim, Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist. Steve Foley replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over the creative output. The group disbanded in 1991, with the members eventually pursuing various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012. The band is referred to by their nickname \"The 'Mats\" by fans, which originated as a truncation of \"The Placemats,\" a mispronunciation of their name. The Replacements' music was influenced by rock artists such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Faces, Big Star, Slade, Badfinger, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Bob Dylan as well as punk rock bands such as the Ramones, the New York Dolls, the Buzzcocks, the Damned, and the Sex Pistols. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played \"heart-on-the-sleeve\" rock songs that combined Westerberg's \"raw-throated adolescent howl\" with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material."

        "content": "Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in London in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid- seventies\". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100\u00a0million albums worldwide. Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976\u20131984). The 1968\u20131976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals) and Roger Glover (bass), who joined founder members Jon Lord (keyboards), Ian Paice (drums) and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals) (and Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the last original Deep Purple member still in the band. Deep Purple was ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme, and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale, Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016."

        "content": "Marillion  are  a British rock band, formed in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in 1979. They emerged from the post-punk music scene in Britain and existed as a bridge between the styles of punk rock and classic progressive rock, becoming the most commercially successful neo-progressive rock band of the 1980s. Marillion's recorded studio output since 1982 is composed of nineteen albums and generally regarded in two distinct eras, delineated by the departure of original lead singer Fish in late 1988 and the subsequent arrival of replacement Steve Hogarth in early 1989. The band achieved eight Top Ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, including a number one album in 1985 with Misplaced Childhood, and during the period the band were fronted by Fish they had eleven Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart. They are best known for the 1985 singles \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\", which reached number two and number five respectively, with \"Kayleigh\" also entering the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Marillion's first album released with Hogarth, 1989's Seasons End, was another Top Ten hit, and albums continued to chart well until their departure from EMI Records following the release of their 1996 live album Made Again and the dissipation of the band's mainstream popularity in the late 1990s; save for a resurgence in the mid- to late-2000s, they have essentially been a cult act since then. Marillion have achieved a further twelve Top 40 hit singles in the UK with Hogarth, including 2004's \"You're Gone\", which charted at No.\u00a07 and is the biggest hit of his tenure. Marillion continue to tour internationally, becoming ranked 38th in Classic Rock's \"50 Best Live Acts of All Time\" in 2008. In 2016, they returned to the UK Albums Chart Top Ten for the first time in 22 years with their highest chart placing since 1987. Despite unpopularity in the mainstream media and a consistently unfashionable status within the British music industry, Marillion have maintained a very loyal international fanbase, becoming widely acknowledged as playing a pioneering role in the development of crowdfunding and fan-funded music. They have sold over 15 million albums worldwide."

The band's lineup has changed multiple times over its -year career, most noticeably with their bassists and lead guitarists. Petrozza and Reil are the only two original members left in Kreator, although Reil took a brief hiatus from the band from 1994 to 1996. Yli-Sirni\u00f6 has been the lead guitarist of Kreator since 2001, while Leclercq joined in 2019 as the replacement of Christian \"Speesy\" Giesler, who had been a member of the band since 1994. To date, Kreator has released fourteen studio albums, two EPs, two live albums and three compilation albums. They gained a large underground fanbase in the international thrash metal community, with their second studio album Pleasure to Kill (1986) regarded as an influential album of the genre. Many of their subsequent albums \u2013 including Terrible Certainty (1987), Extreme Aggression (1989) and Coma of Souls (1990) \u2013 were also highly acclaimed. Despite being an influential band, as well as one of the first European thrash metal acts to sign to a major label (signing to Epic Records in 1988), Kreator would not achieve mainstream popularity until later albums, including their thirteenth studio album Phantom Antichrist (2012) and its follow-up Gods of Violence (2017), both of which charted highly in many countries, with the latter reaching number one on the German charts. Their latest studio album, Hate \u00dcber Alles, is due for release on June 3, 2022. The band has achieved worldwide sales of over two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them one of the best-selling German thrash metal bands of all time. Along with Destruction, Sodom and Tankard, Kreator is one of the \"big four\" of Teutonic thrash metal, responsible for developing and popularizing the German thrash metal scene as well as pioneering the then-burgeoning death metal and black metal genres during the mid-1980s."

The single was typical of the band's earlier career, characterized by synthesized instrumentation by Merritt, with lead vocals provided by Susan Anway (and then by Stephin Merritt himself, from the House of Tomorrow EP onwards). A more traditional band later materialized; it is now composed of Merritt, Claudia Gonson, Sam Davol, and John Woo, with occasional guest vocals by Shirley Simms. The band's best-known work is the 1999 three-volume concept album 69 Love Songs. It was followed in the succeeding years by a \"no-synth\" trilogy: i (2004), Distortion (2008), and Realism (2010).

Initially called Panic, the band was established by Greg Ginn, the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes in the band. They are widely considered to be one of the first hardcore punk bands, as well as one of the pioneers of  After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag reunited in 2003 and again in 2013. The second reunion lasted well over a year, during which they released their first studio album in over two decades, What The... (2013). The band announced their third reunion in January 2019. Brandon Pertzborn was replaced by Isaias Gil on drums and Tyler Smith was replaced by Joseph Noval on bass. Black Flag's sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and, in later years, frequent tempo shifts. The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and nonconformist message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia. These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's independent record label SST Records. Over the course of the 1980s, Black Flag's sound, as well as their notoriety evolved. As well as being central to the creation of hardcore punk, they were innovators in the first wave of American West Coast punk rock and are considered a key influence on punk subculture in the United States and abroad. Along with being among the earliest punk rock groups to incorporate elements and the influence of heavy metal melodies and rhythm, there were often overt free jazz and contemporary classical elements in their sound, especially in Ginn's guitar playing, and the band interspersed records and performances with instrumentals throughout their career. They also played longer, slower, and more complex songs at a time when other bands in their milieu performed a raw, fast, three-chord format. As a result, their extensive discography is more stylistically varied than many of their punk rock contemporaries. Black Flag has been well-respected within the punk subculture, primarily for their tireless promotion of an autonomous DIY punk ethic and aesthetic. They are often regarded as pioneers in the movement of underground do-it-yourself record labels that flourished among 1980s punk rock bands. Through constant touring throughout the United States and Canada, and occasionally Europe, Black Flag established a dedicated cult following."

The band released 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, \"That's Entertainment\" and \"Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?\" remain the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK. They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, The Gift, hit number one on the UK Albums Chart. When the group disbanded in 1982, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100. While the Jam shared the \"angry young man\" outlook and fast tempo of the mid-1970s British punk rock movement, in contrast with it the band wore smartly tailored suits reminiscent of English pop-bands in the early 1960s and incorporated mainstream 1960s rock and R&B influences into its sound, particularly from the Who's work of that period and also drew influence from the work of the Kinks and the music of American Motown. This placed the act at the forefront of the 1970s\u20131980s nascent Mod Revival movement. With many of the band's lyrics about working class life, Jam biographer Sean Egan commented that they \"took social protest and cultural authenticity to the top of the charts.\" The band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1960s beat music, soul, rhythm and blues and psychedelic rock, as well as 1970s punk and new wave. The trio were known for their melodic pop songs, their distinctly English flavour and their mod image. The band launched the career of Paul Weller, who went on to form the Style Council and later his solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of the Jam's original compositions and played lead guitar, using a Rickenbacker 330. Bruce Foxton provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band's songs, including the hits \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\", \"The Eton Rifles\", \"Going Underground\" and \"Town Called Malice\" mainly using a Rickenbacker 4001 or a Fender Precision Bass, as well as, on rare occasions, an Epiphone Rivoli."

In 2001, they announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers. The trio reunited two years later for the release of their fifth and final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled (2004), which spawned the international hits \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\".

The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often abandon recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative rock subgenre of dream pop. The band's early work drew influence from Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division. After signing with the British record label 4AD in 1982, they released their debut album Garlands later that year. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced their biggest hit in the UK, \"Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops\", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1988, Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, through a major label in the country. After the 1990 release of their most critically acclaimed album, Heaven or Las Vegas, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums. After nearly 20 years together, the band disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship. In 2005, the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser refused to perform on stage with Guthrie. In a 2021 interview, Raymonde confirmed that Cocteau Twins \"will never reform\"."

        "content": "The Frankfurt School () was a school of social theory and critical philosophy associated with the Institute for Social Research, at Goethe University Frankfurt in 1929. Founded in the Weimar Republic (1918\u20131933), during the European interwar period (1918\u20131939), the Frankfurt School comprised intellectuals, academics, and political dissidents dissatisfied with the contemporary socio-economic systems (capitalist, fascist, communist) of the 1930s. The Frankfurt theorists proposed that social theory was inadequate for explaining the turbulent political factionalism and reactionary politics occurring in 20th century liberal capitalist societies. Critical of both capitalism and of Marxism\u2013Leninism as philosophically inflexible systems of social organization, the School's critical theory research indicated alternative paths to realizing the social development of a society and a nation. The Frankfurt School perspective of critical investigation (open-ended and self-critical) is based upon Freudian, Marxist and Hegelian premises of idealist philosophy. To fill the omissions of 19th-century classical Marxism, which did not address 20th-century social problems, they applied the methods of antipositivist sociology, of psychoanalysis, and of existentialism. The School's sociologic works derived from syntheses of the thematically pertinent works of Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and Karl Marx, of Sigmund Freud and Max Weber, and of Georg Simmel and Georg Luk\u00e1cs. Like Karl Marx, the Frankfurt School concerned themselves with the conditions (political, economic, societal) that allow for social change realized by way of rational social institutions. Their emphasis on the critical component of social theory derived from their attempts to overcome the ideological limitations of positivism, materialism, and determinism by returning to the critical philosophy of Kant and his successors in German idealism \u2013 principally the philosophy of Hegel, which emphasized dialectic and contradiction as intellectual properties inherent to the human grasp of material reality. Since the 1960s, the critical-theory work of the Institute for Social Research has been guided by J\u00fcrgen Habermas's work in communicative rationality, linguistic intersubjectivity, and \"the philosophical discourse of modernity.\" Critical theorists Raymond Geuss and Nikolas Kompridis have opposed Habermas's propositions, claiming he has undermined the original social-change purposes of critical-theory-problems, such as what should reason mean; analysis of the conditions necessary to realize social emancipation; and critiques of contemporary capitalism."

The band has had more than 50 singles in the UK Singles Chart, and has also achieved considerable international success. They have been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album four times, and in 1984 were nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group. UB40 have sold over 70 million records worldwide. The ethnic make-up of the band's original line-up was diverse, with musicians of English, Welsh, Irish, Jamaican, Scottish, and Yemeni parentage. Their hit singles include their debut \"Food for Thought\" and two Billboard Hot 100 number ones with \"Red Red Wine\" and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". Both of these also topped the UK Singles Chart, as did the band's version of \"I Got You Babe\". Their two most successful albums, Labour of Love (1983) and Promises and Lies (1993), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. UB40 and the English ska band Madness hold the record for most weeks spent by a group in the UK singles chart during the 1980s, with 214 weeks each. The band's line-up was stable for nearly 29 years, from March 1979 until January 2008, when frontman Ali Campbell left the band, followed shortly thereafter by keyboardist Mickey Virtue. Another member, Astro, remained with the band until November 2013, when he departed the original band to team up with Campbell and Virtue in a new version of UB40. In 2014, legal advice was sought by the original band (now consisting of remaining co-founding members drummer Jimmy Brown, guitarist Robin Campbell, bassist Earl Falconer, percussionist Norman Hassan, and saxophonist Brian Travers, along with new vocalist Duncan Campbell) who took action against the group containing Campbell, Virtue, and Astro over usage of the band name, due to it being used by both parties.

Lawson in 1896, which set up its manufacturing base in Coventry. The company bought the right to the use of the Daimler name simultaneously from Gottlieb Daimler and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft of Cannstatt, Germany. After early financial difficulty and a reorganisation of the company in 1904, the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1910, which also made cars under its own name before the Second World War. In 1933, BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of Daimler Company. Daimler was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British monarch in 1902; it lost this privilege in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce. Daimler occasionally used alternative technology: the Knight engine which it further developed in the early twentieth century and used from 1909 to 1935, the worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after the Second World War, and their patented fluid flywheel used in conjunction with a Wilson preselector gearbox from 1930 to the mid-1950s. Daimler tried to widen its appeal in the 1950s with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other, stopped making Lanchesters, had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board, and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine. BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars in 1960 and Jaguar briefly continued Daimler's line adding a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon. Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1966 and British Leyland in 1968. Under these companies, Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the 1968\u20131992 Daimler DS420 limousine, which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar-based. When Jaguar Cars was split off from British Leyland in 1984 it retained the Daimler company and brand. Ford bought Jaguar Cars in 1990 and under Ford it stopped using the Daimler marque in 2009 when the last X358 Daimler models were discontinued. The X351 Jaguar XJ took its place and there was no Daimler variant. Jaguar Cars remained in its ownership, and from 2000 accompanied by Land Rover, until they sold both Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in 2008, who formed Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company for them. In 2013, Jaguar Cars was merged with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and the rights to the Daimler car brand were transferred to the newly formed British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover."

The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year, making up 70% of its total sales. Formed over 1,100 years ago, the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England, all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire. The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of London for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s. As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency, the Mint moved from London to a new  plant in Llantrisant, Glamorgan, Wales, where it has remained since. In 2009, after recommendations for the mint to be privatised, The Royal Mint ceased being an executive government agency and became a state-owned limited company wholly owned by HM Treasury.

Founded by lead singer and guitarist Tim Smith and his brother bassist Jim Smith, the group have cycled through over a dozen keyboardists, percussionists and saxophone players. They are noted for their complex, varied and intense compositional style and for their eccentric, theatrical stage shows. Hailed as an influence by bands as diverse as Blur, Faith No More and Napalm Death, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and post-punk in innovative ways; the band explored music styles ranging from circus music and nursery rhymes to psychedelia and experimental rock. Their music maintains a cult following and continues to influence modern avant-garde metal culture. In the late 1970s, Cardiacs established itself playing gigs in Surrey and London over three years from 1977, initially called the Filth and later Cardiac Arrest. They released three demo albums from 1980 to 1984. After creating their label Alphabet Business Concern in 1984, Cardiacs found unexpected mainstream success with \"Is This the Life?\", the re-recorded single from their debut studio album A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window (1988). Their line-up changed throughout this time, with their best-known lasting through On Land and in the Sea (1989) until Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992) comprising Tim Smith (guitar, lead vocals), Jim Smith (bass guitar, vocals), William D. Drake (keyboards, vocals), Sarah Smith (saxophone, vocals), Dominic Luckman (drums) and Tim Quy (marimba, percussion, synthesiser). Sarah left Cardiacs in 1989, though still appeared as a guest artist in later releases, and the band was joined by Christian Hayes, later replaced by Jon Poole. Luckman was replaced by Bob Leith on drums and, as a four-piece comprising T. Smith, J. Smith, Poole and Leith, the band produced the albums Sing to God (1996) and Guns (1999). In 2003, the band performed at The Garage in London with Kavus Torabi replacing Poole on guitar, resulting in the live album The Special Garage Concerts (2005). The last Cardiacs studio album, provisionally titled LSD, was recorded with an expanded line-up and has yet to be released. Keyboardist Colvin Mayers died of an AIDS-related disease in 1993, and Tim Smith died of a heart attack in 2020 after living with the rare neurological disorder dystonia for twelve years following a cardiopulmonary arrest in 2008. Many other members remain musically active. Cardiacs are noted for attracting strongly diverse responses: they remained one of Britain's leading cult rock bands during their four-decade-spanning career, but also attracted virulent critical attack (including a lengthy editorial ban from the British music magazine New Musical Express). Tim Smith received the honorary Doctor of Music degree in 2018 from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland for his work in the band, which Jim accepted on his behalf."

Their sound mixed a generally punk rock approach to vocals and sound textures with poppy tunes and strong musicianship. Although these three band members remained fairly constant, they went through numerous drummers, including Duff McKagan, later of Guns N' Roses. MTV's web page on the Fastbacks says that estimates at the number of Fastbacks drummers \"range from 12 to 20.\" For most of the band's last decade, Mike Musburger filled this role, but other Fastbacks drummers before him (or when he took occasional breaks) included Bloch himself, Richard Stuverud (perhaps best known from War Babies, Fifth Angel and his collaborations with Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament, including Three Fish, Tres Mts. and RNDM), Nate Johnson and Rusty Willoughby (both of whom also played in both Flop and Pure Joy), John Moen (of the Dharma Bums, later of Steven Malkmus's Jicks and The Decemberists), Jason Finn (of the Presidents of the United States of America), Dan Peters of Mudhoney, and Tad Hutchison of the Young Fresh Fellows. Several of these people also served at times as drummers in The Squirrels, a similarly long-lived band, and the Fastbacks' sometime label-mates on PopLlama Records, who bring a similar mix of strong musicianship and punk attitude to even poppier material. Contributing to the band's breakup was Kim Warnick's move to the band Visqueen in 2001 through 2004. In summer 2010 Kim Warnick started a new band with Mikey Davis (Alien Crime Syndicate, Tommy Stinson) called Cali Giraffes. The Fastbacks reunited for a one-off live performance 8 July 2011 at the West Seattle Summer Music Festival, featuring the core trio of Bloch, Warnick, and Garguilo, along with Mike Musburger on drums, their first official show together since their break-up a decade ago. They later reunited in September 2018 for a benefit concert, in aid of fellow Seattle musician Andrew McKeag."

The group was an offshoot of a large big band ensemble called the Tophatters. By the late 1940s, Turner had renamed this group the Kings of Rhythm. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits of the day. In 1951, Turner and his Kings of Rhythm recorded the song \"Rocket 88\" (credited to Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats),\" which is a contender for the first rock and roll record. The song is inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles. In the 1960s, the Kings of Rhythm became the band for the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. For a few years in the early 1970s they were renamed the Family Vibes, and released two albums under that name. After the disbanding of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in 1976, Turner revived the Kings of Rhythm in 2001 and released the Grammy-nominated album Here And Now. The Kings of Rhythm backed Turner on his Grammy-winning album Risin' With The Blues (2006). After Turner died in 2007, the band for some time was under the leadership of pianist Ernest Lane, who was a childhood friend of Turner's.

The band are known for their interest in traditional Indian music, culture, and mysticism, with a number of their most famous songs, including \"Tattva\" and \"Govinda\", featuring lyrics written in Sanskrit. The name Kula Shaker was itself inspired by king Kulasekhara, an Indian king from the 9th century. In addition, many of the band's songs feature traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar, tamboura, and tabla, juxtaposed with guitar-heavy, Western rock instrumentation. Despite achieving commercial success, Kula Shaker were unpopular with many critics, with The Observer'''s Simon Price describing them in 2014 as a \"joke band\". Kula Shaker disbanded in September 1999 but reformed in 2004 for sessions for the School of Braja compilation album. This led to plans for a full comeback, although the reformation was not widely publicised until the beginning of 2006. The band's third album, Strangefolk, was issued in 2007 and their fourth, Pilgrims Progress, was released in 2010.

They were one of the founders of the Norwegian black metal scene and their music has strongly influenced the black metal genre. Mayhem's early career was highly controversial, primarily due to their notorious live performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (\"Dead\") and the 1993 murder of guitarist \u00d8ystein Aarseth (\"Euronymous\") by former member Varg Vikernes (\"Count Grishnackh\") of Burzum. The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the incidents of violence surrounding them. Mayhem disbanded after Aarseth's murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (\"Hellhammer\"), J\u00f8rn Stubberud (\"Necrobutcher\") and Sven Erik Kristiansen (\"Maniac\") reformed the next year with Rune Eriksen (\"Blasphemer\") replacing Aarseth.

The majority of its stores are corporate-owned, while franchises are mainly conceded in countries where corporate properties cannot be foreign-owned. Inditex business is centered around one simple premise: to be quick at responding to the market. Whereas it would take almost a year for a traditional fashion company to get its products out, from conception to runway to stores, for Inditex this process takes less than two months, in order to replenish stores with new and different products weekly and respond quickly. This is not without consequences on the earth and people, as it is the biggest fast fashion brand in the world. New styles are prototyped in just 5 days, and 60% of the manufacturing happens locally to shorten lead-times. In Zara stores, it can take a new garment as little as 15 days to go from design and production to store shelves."

These nine have long been considered together, notably since the survey of their origins in the 1907 The Cambridge History of English and American Literature. Seven of the nine colonial colleges became seven of the eight Ivy League universities: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Dartmouth. (The remaining Ivy League institution, Cornell University, was founded in 1865).  These are all private universities. The two colonial colleges not in the Ivy League are now both public universities \u2014 The College of William & Mary in Virginia and Rutgers University in New Jersey. William & Mary was a royal charter institution from 1693 until the American Revolution. Between the Revolution and the American Civil War, it was a private institution, but it suffered significant damage during the Civil War and began to receive public support in the 1880s. William & Mary officially became a public college in 1906. Rutgers was founded in 1766 as Queen's College, named for Queen Charlotte, and was for much of its history privately affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church. It changed its name to Rutgers University in 1825 and was designated as the State University of New Jersey after World War II."

Two of the four-cylinder engines were joined to make a 3616\u00a0cc V-8 which was fitted to a car that ran in the 1903 Paris-Madrid race.  That year Ader listed twin-cylinder cars of 904\u00a0cc and 1571\u00a0cc, as well as four-cylinder ones of 1810\u00a0cc and 3142\u00a0cc; each was available in a wide range of coachwork.

A new company was formed in 1905 to separate car building activities from the other activities and registered as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ader. The factory was located at 40 bis Avenue de Suffren, Paris. The V engines were dropped in favour of the vertical ones in 1907 but this was the final year cars were made though the V-4 engines were made for supplying to other car and boat makers for a few years. The Ader car was sold in the United Kingdom as the Pegasus. In 1903 the company also made a shaft-driven motorcycle sold as the Moto-Cardan."

Although they managed to attain national chart success only briefly with two singles, the Music Machine is today considered by many critics to be one of the groundbreaking acts of the 1960s. Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format. In 1965, the band came together as a folk rock trio known as the Raggamuffins, before expanding to the quintet that was later rechristened the Music Machine. The group was known for their style of dress, clothing themselves in all-black attire. In 1966, the Music Machine was signed to Original Sound, and released its first single \"Talk Talk\" in the latter half of the year, with it reaching the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Their debut album (Turn On) The Music Machine and the moderate hit \"The People in Me\" followed. The band's original lineup fragmented in late 1967 after managerial and financial disputes. Bonniwell reassembled the group under the name The Bonniwell Music Machine. In 1968, a second album, The Bonniwell Music Machine appeared, but the group disbanded in early 1969."

        "content": "Spitfire are a British band from Crawley, West Sussex, England whose ever-changing line up revolved around brothers Nick and Jeff Pitcher. Other members included Steve White, Justin Welch, Steven Walker (who went on to play in the Auteurs and Modern English), Matt Wise, and Scott Kenny. Two early EPs on Eve Recordings saw the band linked to the shoegazing scene, and to the Scene That Celebrates Itself, although a cover of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" theme staked out their retro appeal. Around this time, the band were involved in several controversial incidents; including the handing out of backstage passes for groupies, and a string of apparently sexist proclamations to the music press of the time. The band later insisted that these incidents were merely ironic, and intended to poke fun at rock stars' posturing. Their debut album, Feverish, was released on Paperhouse Records in 1993. 'Feverish' is a 6-track compilation of the first two EVE Recordings EP's 'Translucent' & 'Superbaby', which was licensed to and released by the French label Danceteria in 1992. Spitfire were hailed as influential by many New wave of new wave bands, and regularly gigged with S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men between 1994 and 1996. The Pitcher brothers were resident DJs at Brighton club The Basement, which with Camden's Good Mixer pub and Blow Up club was at the core of the pre-Britpop scene. In 1994 a 3 track e.p 'Big Banger' was released on the Lowlife label. The line up now included the Pitcher brothers, Steve Burgan on guitar and Lawrence Shaft on drums. UK tours followed and a live session featured on BBC Radio 1's Mark Radcliffe show. A second album Electric Colour Climax, followed on Lowlife Records in 1996. The band again courted controversy, with a sleeve featuring a retro pornographic image, found at London's Toe Rag Studies where the band had recorded the album on vintage recording equipment in five days. The band drifted apart around 1999, with the Pitcher brothers forming Cheetah. Wise and Kenny had, meanwhile, started a new band called Society who continue to write and perform material to the present day. Nick Pitcher has a family of groups, Rex Speedway and Thee Fortune Tellers, Rex Speedway and the Denim Avengers, Rex Speedway and the Majestic 12 and Rex Speedway and the MKUltra. These groups consist of some of the finest garage musicians in Brighton with a glowing CV."

Mokoma is similar but slightly more gracious word to \"damned\" or \"accursed\". Through the years several members have come and gone, but only Annala has remained constant. The band started out as a more traditional rock band with their first two albums \"Valu\" and \"Mokoman 120 p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4\". However, both albums sold badly and they were eventually dropped when they suggested to their record company (EMI), that they wanted to play something closer to their hearts, thrash metal. The group moved on and created their own record company, called Sakara Records, and released their third album \"Kurimus\", which is sometimes regarded as the first thrash metal album sung in Finnish. That was the first release of the members' independent record company Sakara Records.

Tiger quickly got British press attention after their debut single \"Shining in the Wood\" was played on BBC Radio 1. The musical climate of the time was dominated by Britpop and retro bands influenced by Oasis. Tiger, who were characterised by fuzzy guitars and multiple keyboards, were quickly held up as part of a new alternative. The band had two keyboardists using synthesizers and used droning song structures similar to Stereolab and Neu!, but with a stronger pop element. The band were often criticised for their (lack of) fashion sense: they wore outdated clothes and at least two members of the band had mullet haircuts, which, although they became fashionable, were out of place at the time. The band recorded and released their 1996 debut album We are Puppets less than a year after they first formed. The album's singles, \"Race\", \"My Puppet Pal\", and \"On The Rose\" were minor successes although only \"Race\" reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. NME invited them to perform on their Brat Bus Tour in 1997. In late 1998, they supported Pulp, but any impetus had been lost by this point and they were dropped from their record label shortly after. Their Stephen Street-produced second album Rosaria eventually appeared on the Tugboat label in 1999, but shortly afterwards they split up."

Their lyrics concern nationalistic, pagan (Hendrik M\u00f6bus is the founder of the Deutsche Heidnische Front), pro-heathen revivalist Germanic, and anti-Judeo-Christian themes. The band achieved infamy because its original members (not in the band since 1999) murdered the 15-year-old Sandro Beyer in 1993. The canonical motive is that Beyer was privy to an illicit relationship of Schauseil's with a married woman, and had been spreading rumours about this and other activities of the band.  On 29 April in Sondershausen, the then-17-year-old band members M\u00f6bus, Schauseil, and Kirchner enticed Beyer to a meeting, and strangled him there with an electrical cord. Kirchner, in a now infamous quotation, was reported as saying: \"Oh shit\u2014now I\u2019ve completely ruined my life.\"  Schauseil claimed to have heard a voice in his head saying the nonsensical phrase \"Kuster Maier\", which he interpreted as \"T\u00f6te Beyer\" (\"Kill Beyer\")."

It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the second single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), was preceded by the single \"Nine in the Afternoon\". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco. Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, \"New Perspective\", for the movie Jennifer's Body, and recruited bassist Dallon Weekes and guitarist Ian Crawford as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for Vices & Virtues ended in 2012. As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances. In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In April 2015, \"Hallelujah\" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band. In March 2018, Panic! at the Disco released \"Say Amen (Saturday Night)\", the lead single from its sixth studio album, Pray for the Wicked (2018), which was released in June."

The Jena Urburschenschaft had 859 active students as members, about 60 per cent of all the students  at the university of Jena from 1815 to 1820.

They have a theatrical stage sense derived from Alice Cooper and The Tubes (for a while in the mid-1990s, their stage paraphernalia included a working guillotine), and an approach to arrangements that Morgan has described as \"\u2026 the Frankenstein method of song arrangement\u2026 'Well, we like these verses, but the chorus on that song is way better. So we'll just graft it right on there, make a whole new beast.' We just start fooling around, and then we go 'Hey, this Alice Cooper song fits right on there, and to hell with the chorus. Let's put the chorus of \"Runaway\" by Del Shannon in there because it's better!'\" In late 2008, the Squirrels announced a year ahead of time that they would be breaking up the band and referred to their last year's gigs as the \"Death With Dignity Tour\"; their last show in that era was the December 12, 2009 20th Annual XXXmas show.

The group, whose original line-up consisted of Tommy Blom, G\u00f6ran Lagerberg, Danne Larsson, Anders T\u00f6pel and Freddie Skantze, were one of the most successful Swedish bands of the 1960s. They achieved thirteen top-20 singles on Kv\u00e4llstoppen, such as \"Sleep Little Girl\", \"I Should Be Glad\", \"In My Dreams\", and \"Miss Mac Baren\", as well as having two albums certified gold, Tages (1965) and Tages 2 (1966). Tages began their recording career as a beat band, heavily influenced and inspired by the Beatles. Initially, the group garnered much criticism from other musicians, who considered them inexperienced. This led to them quickly developing as a group, drawing influences from British mod artists, specifically Small Faces, and like them, were the center of Swedish male fashion from 1965 onward. The band would cover songs from virtually unknown artists in Sweden, such as John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters, but also from competitors, such as the Everly Brothers, the Easybeats and Small Faces. Between 1965 and 1967, Tages managed to record five studio albums, including Extra Extra (1966), which was among the first psychedelic rock albums recorded. During the later part of their career, Tages pioneered a genre of music, combining elements of Swedish folk music with contemporary rock music. In doing so, the group recorded their final studio album, simply titled Studio (1967), which solely contains original material and has often times been considered among the best Swedish albums of the 1960s. In mid-late 1968, Blom departed the band, after which they renamed themselves Blond. After a line-up change leaving Lagerberg the only original member left, they released one album, The Lilac Years, on the Fontana label in 1969."

Rosenstock and several other contributors were previously members of the Arrogant Sons of Bitches. As that band was breaking up, Rosenstock recorded the first BtMI! song, \"Sweet Home Cananada,\" using his PowerBook's built-in microphone. \"I wrote that song and put it out to see if anybody wanted it. That was how it started, people showed interest and I like recording stuff.\" The band was known for their DIY punk ethic, embodied in actions such as distributing six albums worth of their own material for free on their website, and offering free stencils and paint for fans to create their own T-shirts. They also made it a point to play all-ages shows with ticket prices of $10 or less, and offered fans a chance to perform on stage if they learned a song and brought an instrument to the show.  This sparked comparisons such as \"the Fugazi for the internet age of punk.\" Over time, the band's lineup shifted from \"pretty much a free-for-all\" to a fairly steady five-member lineup. In 2012, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, stating that their summer US tour would likely be their last because \"the 9 - 10 months of our lives when we are not playing music are not fantastic.\" Following an international farewell tour in 2013, the band played their final show in Brooklyn on January 19, 2014. BTMI recordings have been featured on television shows such as Weeds and The Office."

After the company expanded operations to pork and other areas, Iowa Beef Processors, Inc., became IBP, Inc. Occidental Petroleum owned IBP from 1981 to 1987, and was the majority owner from 1987 to 1991. The original IBP features prominently in Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation as the company that closed down the Chicago meatpacking district as a result of its industrial practices. Founded as Iowa Beef Packers, Inc. on March 17, 1960 by Currier J. Holman and A.D. Anderson, it opened its first slaughterhouse in Denison, Iowa, and eliminated the need for skilled workers. In 1967, IBP introduced boxed beef and pork, which were vacuum packed and in smaller portions. It was a new option then, when the traditional method of shipping product was in whole carcass form. The boxed meat also saved energy and transportation costs by eliminating the shipment of fat, bones and trimmings. When workers in the IBP plant in Dakota City went on strike in 1969, Holman and three top executives held secret meetings with Moe Steinman, a 'labour consultant' with close ties to La Cosa Nostra, in New York, who helped to end the New York butchers' boycott (in support of the meatpackers' strike). After a lengthy investigation of mob involvement in the New York City meat business, Currier J. Holman and IBP were tried and convicted in 1974 for bribing union leaders and meat wholesalers. IBP was acquired by Tyson Foods in 2001 for US$3.2 billion in cash and stock. Tyson continues to use the IBP name as a brand for its commodity beef and pork products."

Internode Pty Ltd was founded in May 1991. In 1997 Hackett founded a subsidiary called Agile Communications that was a licensed national telecommunications carrier and was the first South Australian based company to gain this license.

Hackett departed the executive team at Internode to join the board of iiNet in August 2012.  On 12 November 2013 it was announced that he had been appointed to the board of the National Broadband Network, and that he had resigned his position with iiNet. He departed the board of the National Broadband Network in April 2016 and was replaced by Michael Malone.

It was the largest and most respected bank in Europe during its prime. There are some estimates that the Medici family was, for a period of time, the wealthiest family in Europe. Estimating their wealth in today's money is difficult and imprecise, considering that they owned art, land, and gold. With this monetary wealth, the family acquired political power initially in Florence, and later in the wider spheres of Italy and Europe. A notable contribution to the professions of banking and accounting pioneered by the Medici Bank was the improvement of the general ledger system through the development of the double entry system of tracking debits and credits or deposits and withdrawals. Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici was the first Medici to enter banking on his own, and while he became influential in the Florentine government, it was not until his son Cosimo the Elder took over in 1434 as gran maestro that the Medici became the unofficial head of state of the Florentine republic."

Notable products were Movie cameras, 126 and 110 cameras with built-in electronic flash (the \"Everflash\" series). In the 1930s, the firm built low cost 16mm cameras that are still in use today. The firm considered that labeling its products as Made in USA was an important part of its appeal. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in January 1991. One popular version of their movie camera line was the Capri K27, with 3 lenses and 9 settings for cloudy to sunny day conditions. This was a light, easy to use movie camera, and is considered a rare collectable today. The firm was originally located in Boston, MA and moved to Clifton, NJ when purchased by Berkey Photo in 1968. In 1970 they began to manufacture the Everflash series of cameras in Clifton that accepted Kodak's new 126 cartridge film, and several years later Everflash cameras that handled the then new Kodak 110 cartridge film. Keystone's claim to fame was their built in electronic flash rather than having to use a flash bulb or flash cube, which was popular then on many other cameras. Poor internal management structure led to many quality problems in the early 1970s and serious losses. Keystone later added its instant picture Everflash camera using Polaroid film again stressing the Everflash feature rather than Polaroid's use of the Flash Bar. From 1970 to 1977, Berkey accounted for 8.2% Of the sales in the camera market in the United States, reaching a peak of 10.2% In 1976. In 1978, Berkey sold its camera division and thus abandoned this market."

Formed in 1996 when the members were studying fine art at Cardiff University, the band has released material under various record labels, including Soda, FF Vinyl, and V2. The band's sound was described by NME as being \"as eclectic as their name is confusing\". Likened to Beck, Sonic Youth and Pavement, Mo-Ho-Bish-O-Pi have been reported as being \"closer to The Flaming Lips with overtones of Bis and ABBA\". Their \"punky garage\" sound is evident on singles such as \"Drop Jaw\" and \"Playboy\", while a melancholic and perhaps more accessible side is demonstrated on \"Names for Nameless Things\". The band's name is derived from Moho bishopi, the scientific name of the Moloka\u2018i \u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d, an extinct bird known to have lived in Hawaii. Martin Bimrose saw an article about the bird in the Reader's Digest whilst waiting at the dentist's. He thought that with some imaginative punctuation, \"the name could be as mad as he is\". Following the bands demise (the group has been inactive since 2002), Mike Carter and Richard Arnold went on to form The International Karate Plus but they have since also ceased to exist. Richard Arnold now plays in King Alexander, and Mike Carter was in Heck with former members of the Cardiff band, Sammo Hung, before they split in 2017."

It arose through a process of syncretism between the traditional religions of West Africa, the Roman Catholic form of Christianity, and Haitian Vodou. The religion existed from the 18th century to the early 20th century, by which point it had effectively died out, only to be revived in an altered form in the late 20th century. No central authority is in control of Louisiana Voodoo, which is organized through autonomous groups. Historical records reveal the names of various deities who were worshiped in Voodoo, prominent among them were Blanc Dani, the Grand Zombi, and Papa L\u00e9bat. These were venerated at altars, where there sacrifices were made to them. Spirits of the dead also played a prominent role in historical Voodoo, with some contemporary practitioners regarding the religion as a form of ancestor worship. Historical accounts suggest that in the 19th century, the saints played a prominent role, although amid the 20th-century revival, the veneration of deities from other African diasporic religions became common. The production of charms, which are known as gris-gris, plays an important part. From the early 18th century, enslaved West Africans\u2014the majority of them Bambara and Kongo\u2014were brought to the French colony of Louisiana. There, their traditional religions would have syncretized with the Roman Catholic beliefs of the French. This continued as Louisiana came under Spanish control and was then purchased by the United States in 1803. In the early 19th century, many migrants fleeing the Haitian Revolution arrived in Louisiana, bringing with them Haitian Vodou, which contributed to the formation of Louisiana Voodoo. Although the religion was never banned, its practice was restricted through a range of laws regulating when and where black people could gather. Practiced secretly, it spread up the Mississippi River to Missouri. During the 19th century, several prominent practitioners, such as Marie Laveau and Doctor John, attracted considerable attention. By the early 20th century, the public practice of Voodoo had heavily declined, although many of its practices survived as hoodoo. After the 1960s, the New Orleans tourist industry increasingly used references to Voodoo to attract visitors, while a Voodoo revival took place, the practitioners of which often drew heavily on other African diasporic religions such as Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santer\u00eda. Although originating among African diasporic communities in New Orleans, Louisiana Voodoo has included white participants since at least the 19th century, and some contemporary Voodoo groups have a majority-white membership. The religion has long faced opposition from non-practitioners, who have characterized it as witchcraft and devil-worship, and many sensationalist portrayals of the religion have featured in popular culture."

        "content": "The White Sewing Machine Company was a sewing machine company founded in 1858  in Templeton, Massachusetts, by Thomas H. White and  based in Cleveland, Ohio, since 1866. Founded as the White Manufacturing Company it took the White Sewing Machine Company name when it was incorporated in 1876. In 1900, Thomas White's son, Rollin, developed a steam engine, using a corner of one of his father's factories to start building automobiles. In 1906 the automotive venture was spun off as its own company, the White Motor Company. By 1923, the White Sewing Machine Company had divested all side ventures to focus solely on sewing machines and accessories. By the early 1950s, however, White was losing money amid a flood of cheaper imported sewing machines and the loss of a supplier contract from Sears, which had represented 40 percent of White's business. Edward Reddig became company president in 1955, and he led an aggressive campaign of shifting manufacturing overseas, slashing domestic manufacturing and diversification. White moved heavily into appliances, tools and machinery, acquiring appliance brands such as Kelvinator (from American Motors), Gibson, Philco (from Ford Motor Company/GTE) and Franklin (private label supplier, from Studebaker-Worthington). To reflect this, the company renamed itself name White Consolidated Industries (WCI) in 1964. WCI purchased Westinghouse's major appliance business in 1975, which resulted in creation of the White-Westinghouse brand name. In 1979, WCI bought the Frigidaire appliance line from General Motors. WCI was acquired by Electrolux in 1986. In 2006 Electrolux spun off a number of its lines under the Husqvarna (including variations of the Husqvarna) brand name. The White line of sewing machines was consolidated into the lower end Husqvarna Viking brand after this spinoff. The White-Westinghouse brand name remained with Electrolux and that name is the only remnant of the \"White Sewing Machine Company\" name, however the brand line included no sewing machines. New White-branded sewing machines models have not been manufactured since the Husqvarna spinoff in 2006. Singer, Husqvarna Viking and Pfaff brands are now all owned by SVP Worldwide. Though not advertised, SVP provides all of their user manuals for all of their brands including the \"White\" brand through the Singer brand website."

Their intent is to recognize the rights to independence from Italian Republic of the populations living in the territory of the former Republic of Genoa. Such Republic became the Ligurian Republic in 1797, it was incorporated in French Empire by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805, and finally it was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia after Congress of Vienna in 1815. The movement considers that the annexation of the Republic (reconstituted for a brief period in the 1815) to the Kingdom of Sardinia is illegal. In fact, such cancellation would be made without any ratification by the lawful outgoing government, and the following annexation would occur in the absence of any pronouncement of the population, unlike the subsequent annexations of territories that led to the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, sanctioned by popular vote."

Their music is a fusion of rock, cumbia, and Mexican traditional music like mariachi and son, creating the genre called guacarrock (rock and guacamole). The band was always distinguished by a festive and irreverent musical fusion, celebrating the culture of the nacos and integrating sketches and albures in its lyrics and concerts. Its style, standard rock, was combined with satirical lyrics that portrayed urban life and popular culture in Mexico City. In their song \"Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", they coined the phrase Todo lo naco es chido (Everything tacky is cool), trying to re-vindicate the popular culture of the lower socio-economic classes. Botellita de Jerez pioneered a lot of trends from contemporary art in Mexico and the United States, since it incorporated motifs from popular use, such as lucha libre, popular dances and slang, which are now commonly used among the upper classes as well. The name of the band comes from a Mexican saying used as rebuttal in an argument: \"Botellita de jerez, todo lo que me digas, ser\u00e1 al rev\u00e9s\", which literally means: \"Bottle of sherry, all you say to me will be otherwise\" However, the equivalent English idiom is: \"I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.\" One of their most notable songs is \"Ni\u00f1a de mis ojos\" included in the LP of the same name, which has been released on the albums \"El Ultimo Guacarrock\" and \"Superespecial Un Plug\". The signature songs of Botellita de Jerez are \"Guacarrock\", \"El Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", \"Alarmala de Tos\", \"Oh Denny's\" and \"Abuelita de Batman\" (The Granny of Batman) which became the first cumbia-rock of the rock band, the song is notable for its parody-music video filmed in Colonia Santa Mar\u00eda la Ribera in Mexico City."

It has 8,050 branches and 13,000 ATMs. It is one of the most valuable bank brands. Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between the original Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998. While Norwest was the nominal survivor, the merged company took the better-known Wells Fargo name and moved to Wells Fargo's hub in San Francisco, while its banking subsidiary merged with Wells Fargo's Sioux Falls-based banking subsidiary. With the 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia, Wells Fargo became a coast-to-coast bank. Wells Fargo is ranked 37th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the US. The company has been the subject of several investigations by regulators; on February 2, 2018, account fraud by the bank resulted in the Federal Reserve barring Wells Fargo from growing its nearly $2 trillion-asset base any further until the company fixed its internal problems to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve. In September 2021, Wells Fargo incurred further fines from the United States Justice Department charging fraudulent behavior by the bank against foreign-exchange currency trading customers."

Though physical trading, logistics and distribution are at the core of the business, these are complemented by refining, shipping, terminals, exploration and production, power generation, and retail businesses. Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore. With revenues of $231 billion in 2018, it is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would rank ninth on the Fortune Global 500 list. Because Vitol does not publish its profits widely, much like most of its competitors in commodity trading, it is largely excluded from rankings. The company does provide financial information to its lenders and some energy groups with which it trades. The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7 million barrels a day of oil and products - roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan - the world's fourth largest oil consumer after the United States, China, and India. Vitol is a private company which is owned significantly by a proportion of its employees, who are known for their culture of privacy and secrecy, from both competitors and the general public. In March 2015, the Financial Times suggested that Vitol appeared to make a $1.2 billion dividend distribution."

The name \"The Orion Experience\" is a \"self-effacing\" reference to other bands like The Alan Parsons Project and The Steve Perry Project. The band\u2019s gender-fluid themes and presentation have attracted a strong LGBTQ+ fanbase. In 2006, The Orion Experience released their first studio album, Cosmicandy, on Sweet! Records. In 2007, the band performed at Fearless Music, and in early 2008, Perez Hilton called the song \"Obsessed With You\" \"an indie pop gem . . . double yum.\" The same song was also featured in the 2019 thriller The Honeymoon Phase. Their 2008 EP release, Heartbreaker, was produced by Maroon 5 producer Jon Kaplan. In 2009, the band released Cosmicandy in Japan and included all 4 songs from Heartbreaker, as well as a new track called \"Nippon Ga Dai Suki (Japan We Love You!).\" Their second EP, NYC Girl, was released on April 19, 2011. USA Today described the title track as a \"string-infused disco-pop ditty\" reminiscent of \"70s-era Electric Light Orchestra.\" In October 2012, the band put on an immersive theater show at Dixon Place in Manhattan's Lower East Side with the \"idea to make a rock concert that brought fantasy back to live music.\" The following year, the band created an off-Broadway show called The Orion Experience, which opened in August, 2013 at XL Nightclub. The show was directed by Travis Greisler, produced by Ryan Bogner, and choreographed by Misha Shields. The cast featured Simprini, Horwatt, Reef Rox, and Honey Davenport as the Queen of White Lies. The show was accompanied by their second full-length album, Children of the Stars, which includes expanded versions of the songs from the live theater productions. In 2014, the band recorded the single \"Rich Man's Holiday.\" In the following years, both lead singers Simprini and Horwatt wrote and produced solo albums. Horwatt recorded the album Stupid Love and the self-titled EP Linda XO. Simprini produced his EP Lush Life and other singles. Due to a rise in online popularity in 2019 and 2020, the band reestablished itself and began releasing more music.

Along with Trypes, they are considered to be the most popular band in Greece, which became very popular in the 90's. Their music combines elements from pop, rock and electronic music, maintaining a Greek melodic \"colour\" at the same time. The personal and experimental lyrics of Pavlos Pavlidis are distinguished for their poetry and the pictures that they give.

From 1993 until their break-up, in 2003, the band released 5 albums (4 studio, 1 live) and 1 CD single. Although they had a big commercial success from early on, the group avoided media exposure and maintained their artistic autonomy, seeking to develop their sound from album to album and during their live performances, where they used to experiment and improvise with their songs. The original line-up of the group consisted of: Pavlos Pavlidis (vocals, guitar), Vasilis Gountaroulis (keyboards, samplers), Christos Tsaprazis (bass) and Panos Tolios (drums, percussion 1993\u20131997). Members of the band had also been: Stavros Rossopoulos (guitar 1993\u20131994), Takis Kanellos (drums 1997), Giannis Mitsis (drums 1998\u20132003), Kostas Pantelis (guitar 2000\u20132003) and Nikos Kyriakopoulos (percussion, backing vocals 2001\u20132003).

The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the \"Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'\". The company won its first big contract in 1938 to provide test and measurement instruments for Walt Disney's production of the animated film Fantasia, which allowed Hewlett and Packard to formally establish the Hewlett-Packard Company on July 2, 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo moved ahead of HP. HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware; designing software; and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software, and a range of printers and other imaging products. The company directly marketed its products to households; small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, as well as via online distribution; consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers; software partners; and major technology vendors. It also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products. In 1999, HP spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business into Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired Electronic Data Systems in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4\u00a0billion that year and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009.

Kyo () is also from Chinese pronunciation, pronounced as Hibiki (noun) or Hibiku (verb) in traditional Japanese, meaning \"resound, sound, or echo\". The company started under the name of Osaka Denki Onkyo K.K. in 1946 (a company not related to Nippon Denki Onkyo, which became Denon). The current Onkyo Corporation umbrella includes the Integra and Integra Research divisions as well as the main Onkyo brand. In March 2015, Onkyo purchased Pioneer Corporation's Home Electronics Corporation, which produces home cinema amplifiers, Blu-ray players and other AV products. In return, Pioneer took a 14.95% stake in Onkyo. The Ohtsuki family remained the largest shareholders of the company with an approximately 26% stake, just above Gibson Brands, with a 16.5% stake. With the bankruptcy of Gibson in 2018, Onkyo's shares held by Gibson were sold, as the company itself reported. In the summer of 2020, major US retailers Amazon and Best Buy discontinued sales of Onkyo products. A call to Onkyo USA's  customer service line indicated the number is no longer in service.  Distribution of Onkyo, Pioneer, Integra and Elite products has changed hands from Onkyo USA to 11 Trading Company.  However, as in June 2021, Amazon has on sale Onkyo audio systems and related products, although mostly pre-2021 models In January 2021, Onkyo announced it could no longer take direct orders from UK customers, citing new post-Brexit regulations and fees as the reason. As of June 2021, there has been no further update from Onkyo. Onkyo acquired Pioneer's consumer electronics division in 2015; following the acquisition, both Onkyo and Pioneer A/V branded products continued to be available in the UK. However, Pioneer's consumer electronics website for the UK is no longer available. It was previously available as https://eu.pioneer-av.com//uk. The Pioneer Europe GmbH website continues to be available for EU customers. Onkyo's / Pioneer's former UK address in Ruislip is listed as permanently closed. In May 2021, Voxx International/Sharp Corporation began negotiations with Onkyo to purchase the struggling company. On June 3, 2021, Voxx announced that they had reached an agreement. On June 25, 2021, Onkyo shareholders approved the Voxx acquisition. Although the initial May 2021 announcement reported that Pioneer and Pioneer Elite would not be part of the deal, Voxx announced in its final Onkyo deal on June 29, 2021, that they had entered a licensing agreement for Pioneer brands \"for all markets, except China.\""

Originally based in Chicago, Illinois, the company concentrated on Macintosh games during its early years and created two successful video game franchises called Marathon and Myth. An offshoot studio, Bungie West, produced Oni, published in 2001 and owned by Take-Two Interactive, which held a 19.9% ownership stake at the time. Microsoft acquired Bungie in 2000, and its project Halo: Combat Evolved was repurposed as a launch title for Microsoft's Xbox console. Halo became the Xbox's \"killer app\", selling millions of copies and spawning the Halo franchise. On October 5, 2007, Bungie announced that it had split from Microsoft and become a privately held independent company, Bungie LLC, while Microsoft retained ownership of the Halo franchise intellectual property. It signed a ten-year publishing deal with Activision in April 2010. Their first project was the 2014 first-person shooter, Destiny, which was followed by Destiny 2 in 2017. In January 2019, Bungie announced it was ending this partnership, and would take over publishing for Destiny. In January 2022, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced their intent to acquire Bungie as part of their family of studios, though Bungie would remain an independent and multi-platform studio and publisher. Among Bungie's side projects is Bungie.net, the company's website, which includes company information, forums, and statistics-tracking and integration with many of its games. Bungie.net serves as the platform from which Bungie sells company-related merchandise out of the Bungie Store and runs other projects, including Bungie Aerospace, charitable organization the Bungie Foundation, a podcast, and online publications about game topics.

Papa vs Pretty's musical style evolved from the initial fusion of indie rock and electronica of their first two EPs, to a more guitar-driven alternative rock sound from 2010s Heavy Harm EP onwards. Papa vs Pretty has gained notable attention in the Australian music scene for their \"intimidatingly tight\" and energetic live performances. Their 2010 tracks \"Heavy Harm\" and \"Wrecking Ball\" and 2011 singles \"One of the Animals\", \"Honey\" and \"Darkest Way\" received heavy rotation on Australian radio station Triple J. Papa vs Pretty's debut album United in Isolation was released on 27 May 2011 to positive reviews, including a 9 out of 10 rating from Triple J Magazine and a coveted Triple J Feature Album slot. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2011 ARIA Music Awards, and for Album of the Year at the 2011 J Awards.

The \"Feiyue\" () name translates \"to leap\" or \"to fly over.\" The name during creation was resonant of the Great Leap Forward. The shoes were first produced in Shanghai during the 1920s. Since 2006 there have been two separate companies creating Feiyue shoes: Da Fu Rubber and its subsidiary manufacturer, Double Coin Holdings, and a French company operating separately from the original Chinese company. Feiyue China shoes were worn by a number of performers during the opening of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, showing that they are still in common use in China. The original version is popular worldwide among practitioners of parkour for their light weight, thin sole, and flexibility. Feiyue shoes returned to the spotlight after actor Orlando Bloom was spotted wearing the American version of the shoes, causing a resurgence in interest for the brand. The Chinese factory has 3,000 employees producing 36,000 pairs a day, with an average 5,000,000 pairs a year sold in China. In 2019 Feiyue was re-launched in the UK and Europe after a decade hiatus by entrepreneur Matthew Derwent Wapples, who subsequently launched Tenements Clothing also a Feiyue stockist."

The first release was aptly titled 'holed up'  and was written and recorded in San Francisco, California. Driven by simple acoustic guitar lines, graceful string orchestrations, and Levitt's hushed vocals, Setting Sun's songwriting, arrangements and lyrics were called \"dramatic and poignant\" by NPR. The sound is centered on the song, with poppy hooks and choruses, while mixing synth experimentalism in with its folky, string-band sound. It is tough to characterize the sound of the band as it is crossover between indie-rock, folk and chamber pop music. Born in Queens New York, Levitt has been playing music since he picked up a guitar in high school and immediately began writing songs. Studying film and music in college, Levitt\u2019s music has taken him around the world, living in San Francisco, Los Angeles, London and New York where he's worked with a wide array of artists and producers, ranging from the highly lauded to musicians far below the radar. Levitt\u2019s songs have appeared in a number of television shows, commercials and films. Levitt often plays most of the instruments on Setting Sun records, but invites help from friends and other talented musicians for such instruments as violin, cello, trumpet and occasionally drums. Setting Sun continue to tour extensively. They've toured the US and Europe multiple times building up a grass roots fan base the old fashioned way. Setting Sun released their 5th record in the summer of 2014 titled 'Be Here When You Get There'. Here's what the editors of iTunes had to say: \"For Be Here When You Get There, Setting Sun\u2019s Gary Levitt tightened the songs; all 10 clock in between two and three-plus minutes, as if he\u2019d just listened to the classic pop records of the \u201860s and new wave \u201870s and decided that quickness was key\"."

After replacing Wilkinson with former Novak drummer Phil Robinson, the band recorded a John Peel session before being forced to change their name following legal threats from an Irish band of the same name.

The original group membership included Robb Royer, Tim Hallinan, Michele Cochrane and Stephen Cohn. Robb Royer obtained his first guitar when he was 19 years old and a college sophomore at San Fernando Valley State College in Northridge (now California State University at Northridge).  He met Tim Hallinan at the school.  \"Finally, when I began playing guitar, the scales tipped and Tim saw reason to talk to me. He liked to sing and I liked to play.\" The two began to perform together as \"Robb & Tim\" and then later added the talent of Michele Cochrane.  Hallinan recalled \"What I remember best about Michele was, first, that she could actually sing. I was just faking it, doing what I\u2019ve done since I was born, an approach to life that begins with the words, 'Act like you can \u2013'  In this case, it was sing. But Michele actually could; she had a glorious voice.\" Soon the trio became a quartet with the addition of Stephen Cohn, who had previously graduated from Valley State's music department, whom they had seen when he gave a senior recital in classical guitar.  The group called themselves by various names, the most notable being \"The Pleasure Fair\" and by 1966 they managed to obtain a recording contract for a single with Hanna Barbera Records under the name \"The Rainy Day People\".  \"Junior Executive\" was the \"A\" side, backed with \"I'm Telling It To You\" (both songs written by Cohn, Hallinan and Royer) The group signed a recording contract with Uni Records in 1967 David Gates was hired as the arranger and conductor for the Pleasure Fair's self-titled album. The album comprised twelve songs, eight of which were original compositions by Royer, Hallinan and Cohn with one additional song written by Cohn. They can briefly be seen performing in Ep7, S1 \"Tagged for Murder\" of the TV series Ironside. Royer's song \"Say What You See\" (co-written with Tim Hallinan) was produced in 1968 by Jimmy Griffin and arranged by David Gates.  It was sung by a trio calling themselves The Curtain Calls. Soon afterward in the same year the three founding members of Bread (Royer, Griffin and Gates) combined forces as their own group. Their song \"Morning Glory Days\" charted at number 34 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 in July 1967, making it their only song to chart on the main Billboard single charts."

The band is known for starting the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck, all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 greatest guitarists. The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \"For Your Love\", \"Heart Full of Soul\", \"Shapes of Things\", and \"Over Under Sideways Down\". Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \"rave-up\" instrumental breaks, the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneering psychedelic rock and early hard rock; and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s.  Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends. Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance and guitarist Jimmy Page formed Led Zeppelin - the latter of which was initially intended as a direct successor to the Yardbirds. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. They were included at number 89 in Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and ranked number 37 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.

After starting as an acoustic trio, the band later went electric and became known for its array of vocal and musical styles, before the band rebuilt its original sound in 2013 with new personnel in Tokyo: \"Pon\" (guitar); Shokei Konno on percussion,  Mari Uga on sax, and Rob Moreau (mandolin). They developed a national following after touring in Japan, including Hard Rock Cafe,  The Crocodile Club, and headlined events at the international music festival, Japan Music Week.  The group have also played in England,  Australia,  Canada and America, and much of SE Asia. The group featured frequently in the Japanese media, including TV, radio and press, receiving strong reviews in Metropolis, Japanzine, and Time Out, whose editor, Jon Wilks, described the songs as demonstrating \"lyrical genius\". Their first release, Shipwrecked, in November 2008, was closely followed in May 2009 by I Should've Stopped There, with their troubled album, Antidote, finally released in October 2011. After an accident involving the lead singer, The Gravy Train cancelled most live shows and recordings in 2012 but made a comeback in early 2013 in Tokyo, aiming to restart recording for the two albums, The Veil Has Been Lifted, and Prisoner in Paradise. The band headlined events at Hard Rock Cafe's anniversary celebrations in Tokyo and an all-day music festival in July, Tokyo Woodstock, before a summer tour of the US in 2013.  A round-the-world  tour of Japan, England, Canada and the US in the summer of 2015 was cut short after a car-crash in California, and the outfit is looking to record a new album in autumn 2016."

They formed Havnatt in the spring of 2006 when they were commissioned by the Skagestad family to turn three poems by the late Norwegian author Tormod Skagestad into music. The three poems were Myrulla, Havnatt and Prammen from the collection of poems entitled Havd\u00f8gn. In the autumn of 2009, Cecilie and Tom were asked by Prophecy Productions to write an exclusive piece of music for a compilation album entitled Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings. The new Havnatt track included in that release was named Dagen og natta. This led to Cecilie and Tom writing more Havnatt material. Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings was released on October 29, 2010. On February 15, 2012 Havnatt released their Havd\u00f8gn EP on the Secret Quarters label. This release contains completely remixed and remastered versions of the tracks Myrulla, Havnatt and Prammen. In addition, the release also contains two completely new tracks that gave a hint of the future direction of Havnatt. The EP received favorable reviews, described as \"very peaceful, relaxed, chilling and matches the twilight Norwegian landscapes\", \"calm, relaxing and easily accessible music\", Cecilie's voice described as \"just beautiful, angelic and with of eerie feel\" and Tom's guitar work as \"strongly based on melodious arpeggios and leads\". Shortly after the release of Havd\u00f8gn, the duo began to work on a full length album entitled Etterlatte, after Tormod Skagestad's poem with the same name. The first single from this album, Var je solblesten, was released by Secret Quarters as a digital distribution only release on September 25, 2012. The album has received favorable reviews.

They released their debut album, titled Like Nobody's Business, exclusively on vinyl through their own record label Spineless Voodoo Records the same year.

In 1990, the band released a promotional EP titled Dig, followed by their second full-length studio album, Thrumdrone, released a year later on Situation Two Records, along with an EP titled Blue Food & Black Sparks. A stopgap EP titled Holy Smokes was released in 1992, and contained a cover of \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" by Bad Company. The band was moved to Beggars Banquet Records after Situation Two dissolved the same year, and they then released their third and final studio album Welcome to Vas Llegas that year as well. The band also recorded a cover of \"Cold Ethyl\" for an Alice Cooper tribute album titled Welcome to Our Nightmare: A Tribute to Alice Cooper, released in 1993 on Triple X Records. Their lack of commercial success ultimately led to them being dropped from Beggars Banquet Records, and after an unsuccessful attempt at landing another record deal under the name Jerkwater, the band broke up altogether. Following the break-up, Bell formed a duo with his then-girlfriend, Susan Fox, called the Space Twins, and then became the rhythm guitarist for Weezer. Petak recorded a solo album titled Pretty Little Lonely, and Fallis became the drummer for Big Drill Car. The song \"Mr. Blue Veins\", from the album Thrumdrone, was featured in the episode \"Water Safety\" from the MTV animated series Beavis and Butt-head."

He is a member of the Korean pop group and later duo JYJ, and was one of the original members of boy band TVXQ. Kim made his debut in 2003 as a member of TVXQ, a boy band produced and formed by South Korean record label and talent agency SM Entertainment, having previously been a trainee for six years. He had released four Korean albums, four Japanese albums, thirty Japanese singles and several Korean singles during his first six years in the music industry as TVXQ. In 2009, Kim and fellow TVXQ members Kim Jaejoong and Park Yoochun filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment, arguing that their exclusive contracts were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of the three and granted an injunction suspending their contracts. The trio reunited and subsequently formed JYJ (formerly known as JUNSU/JAEJOONG/YOOCHUN in Japan). As JYJ, Kim has released one English album, two Korean albums, one Japanese EP, and one Korean EP. Kim began his solo career in 2010 with the release of Japanese EP Xiah, which peaked at number-two on Japan's Oricon singles chart. The same year, he took the role of Wolfgang in his debut musical Mozart!, receiving critical acclaim and commercial success. After the release of Xiah, Kim's solo music career was sent into hiatus because of a discord between him and his Japanese label Avex Trax that led to the sudden suspension of all his activities in Japan. In May 2012, he released his first full-length Korean solo studio album Tarantallegra, while being represented by new management agency C-JeS Entertainment. Following the release, he embarked on his first headlining world tour. He returned with his second Korean solo studio album, Incredible, in July 2013. Despite limitations in media coverage and promotional activities caused by a ban in the Entertainment Departments of South Korea's three main terrestrial broadcasters resulting from SM Entertainment's interference, Kim's first and second studio album reached top two on the Gaon albums chart in South Korea, as well as reaching number-ten and number-five on the Billboard World Albums chart for Tarantallegra and Incredible, respectively. He is also known for being able to sell out tickets for his concerts and musicals within minutes, dubbed \"the ticket power\" by South Korean media."
