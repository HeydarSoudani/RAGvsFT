        "content": "William Frederick Schelter (1947 \u2013 July 30, 2001) was a professor of mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin and a Lisp developer and programmer.  Schelter is credited with the development of the GNU Common Lisp (GCL) implementation of Common Lisp and the GPL'd version of the computer algebra system Macsyma called Maxima. Schelter authored Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) under contract with IBM. AKCL formed the foundation for Axiom, another computer algebra system. AKCL eventually became GNU Common Lisp. He is also credited with the first port of the GNU C compiler to the Intel 386 architecture, used in the original implementation of the Linux kernel. Schelter obtained his Ph.D. at McGill University in 1972. His mathematical specialties were noncommutative ring theory and computational algebra and its applications, including automated theorem proving in geometry. In the summer of 2001, age 54, he died suddenly of a heart attack while traveling in Russia."

        "title": "John Quincy Adams_Summary",
        "content": "John Quincy Adams (; July 11, 1767 \u2013 February 23, 1848) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, and diarist, who served as the 6th president of the United States from 1825 to 1829. He previously served as the 8th United States Secretary of State from 1817 to 1825. During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, and as a member of the United States Senate and House of Representatives representing Massachusetts. He was the eldest son of John Adams, who served as the second U.S. president from 1797 to 1801, and First Lady Abigail Adams. Initially a Federalist like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and in the mid-1830s became affiliated with the Whig Party. Born in Braintree, Massachusetts (now part of the town of Quincy), Adams spent much of his youth in Europe, where his father served as a diplomat. After returning to the United States, Adams established a successful legal practice in Boston. In 1794, President George Washington appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, and Adams would serve in high-ranking diplomatic posts until 1801, when Thomas Jefferson took office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809, President James Madison, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to Russia. Adams held diplomatic posts for the duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War of 1812. In 1817, President James Monroe selected Adams as his Secretary of State. In that role, Adams negotiated the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, which provided for the American acquisition of Florida. He also helped formulate the Monroe Doctrine, which became a key tenet of U.S. foreign policy. In 1818, Adams was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. Adams, Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay \u2014 all members of the Democratic-Republican Party \u2014 competed in the 1824 presidential election. Because no candidate won a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a contingent election, which Adams won with the support of Speaker of the House Clay, whom Adams would go on to controversially appoint as his Secretary of State. As president, Adams called for an ambitious agenda that included federally funded infrastructure projects, the establishment of a national university, and engagement with the countries of Latin America, but Congress refused to pass many of his initiatives. During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-Republican Party split into two major camps: the National Republican Party, which supported President Adams, and Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party. The Democrats proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson soundly defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, making Adams the second president after his father to fail to win re-election. Rather than retiring from public service, Adams won election to the House of Representatives, where he would serve from 1831 until his death in 1848. He remains the only ex-president to be elected to the chamber. After narrowly losing his bids for Governor of Massachusetts and Senate re-election, Adams joined the Anti-Masonic Party in the early 1830s before joining the Whig Party, which united those opposed to President Jackson. During his time in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of slavery and of the Southern leaders who he believed controlled the Democratic Party. He was particularly opposed to the annexation of Texas and the Mexican\u2013American War, which he saw as a war to extend slavery and its political grip on Congress. He also led the repeal of the \"gag rule\", which had prevented the House of Representatives from debating petitions to abolish slavery. Historians concur that Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of state in American history; they typically rank him as an average president, as he had an ambitious agenda but could not get it passed by Congress."

His 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria rusticana caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the Verismo movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Ruggiero Leoncavallo, was a \"one-opera man\" who could never repeat his first success, L'amico Fritz and Iris have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres. Mascagni wrote fifteen operas, an operetta, several orchestral and vocal works, and also songs and piano music. He enjoyed immense success during his lifetime, both as a composer and conductor of his own and other people's music and created a variety of styles in his operas."

He published on a diverse range of subjects, and from multiple views as his perspective changed over the years. Among his students was Alexander Luria and Kharkiv school of psychology. He is known for his concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD): the distance between what a student (apprentice, new employee, etc.) can do on their own, and what they can accomplish with the support of someone more knowledgeable about the activity. Vygotsky saw the ZPD as a measure of skills that are in the process of maturing, as supplement to measures of development that only look at a learner's independent ability. Also influential are his works on the relationship between language and thought, the development of language, and a general theory of development through actions and relationships in a socio-cultural environment. Vygotsky is the subject of great scholarly dispute. There is a group of scholars who see parts of Vygotsky's current legacy as distortions and who are going back to Vygotsky's manuscripts in an attempt to make Vygotsky's legacy more true to his actual ideas."

        "title": "Matthew Hale (jurist)_Summary",
        "content": "Sir Matthew Hale  (1 November 1609 \u2013 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and jurist most noted for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. However, more recently, his execution of at least two women for witchcraft, his defense of marital rape, and his belief that capital punishment should extend to those as young as fourteen might bring this into question. His Historia Placitorum Coron\u00e6, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \"of the highest authority\", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \"appeal to reason\" and John Selden's \"appeal to contract\", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009."

        "content": "Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour,  (,  ; 25 July 184819 March 1930), also known as Lord Balfour, was a British Conservative statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1902 to 1905. As foreign secretary in the Lloyd George ministry, he issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917 on behalf of the cabinet. Entering Parliament in 1874, Balfour achieved prominence as Chief Secretary for Ireland, in which position he suppressed agrarian unrest whilst taking measures against absentee landlords. He opposed Irish Home Rule, saying there could be no half-way house between Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom or becoming independent. From 1891 he led the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, serving under his uncle, Lord Salisbury, whose government won large majorities in 1895 and 1900. An esteemed debater, he was bored by the mundane tasks of party management. In July 1902, he succeeded his uncle as prime minister. In domestic policy he passed the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, which bought out most of the Anglo-Irish land owners. The Education Act 1902 had a major long-term impact in modernising the school system in England and Wales and provided financial support for schools operated by the Church of England and by the Catholic Church. Nonconformists were outraged and mobilised their voters, but were unable to reverse it. In foreign and defence policy, he oversaw reform of British defence policy and supported Jackie Fisher's naval innovations. He secured the Entente Cordiale with France, an alliance that isolated Germany. He cautiously embraced imperial preference as championed by Joseph Chamberlain, but resignations from the Cabinet over the abandonment of free trade left his party divided. He also suffered from public anger at the later stages of the Boer war (counter-insurgency warfare characterised as \"methods of barbarism\") and the importation of Chinese labour to South Africa (\"Chinese slavery\"). He resigned as prime minister in December 1905 and the following month the Conservatives suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 election, in which he lost his own seat. He soon re-entered Parliament and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition throughout the crisis over Lloyd George's 1909 budget, the narrow loss of two further General Elections in 1910, and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. He resigned as party leader in 1911. Balfour returned as First Lord of the Admiralty in Asquith's Coalition Government (1915\u201316). In December 1916, he became foreign secretary in David Lloyd George's coalition. He was frequently left out of the inner workings of foreign policy, although the Balfour Declaration on a Jewish homeland bore his name. He continued to serve in senior positions throughout the 1920s, and died on 19 March 1930 aged 81, having spent a vast inherited fortune. He never married. Balfour trained as a philosopherhe originated an argument against believing that human reason could determine truthand was seen as having a detached attitude to life, epitomised by a remark attributed to him: \"Nothing matters very much and few things matter at all\"."

Serving as a lawyer, judge, and politician in the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, he played a major role in the movement for Finnish independence, because he was one who presented the Declaration of Independence to the Parliament. In 1917\u20131918, Svinhufvud was the first Head of State of independent Finland, first as Chairman of the Senate and subsequently as Protector of State or Regent. He also served as Prime Minister from 1930 to 1931. As a conservative who was strong in his opposition to communism and the Left in general, Svinhufvud did not become a President embraced by all the people, although as the amiable Ukko-Pekka (\"Old Man Pekka\"), he did enjoy wide popularity. Svinhufvud's sharp line as a defender of Finland's legal rights during the period of autonomy was especially valued from the 1920s until the end of the World War II, unlike in later decades. Ever since communism and the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, appreciation of Svinhufvud has begun to increase."

His films are noted for their surrealism, melodramatic, and disturbing elements, often based in psychological fictions. Aronofsky attended Harvard University, where he studied film and social anthropology, and then the American Film Institute where he studied directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, which went on to become a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, the surrealist psychological thriller Pi, was shot in November 1997. The low-budget, $60,000 production, starring Sean Gullette, was sold to Artisan Entertainment for $1 million, and grossed over $3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. Aronofsky's follow-up, the psychological drama Requiem for a Dream, was based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. After writing the World War II horror film Below, Aronofsky began production on his third film, the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama The Fountain. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following. His fourth film, the sports drama The Wrestler, was released to critical acclaim and both of the film's stars, Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, received Academy Award nominations. In 2010, his fifth feature film, the psychological horror film Black Swan, received further critical acclaim and many accolades, being nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director; Natalie Portman won Best Actress for her performance in the film. Aronofsky also received nominations for Best Director at the Golden Globes, and a Directors Guild of America Award nomination for his work on Black Swan. Aronofsky's sixth film, the biblically inspired epic Noah, was released in 2014, becoming Aronofsky's first film to open at No.1 at the box office. His seventh film, the psychological horror mother!

Between the death of his father, in 1851, and the death of his grandfather, the 4th Earl of Rosebery, in 1868, he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Dalmeny. Rosebery first came to national attention in 1879 by sponsoring the successful Midlothian campaign of William Ewart Gladstone. He briefly was in charge of Scottish affairs. His most successful performance in office came as chairman of the London County Council in 1889. He entered the cabinet in 1885 and served twice as foreign minister, paying special attention to French and German affairs. He succeeded Gladstone as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party in 1894; the Liberals lost the 1895 election. He resigned the party leadership in 1896 and never again held political office. Rosebery was widely known as a brilliant orator, an outstanding sportsman and marksman, a writer and historian, connoisseur and collector. All of these activities attracted him more than politics, which grew boring and unattractive. Furthermore, he drifted to the right of the Liberal party and became a bitter critic of its policies. Winston Churchill, observing that he never adapted to democratic electoral competition, quipped: \"He would not stoop; he did not conquer.\" Rosebery was a Liberal Imperialist who favoured strong national defence and imperialism abroad and social reform at home, while being solidly anti-socialist.

In 1943 he joined the British army and after participating in landings at Salerno and Anzio, parachuted into Italy to organize resistance. As agent of the British Special Operations Executive, Salvadori played a central role in providing weapons supplies for partisan formations and in pushing the Action Party to cooperate with the Italian Monarchy after the \"svolta di Salerno\" (1944). For this service, he was awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Service Order. He served on the faculty of Smith College from 1945 until his retirement in 1973, with two notable breaks: in 1948-49 he was director of the Division of Political Science of UNESCO in France and in 1952 he worked as a political analyst for the Information Service of the Secretariat of NATO."

Fine (October 11, 1914\u00a0\u2013 March 26, 1993) was an American chess player, psychologist, university professor, and author of many books on both chess and psychology. He was one of the strongest chess players in the world from the mid-1930s until his retirement from chess in 1951. He was granted the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE in 1950, when titles were introduced. Fine's best result was his equal first place in the 1938 AVRO tournament, one of the strongest tournaments of all time. After the death of world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, Fine was one of six players invited to compete for the World Championship in 1948. He declined the invitation, however, and virtually retired from serious competition around that time, although he did play a few events until 1951. Fine won five medals (four gold) in three Chess Olympiads. He won the US Open all seven times he entered (1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1939, 1940, 1941).

He was the founder of his namesake Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute. Raised in Bannu, Ghulam Ishaq graduated from Peshawar University and entered the Indian Civil Service, opting for Pakistan after the independence in 1947. Appointed the first chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority by President Ayub Khan in 1961, Ghulam Ishaq also served as Finance Secretary from 1966 to 1970. A year later, he was appointed Governor of the State Bank by President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, before being made Defence Secretary in 1975, assisting with Pakistan's atomic bomb programme. He was retained by President Zia-ul-Haq as Finance Minister in 1977, overseeing the country's highest GDP growth average. Elected Chairman of the Senate in 1985, Ghulam Ishaq was elevated to the presidency after Zia's death in an air crash on 17 August 1988. He was elected president on 13 December, as the consensus candidate of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad and Pakistan People's Party. The oldest person to serve as president, Ghulam Ishaq played a hawkish role against Communist Afghanistan, while relations with the United States deteriorated following the Pressler amendment. Domestically, Ghulam Ishaq's term faced challenges: ethnic riots flared in Karachi, and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto accused him of frustrating her government as part of an alliance with conservative opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and the post-Zia military establishment. Ghulam Ishaq invoked the Eighth Amendment and dismissed Benazir's government after just 20 months, on charges of rampant corruption and misgovernance. Sharif was elected Prime Minister in 1990, but Ghulam Ishaq dismissed his government on similar charges three years later. The Supreme Court overturned the dismissal, but the gridlock ultimately led to both men resigning in 1993. Retiring from public service, Ghulam Ishaq served as rector of the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology in his native province, dying from pneumonia in 2006. He is viewed contentiously by Pakistani historians; he is credited for personal austerity, but criticized for wielding an autocratic presidency that ousted two governments."

Grant. Morrill was an accomplished politician serving in several elected and appointed offices throughout his lifetime. Morrill, as Secretary of Treasury, was devoted to hard currency rather than paper money. He dedicated himself to serve the public good rather than party interests. Morrill was popularly received as Treasury Secretary by the American press and Wall Street, and was known for his financial and political integrity.  Morrill was President Grant's fourth and last Secretary of the Treasury. A native of Maine, Morrill was educated in public school and after briefly attending Waterville College served as principal of a private school in New York. He studied law and passed the bar in 1839, afterwards setting up law practices in Readfield and Augusta, Maine.  Morrill, known for his eloquent speaking, soon become popular among Democratic friends advocating temperance.  Morrill was elected to Maine's House of Representatives in 1854 as a Democrat and served as Chairman of the Maine Democratic Party. However, as the nation divided over slavery during the 1850s, Morrill's politics changed and he went over to the Republican Party for the sole reason that the Republicans were opposed to the expansion of slavery. He was elected Maine's state senator in 1856 as a Republican, and elected Governor of Maine in 1858, serving until 1861 during the outbreak of the American Civil War. Morrill was elected Maine's U.S. Senator in 1861 when a vacancy opened in the U.S. Senate, after Sen. Hannibal Hamlin assumed the office of Vice President under President Abraham Lincoln.  Morrill's extended tenure for almost 15 years as U.S. Senator took place during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Morrill sponsored legislation that outlawed slavery in Washington D.C. and advocated education and suffrage for African American freedmen. In 1876, Sen. Morrill was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President Grant, to fill in a vacancy after Sec. Benjamin Bristow resigned from office. His political rival James G. Blaine was appointed Maine's Senator after Morrill resigned from the Senate to accept the position of Secretary of Treasury.  Morrill's tenure was less than a year. Upon his retirement from the Treasury Department, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Morrill to the Collector of Customs in Portland, Maine, where he held this position until his death in 1883."

He was the son of Samuel Gilman Brown (1813\u20131885), president of Hamilton College from 1867 to 1881, and the grandson of Francis Brown, whose removal from the presidency of Dartmouth College and later restoration were incidental to the famous Dartmouth College case. The younger Francis graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover in 1866, from Dartmouth in 1870 and from the Union Theological Seminary in 1877, and then studied in Berlin. In 1879 he became instructor in biblical philology at the Union Theological Seminary, in 1881 an associate professor of the same subject, and in 1890 Davenport Professor of Hebrew and the cognate Languages. Brown's published works won him an honorary doctorate of Divinity from the University of Glasgow (1901), and a D.Litt. from the University of Oxford, as well as honorary doctorates from Dartmouth and Yale. The works are, with the exception of The Christian Point of View (1902; with Profs. A. C. McGiffert and G. W. Knox), almost purely linguistic and lexical, and include Assyriology: its Use and Abuse in Old Testament Study (1885), and the important revision of Gesenius' Lexicon, undertaken with S. R.

As part of this effort, he developed the Cilk multithreaded language.  He invented the fat-tree interconnection network, a hardware-universal interconnection network used in many supercomputers, including the Connection Machine CM5, for which he was network architect.  He helped pioneer the development of VLSI theory, including the retiming method of digital optimization with James B. Saxe and systolic arrays with H. T. Kung.  He conceived of the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which are algorithms that have no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length, but nevertheless use cache near-optimally.  He developed the Cilk language for multithreaded programming, which uses a provably good work-stealing algorithm for scheduling.  Leiserson coauthored the standard algorithms textbook Introduction to Algorithms together with Thomas H. Cormen, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Leiserson received a B.S. degree in computer science and mathematics from Yale University in 1975 and a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1981, where his advisors were Jon Bentley and H. T. Kung. He then joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is now a Professor.  In addition, he is a principal in the Theory of Computation research group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and he was formerly Director of Research and Director of System Architecture for Akamai Technologies.  He was Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Cilk Arts, Inc., a start-up that developed Cilk technology for multicore computing applications.  (Cilk Arts, Inc. was acquired by Intel in 2009.) Leiserson's dissertation, Area-Efficient VLSI Computation, won the first ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.  In 1985, the National Science Foundation awarded him a Presidential Young Investigator Award.  He is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  He received the 2014 Taylor L.

        "content": "Ernst Hjalmar Waloddi Weibull (18 June 1887 \u2013 12 October 1979) was a Swedish engineer, scientist, and mathematician. Weibull came from a family that had strong ties to Scania. He was a cousin of the historian brothers Lauritz, Carl Gustaf and Curt Weibull. He joined the Swedish Coast Guard in 1905 as a midshipman. Weibull moved up the ranks with promotion to sublieutenant in 1907, Captain in 1916 and Major in 1940. While in the coast guard he took courses at the Royal Institute of Technology. In 1924 he graduated and became a full professor. Weibull obtained his doctorate from the University of Uppsala in 1932. He was employed in Swedish and German industry as a consulting engineer. In 1914, while on expeditions to the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean on the research ship Albatross, Weibull wrote his first paper on the propagation of explosive waves. He developed the technique of using explosive charges to determine the type of ocean bottom sediments and their thickness. The same technique is still used today in offshore oil exploration. In 1939 he published his paper on the Weibull distribution in probability theory and statistics. In 1941 he received a personal research professorship in Engineering Physics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm from the arms producer Bofors. Weibull published many papers on strength of materials, fatigue, rupture in solids, bearings, and of course, the Weibull distribution, as well as one book on fatigue analysis in 1961. 27 of these papers were reports to the US Air Force at Wilbur Wright Field on Weibull analysis. In 1951 he presented his paper on the Weibull distribution to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), using seven case studies. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers awarded Weibull their gold medal in 1972. The Great Gold Medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences was personally presented to him by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in 1978. Weibull died on 12 October 1979 in Annecy, France."

Early in his career, he became known for his research at Yale's Cowles Foundation in the first half of the 1960s on the sources of economic growth. His demonstration of the golden rule savings rate, a concept related to work by John von Neumann, started a wave of research on how much a nation should spend on present consumption rather than save and invest for future generations. Phelps was at the University of Pennsylvania from 1966 to 1971 and moved to Columbia University in 1971. His most seminal work inserted a microfoundation, one featuring imperfect information, incomplete knowledge and expectations about wages and prices, to support a macroeconomic theory of employment determination and price-wage dynamics. That led to his development of the natural rate of unemployment: its existence and the mechanism governing its size. In the early 2000s, he turned to the study of business innovation. He is the founding director, since 2001, of Columbia's Center on Capitalism and Society. He was McVickar Professor of Political Economy at Columbia from 1982 to 2021. On January 1, 2022, his title changed to McVickar Professor Emeritus of Political Economy."

She, along with fellow students of National Taiwan University Bai Xianyong, Wang Wenxing, and Chen Rouxi, created the literary magazine Modern Literature (Xiandai wenxue) in 1960, under the guidance of Professor Hsia Tsi-an. She attended graduate school in the United States. Ouyang's short stories are modernist in the sense that they employ novelistic techniques of literary modernism: stream of consciousness, multiple perspective narration, symbolism, probing of psychological depths instead of drawing social canvases.  Such techniques flourished briefly in Taiwan during the 1960s and were in response to the socio-political \"Recover the Mainland\" trend of the 1940s and 1950s. Ouyang's writing is experimental as well in terms of challenging social mores, especially concerning sex. Her stories are filled with violence, sexuality and abnormal psychology. In terms of literary merit, her writing is easily digestible, soap-operatic, and melodramatic. Ouyang is also a noted literary critic. She has produced a book-length study of Taipei People (see Pai Hsien-yung)."

Born in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1951, Loesch attended Antioch College, where, as an anti-war advocate, she pursued an education in non-violent social change. Within 3 months she was in Delano, California working for Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers (UFW). She later worked in organizing grape and lettuce boycotts in Detroit and Cleveland in support of agricultural labor strikes in California. In 1972 Loesch became one of the founding members of the Pax (Peace) Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, joining Sr. Mary Lou Kownacki, OSB, in forming a Catholic feminist peace community. This group, comprising Benedictine Sisters and lay associates, was organized more or less on the Catholic Worker model, combining activism with the Works of Mercy (soup kitchen, homeless shelter work. etc.) The Pax Center, together with other Catholic antiwar activist groups, soon morphed into Pax Christi USA, the American affiliate of Pax Christi, an international Catholic peace movement. In the late 1970s, Loesch became an activist associated with the \"Mobilization for Survival\", a coalition which opposed nuclear weapons. She became convinced that abortion and the nuclear arms race were moral equivalents, and advocated partnership between the peace and pro-life movements. In 1979, she founded the \"bridge\" organization Prolifers for Survival, which operated until 1987. She has written extensively on these and related subjects. The larger Consistent Life Ethic movement grew partly out of her writing and activism. Her articles or essays (many searchable via \"Juli Loesch\" or \"Juli Loesch Wiley\") have appeared in, among other publications, the New Oxford Review, the National Catholic Reporter, the National Catholic Register, Consistent Life, Commonweal, Sojourners, Caelum et Terra, and Touchstone.

        "content": "Henry Balfour Gardiner (7 November 1877 \u2013 28 June 1950) was a British musician, composer, and teacher. He was born at Kensington (London). Between his conventional education at Charterhouse School and New College, Oxford, where he obtained only a pass degree, Gardiner was a piano student at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, where he was taught by Iwan Knorr and Lazzaro Uzielli, who had been a pupil of Clara Schumann. He belonged to the Frankfurt Group, a circle of composers who studied at the Hoch Conservatory in the late 1890s. With George Gardiner (no relation) he collected folk songs in Hampshire (1905\u20131906), taught music briefly at Winchester College (1907), and composed. His works included compositions in a variety of genres, including two symphonies (No 2 premiered at the Proms in 1908), but many of his scores, including the symphonies, are lost and only a very limited amount of his music survives. His best-known work Evening Hymn (1908), a setting of the compline hymn \"Te lucis ante terminum\", is a lush, romantic work for eight-part choir and organ, of dense harmonies. For most of the time, it sits in four parts, though the treble, alto, tenor, and bass parts all subdivide at various points. It is considered a classic of the English choral repertoire and is still regularly performed as an anthem at Evensong in Anglican churches. The fame of this work has overshadowed his surviving orchestral works, which include Overture to a Comedy (1906, revised 1911), the Percy Grainger-like Shepherd Fennell's Dance (1911) (once a favourite at the Proms, chalking up 35 performances between 1911 and 1951), and the Delius-like A Berkshire Idyll, the latter written in 1913 at Field House, Ashampstead Green in Berkshire, where he lived between 1911 and 1930. The first performance of the Idyll (along with two other unpublished pieces, Philomela and the choral setting April), took place on 6 May 1955 at the Royal Festival Hall, 42 years after its completion. It was recorded in 2017 for the first time. Also surviving are a number of short piano works and songs. Gardiner's most important work, possibly, was his promotion of the music of contemporary British and colonial composers, particularly through a series of concerts he personally financed at Queen's Hall London in 1912 to 1913. The composers represented included Arnold Bax, Frederic Austin, Gustav Holst, Percy Grainger, Roger Quilter, Cyril Scott and Norman O'Neill. (The last four had also studied with him at Frankfurt.) Gardiner was very generous with his personal fortune, paying for a private benefit performance of The Planets for Holst in 1918 and purchasing Frederick Delius's house at Grez-sur-Loing to enable him to continue living in it at the end of his life. In the early 1920s he also became a patron of Charles Kennedy Scott, conductor and founder of the Philharmonic Choir which was the predecessor of the present London Philharmonic Choir. Gardiner gave up composing in 1925 largely because he was intensely self-critical: much of his lost music was probably destroyed by him. Thereafter, he devoted himself to a pioneering afforestation programme on his Dorset pig farm. He died in Salisbury. He was the great-uncle of the conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner."

He worked as a policy advisor in the George W. Bush administration before serving as Solicitor General of Texas from 2003 to 2008. In 2012, Cruz was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first Hispanic-American to serve as a U.S. senator from Texas. In the Senate, Cruz has taken consistently conservative positions on economic and social policy; he played a leading role in the 2013 United States federal government shutdown, seeking to force Congress and President Barack Obama to defund the Affordable Care Act. He was reelected in a close Senate race in 2018 against Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke. In 2016, Cruz ran for president of the United States, placing second behind Donald Trump in the Republican primaries. The competition for the Republican presidential nomination between Trump and Cruz was deeply acrimonious and characterized by a series of public personal attacks. While Cruz initially declined to endorse Trump's campaign once he won the nomination, he became a staunch Trump supporter during the latter's presidency. After the January 2021 Capitol attack, Cruz provoked widespread political and popular backlash for objecting to the certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election and giving credence to the false claim that the election was stolen from Trump."

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1884 and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Second Artillery. Early in his career he made himself an authority on ordnance. In 1900, then-Captain Lewis was sent by Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin to Europe to study that subject, his report resulting in the re-armament of the field artillery. By successive promotions, he rose to the rank of colonel in the Coast Artillery Corps in August 1913, and was retired the next month for disability incurred in line of duty. In 1911, he refined an original machine gun design of Samuel Maclean and began active marketing of type which came to be known simply as the \"Lewis Gun\", which was used in World War I by the Allied armies, the United States Navy, and the airplanes of the United States and Allies.  Initially the United States Army was not interested in his new gun, but after the British and French had bought more than 100,000 for use in the trenches in France, the US Army did purchase them. He declined the royalties\u2014amounting to at least $1,000,000\u2014on guns made for the United States after it entered the war. His other inventions included a time-interval clock and bell system of signals, a replotting and relocating system for coast batteries, an automatic sight, quick-reading mechanical verniers for use in coast defenses, electric car lighting, and windmill electric lighting systems. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1919. Lewis died of a myocardial infarction at the Lackawanna Railroad terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, while waiting for a train to his home in Montclair.  He is buried at the West Point Cemetery on the grounds of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York."

As a school boy, he conducted water analysis with the Leeds City Analyst. He studied chemistry at the University of Leeds with Julius B. Cohen, and then he worked with Albrecht Kossel on arginase at the University of Heidelberg. He joined Columbia University in 1905, working in the lab of Christian Herter. During his work on amino acids he obtained his PhD from Leeds. In 1905, he was one of the first scientists to successfully synthesise adrenaline in the laboratory (see: History of catecholamine research). In 1914 he went back to England to offer his service with the war effort. Due to a request for a chemist by Alexis Carrel to the Rockefeller Institute, Dakin joined Carrel in 1916 at a temporary hospital in Compi\u00e8gne. There they developed the Carrel\u2013Dakin method of wound treatments. This consisted of intermittently irrigating the wound with Dakin's solution, a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in common liquid bleach products) and boric acid.  In the process, he analyzed more than 200 candidate substances, and developed quantitative methods to evaluate their effectiveness for disinfection and wound healing. The solution is still widely used for that purpose, as of 2013. The World War I era Rockefeller War Demonstration Hospital (United States Army Auxiliary Hospital No. 1) was created, in part, to promote the Carrel\u2013Dakin method: \"The war demonstration hospital of the Rockefeller Institute was planned as a school in which to teach military surgeons the principles of and art of applying the Carrel-Dakin treatment.\" After he married the widow of Christian Herter in 1916, he worked in his private laboratory in Scarsdale, New York and had several close collaborations with other scientists. His main working fields were amino acids and enzymes. The extraction of amino acids from hydrolyzed peptides by butanol was invented by him. He also was interested in organic chemistry and synthesis, and devised the Dakin reaction and the Dakin\u2013West reaction. He died shortly after the death of his wife in early 1952."

        "content": "Tod Dockstader (March 20, 1932 \u2013 February 27, 2015) was an American composer of electronic music, and particularly musique concr\u00e8te. Dockstader was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. He studied painting and film while at the University of Minnesota, before moving to Hollywood in 1955, to become an apprentice film editor. He moved into work as a sound engineer in 1958, and apprenticed at Gotham Recording Studios, where he first started composing. Around this same time he also worked for Terrytoons alongside Gene Deitch. From 1961 to 1962, when Deitch directed thirteen new Tom and Jerry shorts, Dockstader was responsible for creating the unusual, heavily reverberated sound effects heard throughout them; he also wrote the shorts Mouse into Space and Landing Stripling. Dockstader's first record, Eight Electronic Pieces, was released in 1960, and was later used as the soundtrack to Federico Fellini's Fellini Satyricon (1969). He continued to create music throughout the first half of that decade, working principally with tape manipulation effects. In 1966 Owl Records released four albums of his work from this period including what many consider to be Dockstader's masterpiece, Quatermass. He achieved modest recognition and radio play alongside the likes of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and John Cage. In 1961, he applied to use the facilities at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and was denied access in separate rejection letters penned by Vladimir Ussachevsky and Milton Babbitt. Ussachevsky\u2019s official reason was the \u201coverstrained\u201d scheduling of the studios, although many suspect that Dockstader\u2019s lack of academic training was a factor in the decision. After leaving Gotham Recording Studios in the late 1960s he formed the audio-visual service Westport Communications Group along with business partner, and former Gotham executive, Fred Hertz. The company focused on corporate clients and produced award-winning educational films for the American Heritage series. Dockstader was also a prolific writer, with several articles published by Electronic Music Review and The Musical Quarterly. In the early 1990s, Starkland re-released most of the content of Dockstader\u2019s out-of-print Owl records, along with previously unreleased material. The two CDs brought new, significant acclaim to the composer. The Washington Post called Dockstader  \"a highly imaginative pioneer,\" and The Wire concluded, \"The obsessive care with which Starkland have compiled these extraordinary recordings should ensure that Dockstader will be remembered as the innovative, visionary figure he undoubtedly was.\" Reinvigorated, Dockstader returned to music at the start of the 21st century, adopting computer composition in favor of tapes. New CDs appeared from Sub Rosa and ReR Megacorp. Work on a documentary about his life, Unlocking Dockstader, was begun in 2011, however lack of funding has stalled the project. He died in Arlington, Massachusetts, on February 27, 2015, at the age of 82. In 2016, Starkland released From the Archives, a CD that premiered 15 works selected from the unexpected discovery of 4,200 sound files found on Dockstader's private computer after his death. Created from 2000-2008, these were among the last pieces composed by Dockstader, before dementia put an end to his studio work."

From 1983 until 1986, he lived in New York City, where he worked as a freelance composer/arranger and as a publications editor with the S.A. Music Bureau. Since his return to the U.K., he has worked regularly as an arranger for BBC Television and Radio and has specialised in composition for brass band. Since the publication of Dimensions (1983), he has carved out a niche as an outstanding arranger for brass bands, and a leading figure amongst contemporary band composers. His original compositions, which include The Essence of Time, Montage and Journey to the Centre of the Earth, are performed worldwide and have been selected as test-pieces for National Championships in Australia, New Zealand, North America and across Europe. His music for wind and concert band has been recorded and performed by many of the world\u2019s leading ensembles, including the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra and the Royal Norwegian Navy Band. Harrison's Dream, commissioned by the United States Air Force Band, Washington D.C., won the 2002 American Bandmasters Association Ostwald Award for composition.

The same year he became assistant to Carl Henrik Boheman in the Zoological department of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, where, in 1867, he was appointed keeper with the title of professor. He made collecting trips in Sweden and throughout Europe and visited other museums including the collection of Johan Christian Fabricius in Kiel. His study of the Fabrician types resulted in his \"Hemiptera Fabriciana\". A significant part of St\u00e5l's work was the study of insects collected from Caffraria, the majority of which were poorly understood at the time. Although St\u00e5l, who was regarded as the world's foremost worker on Hemiptera, published most on this order, he also worked on Orthoptera and to a lesser extent on Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, naming well over 1000 new genera and over 1500 new species over his brief career.

He completed secondary education in Kherson, Ukraine; then studied for a year in Rostov, Russia and moved to Saint Petersburg seeking university degree. There he studied in several technical universities. Engineering however did not attract Shatunovsky and he dedicated himself to mathematics, voluntarily attending lectures by Chebyshev. Shatunovsky could not complete any university program due to lack of funds. He later attempted to obtain a university degree in Switzerland, but failed for the same reason. After returning from Switzerland, he lived in small Russian towns, earning by private lessons. In the meantime, he wrote his first mathematical papers and sent some of them to Odessa University. Their quality was acknowledged; Shatunovsky was admitted to the university, received financial support, obtained a degree and was appointed as staff member in 1905. In 1917, he became a professor and continued working at the Odessa University through the rest of his life. Shatunovsky focused on several topics in mathematical analysis and algebra, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. Independently from Hilbert, he developed a similar axiomatic theory and applied it in geometry, algebra, Galois theory and analysis. However, most of his activity was devoted to teaching at Odessa University and writing associated books and study materials. Shatunovsky died in 1929 from stomach cancer two days after his 70th birthday. Despite severe pain associated with his illness, he kept his usual sense of humor and continued to lecture almost until the day he died. He was remembered by his students and colleagues for his original approach to mathematical problems and ability to popularize the most complex mathematical ideas."

Born in Lee, New Hampshire, he was the son of John Fabyan Parrott. He graduated with honors from the United States Military Academy, third of the Class of 1824.  Parrott was assigned to the 3rd U.S. Artillery as a second lieutenant. He remained at West Point as an instructor until 1829, then had garrison duty and served as a staff officer in operations against the Creek Indians early in 1836 before moving to Washington, D.C., in July as Captain of Ordnance. He resigned from the army four months later to become the superintendent the West Point Iron and Cannon Foundry in Cold Spring, New York, with which he would be associated for the remainder of his life. In 1839 he married Mary Kemble, sister of Gouverneur Kemble, founder of the ironworks. While employed at West Point, he and his brother Peter Parrott also assumed management of the operation of the Kemble-owned furnaces in Orange County, New York. The brothers purchased a \u2153 interest in Greenwood Furnace from a minority holder in 1837, and bought it entirely from the Kembles in 1839. In 1860 he produced the Parrott rifle, an innovative rifled cannon which was manufactured in several sizes. The largest weighed 26,000\u00a0lb (11,800\u00a0kg) and fired a projectile that weighed 300\u00a0lb (140\u00a0kg). Parrott guns were extensively employed during the American Civil War by both the Union and Confederate armies. In 1867 Parrott ended his superintendency of the West Point Foundry to concentrate on the ironworks in Orange County. However, he continued to experiment with artillery shells and fuses at West Point until his death at Cold Spring at the age of 73."

One Egan's accomplishments of the early seventies was to deliver about 25 non-episcopal leaders of the Catholic Church in the country to a PADRES-sponsored meeting held at the Mexican American Cultural Center (now called the Mexican American Catholic College) in San Antonio, Texas.  The focus of the meeting was to garner greater recognition and respect for the \"Hispanic Agenda\" within the institutions of the Catholic Church in the United States. John Joseph Egan figures prominently in the 2009 book Family Properties: Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America by Beryl Satter. The book discusses Egan's work co-founding, then leading, the Contract Buyers League, which fought the discriminatory real estate practice known as \"contract selling\" that was used to exploit newly urbanized black home buyers. The organization United Power for Action and Justice was co-founded by Egan. The Monsignor John J. Egan Office of Urban Education and Community Partnerships, at DePaul University, is named in his honor. Egan's papers are housed in the manuscript collection at the University of Notre Dame Archives."

Karen is two years older than Michelle and was an elite figure skater herself. The Kwan sisters began figure skating at the same time and trained and competed against each other for years. Karen, like Michelle, was coached by Frank Carroll at the Lake Arrowhead training center. Though Karen's results never quite matched Michelle's, she was known for her long legs and arms that added a lyrical style and an elegant dimension to her skating.  She also had consistent triple jumps and good technical spins. Karen also represented the United States at numerous international skating events, and won the bronze medal at the 1996 Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany.  At  tall, Karen stands about  taller than Michelle.  She retired in 1997 to focus on school.  She attended Boston University. Since ending her competitive skating career, Kwan has maintained her connection to the sport. She has worked as a choreographer and is the skating director at the East West Skating Palace, in Artesia, California. The Kwan family owns and operates the rink. Kwan graduated from Boston University in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in communications.

        "title": "Richard G. Stern_Summary",
        "content": "Richard Gustave Stern (February 25, 1928 \u2013 January 24, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and educator. Stern was born in New York City on February 25, 1928. He attended the University of North Carolina from which he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1947. After a year working in Indiana, Florida and New York City, he went to Harvard University where he received an MA in English Literature. In 1949, he taught as a Fulbright Scholar in Versailles, France. From 1950 to 1951 he was an assistant professor and taught at Heidelberg University. From 1952 to 1954, he was a member of the Iowa Writer's Workshop and received a PhD from the University of Iowa in 1954. After a year teaching at Connecticut College in New London, he came to the University of Chicago where he taught from 1955 to 2002. He retired as Helen A Regenstein Professor of English and American Literature in 2004. During his tenure at the University of Chicago, Stern was allegedly involved in the \"suppression\" of the \"beat edition\" of the Chicago Review (winter edition of 1958). At the time the Chicago Review was a student/faculty literary publication published by the University of Chicago. The editor then was Irving Rosenthal. The \"beat edition\" of the Review was to include excerpts from Naked Lunch, by William S. Burroughs, and a few Jack Kerouac stories. According to Rosenthal, Stern, along with Joshua Taylor, another faculty member, wanted to suppress the winter issue, being himself \"so quick to protect the administration.\" (For reference to the case of censorship See The Beats, A Literary Reference, by Matt Theado, pp.\u00a0103, 104, 105, under the chapter titled \"The Chicago Review and a Case of Censorship.\") Stern's own account of the \"so-called suppression\" appeared in \"How I Think I Got to Think the Way I Think\" in The Republic of Letters (reprinted in Still on Call, Stern's  \"orderly miscellany\"). It recounts Stern's successful attempt not only to save the review (the University President at the time, Lawrence A. Kimpton, wished to stop funding the journal) but to keep the following issue from dropping any of the pieces (of Naked Lunch and other \"beat\" works) that had been accepted. Rosenthal and Paul Carroll, the Review's co- editors, founded Big Table, using submissions which Stern and the other student editors claimed belonged to the Review. (Oddly, Stern was invited to and did read at a fund-raiser for Big Table and published what he read in its second issue.)  Furthermore, the previous issue of the Review included an excerpt from Naked Lunch along with work by other Beats. In 1960, Stern published his first novel, Golk,  then the novels Europe or Up and Down with Baggish and Schreiber (1961), In Any Case (1962), Stitch (1965), Other Men's Daughters (1973), Natural Shocks (1978), A Father's Words (1986), and Pacific Tremors (2001). There also have been short story collections culminating in his collected stories, Almonds to Zhoof published in 2004, his 21st book. Of this last book, a reviewer in the New Republic called Stern \"the best American author of whom you have never heard.\" This indeed has been the tag associated with Mr. Stern for the last quarter of a century. \"I was a has-been before I'd been a been,\" was a well-known self-deprecation as was the word of Richard Schickel that Mr. Stern \"was almost famous for not being famous\". Stern published another collection of essays, What is What Was, in 2002.  Like his other essay collections, this one demonstrates that his astute observations in fiction are equal to, and derived from, his acute views on news and culture. In 1985, Stern received the Medal of Merit for the Novel, awarded to a novelist every six years by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his many other awards was the Heartland Award for the best work of non-fiction which Stern received for his memoir, Sistermony, published in 1995. Stern has been praised by many of the great writers and critics of the last fifty years, among them Anthony Burgess, Flannery O'Connor, Howard Nemerov, Thomas Berger, Hugh Kenner, Sven Birkerts, and Richard Ellmann, as well as his close friends Tom Rogers, Saul Bellow, Donald Justice, and Philip Roth (see Stern's essay \"Glimpse, Encounter, Acquaintance, Friendship\" in Sewanee Review, Winter 2009).  He also enjoyed literary acquaintances and friendships with such figures as Samuel Beckett, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, Lillian Hellman, and Jorge Luis Borges.  Some of Stern's students at the University of Chicago went on to become distinguished writers themselves such as Douglas Unger, Robert Coover, Austin Wright, Campbell McGrath, Peter LaSalle, and Alane Rollings, as well as the well-known journalists Seymour Hersh, David Brooks and Mike Taibbi. At 80, Stern continued to write, and his books remain in print through Northwestern University Press and University of Chicago Press.  From 2006 onwards he maintained a blog with The New Republic. The most recent book about Stern and his work was published in 2001: The Writings of Richard Stern: The Education of an Intellectual Everyman, by David Garrett Izzo (McFarland Publishing).  See also James Schiffer's study, Richard Stern, published by Twayne/Macmillan in 1993."

Born on a farm near Plainview, Nebraska, he graduated from the Plainview High School in 1911 and from Loyola Medical School in Chicago in 1918. He then taught rural school in Plainview from 1911 to 1913. He was a member of the United States Medical Reserve Corps. He was a surgeon and practiced medicine in Kimball, Nebraska from 1919 to 1942. He was also a farmer and the mayor of Kimball in 1933 and 1934. He was a member of the Nebraska unicameral legislature from 1937 to 1941. He ran against Dwight Griswold and lost in the Republican gubernatorial primary of 1940.  Dwight Griswold then went on to become governor of Nebraska. He was the state health director in 1941 and 1942. In 1942 he gave up his medical practices and ran for the Seventy-eighth Congress. He was elected and then was reelected seven times (January 3, 1943 \u2013 January 3, 1959) to represent Nebraska's 4th district in the House of Representatives as a Republican. Miller voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. During his time in the Eighty-third Congress, he was the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. In 1944 Rep. Miller released private political correspondence he had exchanged with General Douglas MacArthur. Some experts felt it ruined any chance for MacArthur to receive the Republican presidential nomination that year as MacArthur had not intended for his comments to be made public. He authored the Sexual Psychopath Law in 1948 for DC, nicknamed the \u201cMiller Law\u201d, and which made sodomy punishable by twenty years in prison. Additionally those arrested had to undergo psychiatric assessment and if they were regarded as not having control of their (homosexual) sexual impulses then they could be detained indefinitely in the criminal ward of the Washington psychiatric hospital until \u201crecovered\u201d and without recourse first to the courts. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1958 to the Eighty-sixth Congress. He then became the director of the Office of Saline Water in the Department of the Interior from February 1959 to January 1961. He died in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and is buried in Parklawn Cemetery in Rockville, Maryland."

Daniloff (born December 30, 1934) is an American journalist who graduated from Harvard University and was most prominent in the 1980s for his reporting on the Soviet Union. Being a Moscow correspondent for a U.S. Magazine, Daniloff came to wider international attention on September 2, 1986, after he was arrested in Moscow by the KGB and accused of espionage. On September 7, 1986, Daniloff was notified of a charge and had a proceeding scheduled for 2 pm at Lefortovo Prison in Moscow no other information was known at the time about who or what happened during the proceedings. The Reagan administration took the position that the Soviets had arrested Daniloff without cause, in retaliation for the arrest three days earlier of Gennadi Zakharov, an employee of the Soviet UN Mission. The Soviets initially contended that Daniloff had confidential government documents on him when he was arrested. After intense discussion between the governments, on September 23 Daniloff was allowed to leave the Soviet Union without charges, Zakharov was allowed to leave the U.S. after pleading nolo contendere, and Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov was released to the West. However, the diplomatic crisis did not end there. Expulsions of diplomats and suspected spies escalated to the point that by the end of October 1986, 100 Soviets, including a further 80 suspected Soviet intelligence agents, were expelled by the U.S. The Soviets expelled ten U.S. diplomats and withdrew all 260 of the Russian support staff working for the U.S. embassy in Moscow. Daniloff later contended in his autobiography, Two Lives, One Russia, that he had never held classified documents, and that the KGB had created false information. Daniloff became an instructor at Northeastern University's School of Journalism, and in 1992 he was named director of the school. He was also one of the co-authors of the book The Oath, a biography of Khassan Baiev. Daniloff's grandfather, general Yuri Danilov, was a chief of operations of Russian Imperial Army general-headquarters during World War I."

His associates, Bishop and Nelms, presented the procedure and results four years after his death at a medical meeting in 1929 and published it the following year. Its simplicity and effectiveness made the Pomeroy procedure a common choice for female sterilization that is still being used today.

An immunologist, he was the co-discoverer, with Peter Medawar and Rupert Billingham, of acquired immunological tolerance. They injected cells from donor mice into fetal mice, and later neonatal mice, which would as adults receive donor skin grafts without rejection. Brent was born Lothar Baruch, in K\u00f6slin, Germany (now Koszalin, Poland), to German Jewish parents, Charlotte (Rosenthal) and Arthur Baruch. To avoid persecution in the largely non-Jewish K\u00f6slin, his family placed him in the Jewish Orphanage Berlin-Pankow in Berlin in 1936. In 1938, at age 13, to escape the rising anti-Semitism of the Sturmabteilung (Storm Troopers) and teachers, Brent was sent to England on the first of the Kindertransports and became a pupil at Anna Essinger's Bunce Court School. His parents and older sister stayed behind in Germany. Because his status as a German national would have made him liable to execution in the event of capture, he was advised to change his name. After the war, he found out that his parents were sent to Riga, Latvia, and executed. There are three stolpersteine for his parents and sister in Berlin. After the war, he became a British citizen and enrolled at University of Birmingham where he was president of the Guild of Undergraduates in 1950\u20131951. He received his Ph.D. at University College London. As a secular Jew who escaped the Holocaust, Brent was highly critical of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. In 2012 he was interviewed and filmed for the documentary The Essential Link: The Story of Wilfrid Israel by Yonatan Nir, in which he talked about his Kindertransport experience. He was a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology. Brent died in December 2019, at the age of 94. He was posthumously appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to Holocaust education."

After attending The Hotchkiss School, he graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in comparative literature from Hamilton College in 1985.  Finch then pursued an M.F.A. in sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating in 1989. The first retrospective of his work, which ended in March 2008, was assembled at MASS MoCA in North Adams, MA. He currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Finch produces work in a wide variety of mediums, including watercolor, photography, glass, electronics, video and fluorescent lights. He is perhaps best known for dealing with the elusive concepts of memory and perception through light installations. After measuring with a colorimeter the light that exist naturally in a specific place and time, Finch's re-constructs the luminosity of the location through artificial means. For example, Moonlight (Luna County, New Mexico, July 13, 2003), replicates the exact light of the full moon that shone over the desert of Luna County, New Mexico on the evening of July 13, 2003. Creative Time, Friends of the High Line, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation commissioned The River That Flows Both Ways to Spencer Finch as the inaugural art installation for the High Line Park. The work is integrated into the window bays of the former Nabisco Factory loading dock, as a series of 700 purple and grey colored glass panes. Each color is exactly calibrated to match the center pixel of 700 digital pictures, one taken every minute, of the Hudson River, therefore presenting an extended portrait of the river that gives the work its name.  Creative Time worked with the artist to realize the site-specific concept that emerged when he saw the rusted, disused mullions of the old factory, which metal and glass specialists Jaroff Design helped to prepare and reinstall. Finch was chosen to create the only work of art commissioned for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.  For his work, \"Trying To Remember the Color of the Sky on That September Morning,\" Finch hand-painted 2,983 squares of Fabriano paper \u2014 one square in a unique shade of blue for every person killed in the September 11 attacks and in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center."

According to research  published by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Gompert was educated at Adelphi Academy, Pratt Institute, and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. The Landmarks Commission report on Gompert was included in its study of its decision to grant landmark status to the building that once housed The High School of Music & Art. It states: \"After employment in the firms of McKim, Mead & White, Maynicke & Franke, and George Edward Harding & Gooch, he established his own practice around 1906 and specialized in the design of commercial and institutional buildings. He was elected president of the Brooklyn chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1923. Gompert was hired in February 1923 by the New York City Board of Education as an expert to assist in the reorganization of the Bureau of Construction and Maintenance and to facilitate the construction of public schools; his initial six-month contract gave him the 'powers and duties of Superintendent of School Buildings.' \"According to The New York Times, Gompert had 'much experience in the directing of large building construction enterprises.' After a six-month extension of his contract, Gompert was appointed in January 1924 to the position of Architect and Superintendent of School Buildings for the Board of Education, and became the third-highest paid official in the administration of Mayor John Francis Hylan. \"Gompert was the first successor to the noted Charles B.J. Snyder, Superintendent of School Buildings from 1891 until January 1, 1923, who had been responsible for the vast school construction program following the consolidation of New York City in 1898, and had been 'virtually forced out of the post under pressure by. . . Mayor Hylan.' \"To alleviate the serious overcrowding in the schools caused by immigration after World War I, New York City undertook another extensive program of school construction in the mid-1920s. Gompert was forced to contend with a significant shortage of bricklayers in the citywide building industry, as well as a lack of interest on the part of major construction firms in bidding on public school construction projects. He attempted to bring about economy and change in the process of school construction, including standardizing design and construction, employing general contracts instead of individual construction contracts, and instituting double shifts to shorten construction time. In 1925, however, charges began to surface, first by a mayoral candidate, that many of the schools constructed under Gompert were defective. By the end of 1927, three separate investigations were underway and Gompert resigned in December. Former Mayor Hylan responded to critics that Gompert was under attack because he had 'built too many schools to suit those that do not want the"

In 1680 he accepted an offer from John III Sobieski, the king of Poland, returning to Poland and taking the position of the king's chaplain, mathematician, clock maker, librarian, and tutor of the king's son, Jakub. He wrote many scientific papers, mainly on mathematics and mechanics, but also on physics, astronomy and philosophy. The best known of his works, Observationes Cyclometricae ad facilitandam Praxin accommodatae, is devoted to the squaring the circle (or alternatively, the quadrature of the circle) and was published in 1685 in the leading scientific periodical of the time, Acta Eruditorum. He also found a famous approximation of \u03c0 today called Kocha\u0144ski's approximation: Kocha\u0144ski cooperated and corresponded with many scientists, Johannes Hevelius and Gottfried Leibniz among them. He was apparently the only one of the contemporary Poles to know elements of the newly invented calculus. As a mechanic he was a renowned clock maker. He suggested replacing the clock's pendulum with a spring, and standardizing the number of escapements per hour. He died in Teplice in Bohemia."

Boltwood attended Yale University, became a professor there and in 1910 was appointed chair of the first academic department of radiochemistry. He established that lead was the final decay product of uranium, noted that the lead-uranium ratio was greater in older rocks and, acting on a suggestion by Ernest Rutherford, was the first to measure the age of rocks by the decay of uranium to lead, in 1907. He got results of ages of 400 to 2200\u00a0million years, the first successful use of radioactive decay by Pb/U chemical dating. More recently, older mineral deposits have been dated to about 4.4\u00a0billion years old, close to the best estimate of the age of earth. His work with the uranium decay series led to the discovery of the parent of radium, a new element that he named ionium. Once the existence of isotopes was established, ionium was shown to in fact be thorium-230. Although Boltwood did not get his element on the periodic table, he later got a mineral namesake: Boltwoodite is named after him. In his later days, Boltwood suffered from depression and committed suicide on August 15, 1927."

He studied philology, especially Oriental, and philosophy at Altdorf from 1664 to 1669, in which year he went to Jena and became a disciple of the celebrated Johannes Mus\u00e4us, the representative of the middle party in the Syncretistic Controversy, whose daughter he married in 1674. Taking his doctor\u2019s degree the same year, in 1675 he became professor of church history at the university, and lectured with great success on several different branches of theology. In 1682 he was chosen to represent the Protestant side in the negotiations with the papal legate Nicolas Steno, bishop of Titiopolis, for reunion of the Churches. He was three times rector at Jena before he was called by the elector Frederick III, in 1694, as professor and provisional rector to the new university of Halle. Here his devotion to strict orthodoxy brought him into conflict with some of his colleagues, and the pietistic movement also gave him trouble, so that after a year he was glad to accept the combined positions of chief court preacher,  superintendent, and pastor at Weimar \u2014 which, however, he held only a few months until his death. He left a name in the history of theology, especially by his dogmatic compendium, which still preserves the early Protestant traditions among High Lutherans, especially in America. The Jena theologians, and Johannes Musaeus in particular, had been asked by Ernest the Pious to draw up such a work, to take the place of the antiquated Hutter, and Mus\u00e6us urged his son-in-law to do it. The first edition appeared in 1686, the second, enlarged, in 1691, and it has been frequently reprinted since. It was commended for general use as a textbook by its method, its conciseness, and its absence of mere polemics. It was obviously, however, intended by its author as a vindication of the Jena theology, which had been sharply attacked from Wittenberg, and lay under some suspicion of syncretism. Its dependence upon Mus\u00e6us is really the distinguishing feature of the book, which is largely a compilation from him. Baier\u2019s other works include polemical writings against Erbermann, a convert to Roman Catholicism and a Jesuit, and against the Quakers; and three other compendiums, published after his death (1698), one of exegetical, and one of moral theology, as well as one of the history of dogma. His read significance lies in the fact that he handed on and popularized the theology of Mus\u00e6us; and his work was continued by Buddeus, whom he left at Halle as professor of moral philosophy."

He is known for his measurements of the energy of black-body radiation which led Max Planck to the discovery of his radiation law. This was the genesis of quantum theory. After having attended realgymnasium  W\u00f6hlerschule in Frankfurt am Main, he started in 1884 to study electrical engineering at the technical universities in Darmstadt and Berlin. The following year he switched to physics at the University of Berlin which was more to his liking. After just one semester there he transferred to Strasbourg. There he benefited much from the lectures by August Kundt who in 1888 took over the vacant position of Hermann Helmholtz at the University of Berlin. Rubens followed after and got his doctors degree there the same year. In the period 1890\u20131896 he was employed as an assistant at the physics institute and made his habilitation in 1892. He was then a privatdozent and was allowed to teach. Already then he was praised for his experimental investigations of infrared radiation. Rubens got a permanent position in 1896 as docent at the Technical University of Berlin in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He could continue his experimental research at the nearby Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt. It was there he in 1900 did his important measurements of black-body radiation which made him world-famous. He was promoted to professor the same year. After Paul Drude retired in 1906 from his professorship at the University in Berlin, the position was given to Rubens. He was at the same time appointed director of the physics institute. In this way he could influence and lead a large group of colleagues and students. The year after he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences and became in 1908 a corresponding member G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He participated at the two first Solvay conferences after having received the Rumford Medal in 1910  \"on the ground of his researches on radiation, especially of long wave length.\". Heinrich Rubens died in 1922 after a longer illness. At a memorial meeting in the science academy the following year Max Planck said about him: He is buried at the Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg with his wife Marie. She took her life in 1941 for fear of being deported and killed by the Nazis. The burial place is near that of Gustav Kirchhoff, who founded spectroscopy and formulated the first laws of black-body radiation."

He was known as a scholar of William Shakespeare and many of his poems were Shakespearean sonnets. He was well-known and respected amongst the Transcendentalists, though he had a mental breakdown early in his career. Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became associated with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, then as a student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880."

Based for five decades at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Paulu was the author of five books and dozens of articles on radio and television in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe.  His work introduced American scholars and the interested public to broadcasting systems in Eastern and Western European countries where the role of the government and of advertising contrasted sharply with US practices. He taught and lectured widely in the US and Europe and held three appointments in the journalism department of Moscow State University, the first at a time when academic contacts between the US and the then - Soviet Union were rare and the last, when he was 81 years old, as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Paulu became manager of University of Minnesota radio station KUOM in 1928, in the early years of broadcasting, and participated in the development of public radio and television in the US, presiding as the University of Minnesota expanded its broadcasting activities to include short-lived innovations such as the use of closed circuit television to teach college courses and permanent changes to the American broadcasting landscape such as the introduction of educational television to the general public.  He taught classes on American and international broadcasting until he retired with the title of professor and director of the University's Media Resources Department in 1978. Born in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, and raised in small towns in South Dakota, Paulu developed an early interest in classical music as a result of hearing the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra perform when he was a boy.  His broadcasting career began in 1929, when he was working toward a degree in music at the University of Minnesota and took a part-time job as a student announcer at the university's young radio station WLB (later KUOM).  He earned a BA (1931) and BS (1932) in music along with an MA degree in history from the University of Minnesota.  While stationed in London and Luxembourg with the United States Office of War Information during World War II he developed an interest in European broadcasting, and in 1949 was awarded a PhD in communications from New York University. He was a frequent substitute trombonist for the Minnesota (formerly Minneapolis) Orchestra from the 1940s to the 1960s and contributed significantly to the Orchestra's oral history project through a series of taped interviews with performing artists. Among Paulu's numerous awards were five Fulbright Scholarships, three Ford Foundation grants, and a Sigma Delta Chi Award for journalism research.  He served as president of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and was a member of US delegations to UNESCO. Paulu was married for 60 years to the former Frances Tuttle Brown and was the father of three;  he died at age  92 of Parkinson's."

He was an outfielder over parts of nine seasons with the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Robertson was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. He attended North Carolina State University after matriculating at Maury High School and Norfolk Academy. In 1916 and 1917, he tied for the National League lead in home runs (with Cy Williams and Gavvy Cravath, respectively) while playing for New York. The short-distanced right field fence at the Polo Grounds was a frequent target of long drives hit by Robertson and his Giants' teammate, Benny Kauff. Their hits to right field became so much of an issue that  National League officials convened  following  the 1916 baseball season. Baseball officials decided to amend Rule #1, which read the shortest distance from a fence or stand on fair territory to the home base should be 235 feet. The amendment to the rule changed the shortest distance from a stand or fence to 270 feet. Robertson played for the Giants in the 1917 World Series against the Chicago White Sox, his 11 hits leading the team in the Series in a losing cause. A member of the Giants during the 1922 season, he did not make an appearance in the 1922 World Series. The champion Giants swept all four games of that Series from their crosstown rival New York Yankees. In a nine-year major-league career, Robertson posted a .287 batting average (812-2830) with 366 runs, 47 home runs and 364 RBI in 804 games played. His on-base percentage was .318 and slugging percentage was .409. He surpassed the .300 batting mark three times. On September 14, 1920, he went 5-5 as a member of the Cubs. On August 19, 1921, he had 8 RBI in a game as a member of the Pirates. Eleven days later, on August 30, he hit for the cycle. Robertson died at the age of 81 in Virginia Beach, Virginia."

Born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, he spent his youth in Seattle, Washington Territory and graduated from the University of Washington Territory in 1885. He taught botany and zoology in 1892 at the Washington Agricultural College (now Washington State University) in Pullman. He earned a master's degree in botany in 1900 from Harvard University. Piper compiled the first authoritative guides to flora in the northwestern United States. With his collaborator, R. Kent Beattie, he surveyed the Palouse area of southeastern Washington, and expanded the study to the entire state in 1906. That year, The Smithsonian Institution published his catalog Flora of the State of Washington. He also published Flora of Southeast Washington and Adjacent Idaho (1914) and Flora of the Northwest Coast (1915). These works established him as an authority on the plants of the northwestern U.S. In 1903, Piper began a career at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., which lasted until his death there. He worked on the domestication and introduction of grasses. On a trip to Africa, he found Sudan grass and introduced it to North America as a forage plant (vegetable matter eaten by livestock). Piper noted that much less study had been made of forage crops as compared to cotton, cereals, and other crops. He attributed this to the lack of economic incentive in studying forage plants. The soybean was another subject of Piper's studies. In 1923, he wrote, with William J. Morse, The Soybean, a thorough and now classic monograph of the species. The botanist was instrumental in establishing this plant as a successful crop in the U.S. It became a fundamental part of U.S. agriculture. Since the 1970s, it has been the second largest and most valuable crop in the United States after corn - and ahead of wheat. He was a founding member of the American Society of Agronomy in 1907 and served later as its president. Piper's knowledge of grasses led him to become Chairman of the United States Golf Association's Green Section from 1920 until his death. The orchid genus Piperia, containing eight species (e.g., Piperia yadonii), is named after him."

        "content": "Joseph Dillon Ford (born February 6, 1952 in Americus, Georgia, US, died March 8, 2017) was an American composer and author. He held undergraduate degrees in music and graduate degrees in both musicology and landscape architecture. Although he focused on keyboard performance during his college years, Ford completed his training at Harvard as a Variell Scholar specializing in historical musicology. He studied twentieth-century composers and compositional techniques with Ivan Tcherepnin, the works of Bach and Handel with Christoph Wolff, Dowland and the English lutenists with John Ward, and the music of medieval Aquitaine with David Hughes. His major works include three symphonies, a piano concerto, several harpsichord concertos and sonatas, choral music, and a large quantity of chamber and solo works for the piano and other instruments.  Although most of his oeuvre is tonal\u2014often very traditionally so, he also produced non-tonal work using both acoustic and electronic media, and developed synthetic chromatic dialects amenable to both idioms. Keenly interested in emergent music and telecommunications technologies and the rich potential they offer for international creative collaborations, he also conceived and brought to fruition numerous large-scale projects in which his interdisciplinary artistic background proved to be an especially useful asset.  These include the world's largest sound sculpture, an ongoing Web-based work that commemorates the monumental \"Standing Buddhas of Bamiyan\" demolished by the Taliban in 2001;  the \"Westron Wynde\" Project (begun in 2004), for which composers in the US, Canada, and the UK each contributed music for James J. Pellerite (former principal flutist of the Philadelphia Orchestra); the Delian Suites Nos. 1 through 5 (2005\u201309), each exploring various tonal idioms (No. 4 in cooperation with the Colloque Fou de Basson, Conservatoire Gabriel Faur\u00e9, Angoul\u00eame); Nu Mu [sic!] Unlimited (2006\u201309), the world's first virtual new music festival; and Ye New Music Fayre (2008\u201309), a seminal event featuring new music composed in traditional tonal and modal styles. Ford was the founder of the Delian Society, whose efforts to reinvigorate tonal music attracted many composers and performers on six continents and drew attention to the accomplishments of other outstanding artists. He resided in Gainesville, Florida until his death."

        "content": "Frederick Waldegrave Head MC & Bar (18 April 1874 \u2013 18 December 1941) was Anglican archbishop of Melbourne, Australia. Head was born in Tollington Park, London, the son of the Rev. Canon George Frederick Head and his wife Mary Henrietta, n\u00e9e Bolton. Educated at Alton School, Plymouth, Windlesham House School, near Brighton, Repton School, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Head graduated B.A. with first class honours in history in 1896, proceeded to M.A. in 1900, and received a B.D. degree in 1929. He was ordained deacon in 1902 and priest in 1903, was dean and tutor of Emmanuel College from 1903 to 1907, then senior tutor and chaplain of the college from 1907 to 1921. In 1915, he was interviewed for a commission as a Temporary Chaplain to the Forces. His lack of parochial experience counted against him, and he was thought to be \u2018slow in movement\u2019. After a second interview in January, 1916, he was appointed and posted to France. He could speak French and had already spent a year there working in a YMCA hut. He was attached to the Guards Division. \u2018Head was accepted from the start (by the Guards) ... Head, however, who might have been expected to be handicapped from the start as a Cambridge don, was an outstanding success. He was as successful with the officers in a lecture on Napoleon as he was with the men singing \u2018Tommy Tickler\u2019s Jar\u2019\u2019. By the time of his demobilisation in 1919, Head was Senior Chaplain to the Guards Division and the holder of a Military Cross and Bar. There is a citation for the Bar, \u2018For most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during operations lasting for several days, when he was continually in the front line accompanying an attack, and by his splendid example inspired the men on all occasions, whilst his attention to wounded and dying men were performed under continuous and heavy fire of all descriptions. His behaviour was the admiration of the whole division' In October, 1918, the Deputy Chaplain-General described him as \u2018First Rate ... in every way\u2019. His apparent \u2018slowness in movement\u2019 and lack of parochial experience did not, as was feared, handicap his excellent wartime service. He was vicar of Christ Church, East Greenwich from 1922 to 1926, chaplain to King George V from 1922 to 1929, and canon and sub-dean of Liverpool Cathedral from 1926 to 1929. Head was considered for bishoprics in England during the 1920s, particularly Peterborough in 1923, but he had not impressed Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury who wrote to the Prime Minister that Head \u2018was not in what I should regard as the first rank of men of power and leadership' In September 1929 he accepted the archbishopric of Melbourne, was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 1 November 1929, and enthroned in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 23 December 1929. In Melbourne, Head soon made himself acquainted with the various parishes and clergy. He found a diocese that already had many commitments in connexion with church schools and social work, and the financial depression which began just about the time of his arrival made a strong forward policy inopportune. He interested himself in the question of the re-union of the Christian churches, and in the holding together of his own diocese by preaching peace and goodwill to all, and setting a personal example of plain living and high thinking. At one period he voluntarily gave up a quarter of his stipend, and refused to countenance any expenditure which might lighten his own burden of work. If it was possible to help a parish by attending some function or service he made it his duty to be there, and his relations with his clergy were of the friendliest. From 1933 he was chaplain general to the Commonwealth military forces. Tactful, unassuming, and modest, scholarly and hard-working, much interested in social questions, Head was a steady influence for good in Melbourne. On 7 December 1941 he was driving his car to a confirmation service and ran into a post; he died from his injuries on 18 December 1941. His ashes are interred in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. He married in 1904 Edith Mary Colman, who survived him with one son. Head was the author of The Fallen Stuarts, published in 1901, and Six Great Anglicans, which appeared in 1929."

        "content": "Lyle Dean MacWilliam (born 31 July 1949) was a New Democratic member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 1993, representing the constituency of Okanagan-Shuswap. Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the son of John Michael MacWilliam and Doris Louise Coghill, MacWilliam studied at Simon Fraser University. In 1971, he married Arlene Leslie Sundvick. MacWilliam ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983. He was elected to represent Okanagan North in the assembly as a New Democratic Party member in a 1984 by-election held following the death of Donald James Campbell. At the time, MacWilliam's victory was considered a major upset as he was a 35-year old high school teacher facing off against Harold Thorlakson, a popular area rancher representing the governing Social Credit Party in a seat the party had held consistently since 1952. In the lead-up to the 1986 provincial election, MacWilliam became embroiled in an internal party debate over whether to force the resignation of then-leader Bob Skelly, with some in the party concerned about Skelly's popularity compared to that of the new Premier Bill Vander Zalm. MacWilliam spoke candidly about the party's internal discussions to the Canadian Press, commenting \"This is a very sensitive topic and I think I might be overstepping my limits on this.\" MacWilliam was defeated in his bid for reelection in the province's 1986 election. MacWilliam entered federal politics after winning the 1988 federal election at the Okanagan\u2014Shuswap electoral district for the New Democratic Party. During his tenure in parliament, MacWilliam earned a reputation as a rebellious partisan, often breaking with his caucus on votes. Notably, in 1992, MacWilliam was one of five NDP MPs who publicly broke with party leader Audrey McLaughlin over Bill C-81, which updated legislation surrounding referendums. The party's official position was that the bill needed firm spending caps for referendum sides, which MacWilliam disregarded in his vote. By the end of 1992, Vancouver Sun columnist Peter O'Neil gave MacWilliam a grade of \"C-\" on his performance, writing that the MP's \"judgment [was] in question.\" In his 1993 bid for re-election, MacWilliam lost to Darrel Stinson of the Reform Party. In 1997, MacWilliam announced he would be joining the Liberal Party and contest his former seat in the 1997 federal election. In an interview given to the Okanagan Saturday, MacWilliam indicated that he had grown disillusioned with the NDP not long after being elected to parliament, claiming he \"came very close to sitting as an independent.\" This was despite his position as the party's communications critic and decision to run again under the party's banner. MacWilliams also stated the Liberals were courting him during the 1993 election and critiqued the party's ideology and ties to organized labour. In the general election, he was again defeated by Stinson, placing second with only 175 fewer votes than he had received running as a New Democrat in 1993."

        "content": "Claudia Schreiber (born 1958 in Grebenstein, Hesse) is a German journalist and author. After studying journalism, education science and sociology at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and University of Mainz,  1979 \u2013 1985, M.A. degree, she worked as editor, reporter and anchorwoman for S\u00fcdwestfunk (SWF) and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), (children's newscast logo!, among others) broadcast networks. After stages in Moscow (1992 \u2013 1996) and Brussels (1996 \u2013 1998), she has been making her home in Cologne and is working as a freelance writer. In her novel Emmas Gl\u00fcck (Emma\u2019s Bliss) of 2003, translated into nine languages, she included motifs from her hometown in northern Hesse. It has been her most successful work so far. With its crisp and witty sentences, its deadpan presentation of the improbable and eccentric and its deep sympathy for its cast of misfits, Schreiber's style in this book somewhat recalls that of Heinrich B\u00f6ll. A film of this book, directed by Sven Taddicken and starring J\u00f6rdis Triebel and J\u00fcrgen Vogel was released in Germany in 2006; its English title is Emma's Bliss. Her children's book Sultan und Kotzbrocken (Sultan and Scumbag), first published in 2004, has so far been translated into four languages. It was produced as a theater play in the \u201cTheater Junge Generation\u201d in Dresden in an adaptation by R\u00fcdiger Pape (director) and J\u00f6rg H\u00fcckler (dramaturgy). The \u201cTheaterkumpanei Ludwigshafen\u201d has produced a bilingual version of the play in an adaptation by B\u00e4rbel Maier; they perform it in German and Persian, both in Germany and Iran, at the Fadjr Festival, among others. At the 17th Hamedan Theater Festival ForChirldren&Adults 2010 it won several prices. Schreiber's book Ihr st\u00e4ndiger Begleiter (Her Constant Companion, subtitle: Fast eine Liebesgeschichte - Almost a Love Story) also draws on her personal history: It is the story of a young woman growing up in a strict and narrow-minded Christian community, as Schreiber did. The novel recounts the heroine's struggle to liberate herself from her pervading relationship with God, who constantly appears to her and with whom she converses familiarly. A Dutch translation of this book appeared in 2007. Her latest novel S\u00fc\u00df wie Schattenmorellen (Sweet as Morello Cherries) is a coming-of-age-story, most of it taking place in a cherry orchard. While in Emma\u2019s Luck Schreiber's topic was the end of life, she writes here about its beginning. A film of this book will be produced by Makido Production/Wien und Weimar, directed by Manuel Siebenmann. Together with him Claudia Schreiber is writing the script and again adopting her own novel."

She was the first woman military surgeon in Russia, the first woman professor of surgery, and the first woman to serve as a physician in the Imperial Palace of Russia. Following her involvement in a student movement, Gedroits was unable to complete her studies in Russia, and despite being openly lesbian, entered into a marriage of convenience, which allowed her to obtain a passport in another name and leave the country. In Switzerland, she enrolled in the medical courses of C\u00e9sar Roux and graduated in 1898, working as Roux\u2019s assistant, but returned to Russia because of illnesses in her family. As a young physician, Gedroits was concerned at the low standards of hygiene, nutrition and sanitation, and made recommendations to improve conditions. In the Russo-Japanese War, she performed abdominal surgeries against established policy, leading to a change in the way battlefield medicine was performed. Much decorated for her war service, she served as physician to the royal court until the outbreak of World War I, training the Tsarina Alexandra and her daughters as nurses. At the beginning of the Revolution, Gedroits returned to the battle front. Wounded, she was evacuated to Kiev, where she resumed her work as a physician and academic. In 1921, she was hired to teach pediatric surgery at the Kiev Medical Institute and within two years was appointed a professor of medicine. Soviet purges at that time removed her from office in 1930 and denied her a pension. Gedroits turned her attention to writing autobiographical novels until her death from uterine cancer in 1932."

Born probably in Moray, he went to France in his youth, receiving a bachelorate in civil law from the University of Paris by 1396 and in canon law by 1407. His education was partly paid for by the prebend of Duffus and a grant from Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray, taken by Bur from the judicial profits of his diocese. During Innes' study period, he was also pursuing an ecclesiastical career, being Archdeacon of Caithness from 1396 until 1398, and Dean of Ross, from some point between 1396 and 1398 until 1407. He gave up the latter position in that year, having been elected as Bishop of Moray sometime in late 1406, and receiving consecration from Pope Benedict XIII in either Italy or southern France in the following January. Innes was bishop for over seven years, and died at Elgin on 2 August 1414. Innes has been traditionally credited with supervising much of the rebuilding to Elgin Cathedral. The historian David Ditchburn believes Innes was an ally, and possibly even a client, of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, and perhaps his father Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, the latter of whom was the warlord responsible for burning down Elgin Cathedral during the episcopate of Alexander Bur."

He served as Minister of State and President of the Central Bank under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In his youth, he was a member of the Christian Democratic Party. Kast was born to Michael Kast, a German lieutenant and Nazi who fled to Chile from Germany in 1950 after escaping American custody, and Olga Rist, whom his father had met in Bavaria while on the run. Upon getting his master's degree in economics at the University of Chicago, Kast joined Odeplan (1973), the state agency that led many public policy and economic changes after 1973. At Odeplan, Kast focused most of his energies on creating the \"map of extreme poverty\", which would become the cornerstone of Chile's social development programs. In 1978 he became the head of Odeplan and used his position to involve young professionals in the struggle against poverty by making them join Odeplan and by sending them to the country's outer regions to get insight into the real problems affecting Chile. In 1980, Kast became Labor Minister under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. In April 1982, aged 33, he became President of the Central Bank of Chile. This was a complicated moment in Chile's economy; the exchange rate was fixed at 39 pesos per dollar and Chile's large economic groups had liabilities with their own banks. As a central banker, he worked to reduce the level of related loans, which were loans made to the owners of the banks. He created a mechanism called the \"Portfolio Sale\" through which the Central Bank could buy high risk credits to commercial banks. By keeping a fixed exchange rate of 39 pesos per dollar, Kast hoped to protect local companies that had liabilities in dollars. However the central authority saw otherwise. On 13 June 1982, the peso was devalued, which created a loss of international reserves. Kast decided in August 1982 to completely free the exchange rate, further devaluing the peso and bringing new intervention from the central authority. Under this new threat of instability, Kast resigned from the Central Bank on 2 September. Kast left government life in late 1982 and dedicated himself to the business world and his professorship at Chile's Pontifical Catholic University. Around this time he began to feel unwell, developing signs of physical weakness and a pale appearance. In January 1983 he was diagnosed with bone cancer, which claimed his life on 18 September 1983. He was 34 years old."

He was a disciple of Ivan Minayev, the founder of Russian Indology. Sergey Feodorovitch Oldenburg was born in Russia on 26 September 1863, in Byankino, Transbaikal Oblast. His father was of the Livonian nobility; his grandfather was a full general in the Imperial Russian Army. During the 1880s while at St. Petersburg University Oldenburg participated in the Scientific-Literary Association of Students, a brotherhood which shared liberal and radical ideals. Here he met Aleksandr Ulyanov as they were both in the inner circle of this organisation. Ulyanov dropped out of the inner circle when he started to plan an assassination attempt on the life of emperor Alexander III. The attempt failed, and following the execution of Ulyanov in 1887, his brother, Vladimir Lenin visited Oldenburg in Saint Petersburg in 1891. Oldenburg had just returned from a two-year trip to London, Paris, and Cambridge. Oldenburg was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1900, and he served as its permanent Secretary from 1904 to 1929. From 1905 he became active in the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. In 1909\u201310 and 1914\u201315, he travelled in central Asia, where he discovered Sanskrit texts. He instigated scientific expeditions to Tibet and Dzungaria, which brought to light unique Buddhist manuscripts. To publish newly found manuscripts, in 1897 Oldenburg launched an authoritative edition of Buddhist texts, Bibliotheca Buddhica, which continues to this day. Oldenburg joined the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in 1905; he served as a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia from 1912 to 1917. Following the February Revolution of 1917 he served in the Russian Provisional Government as Minister of Education. He set up the Commission for the Study of the Tribal Composition of the Population of the Borderlands of Russia at this time. Unlike his Kadet colleagues, he stayed in Russia after the October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power. Based on his acquaintance with Vladimir Lenin, he was able to develop an alliance between the Bolsheviks and Russian ethnographers, the former being more interested in nationalism amongst European peoples of the former Russian Empire, the ethnographers focusing more on the national question amongst its Asian peoples. Although he was briefly imprisoned by the Cheka in 1919, Oldenburg served as permanent secretary of the Academy of Sciences until 1929, when the Communist Party ousted hundreds of staff for resisting Bolshevization. Oldenburg devoted the remainder of his life to administrating the Soviet Institute of Oriental Studies, whose antecedent (the Asian Museum) he had directed since 1916. He died on 28 February 1934 in St Petersburg. His granddaughter Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg became a well-known French novelist and historian."

Born in Belgrade, she was the only child of well-known theatre and television director Slavoljub Stefanovi\u0107-Ravassi and Desanka Nikoli\u0107. After finishing elementary school, Margita enrolled in the \"Josip Slavenski\" music high school from which she graduated as the most talented pianist in her class alongside Ivo Pogoreli\u0107. Her impressive school performance led to an offer of further studies at the famed Moscow Conservatory, which she ended up turning down due to family reasons\u2014her mother very much disliked the idea of letting her go to Moscow by herself at such a young age. Instead, Margita enrolled at the University of Belgrade's School of Architecture where she was no less successful. Throughout her architecture studies she still continued practicing the piano as well as playing and occasionally touring with various small orchestras. After graduating university in 1982, along with her then-boyfriend Sr\u0111an Vejvoda, she began to take an interest in Belgrade's underground music scene, which struck her as a completely different lifestyle from the one she was used to. During the spring of 1982 she was introduced to Milan Mladenovi\u0107 by her cousin Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107. Soon thereafter, at one of Katarina II's early rehearsals, she got an offer to join the band. After returning from a three-month trip to South America she decided to take the still-standing offer, joining Katarina II in late 1982. Margita was Katarina II/Ekatarina Velika's member until its very end in late 1994. During her time with the band she also collaborated on the albums of many other Yugoslav bands such as Karlowy Vary produced by Tomo in der M\u00fchlen, Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 & His Meteors, Van Gogh, Babe, etc. She composed the score for several TV films (\"Prvi put s ocem na jutrenje\", \"Vera Hofmanova\", \"Povratak Vuka Alimpi\u0107a\", \"Plavi plavi\") and theatre productions (\"Klasni neprijatelj\", \"Tri sestre\"). In 1985 she was introduced as an actress (the role of Dragana) in the movie \"Tajvanska kanasta\" (The Taiwan Canasta) directed by Goran Markovi\u0107. After Milan's death and Ekatarina Velika's end, Magi continued her work as a musician. During 1994/1995 she played in a band called Kurajberi, which gathered several Belgrade musicians and was focused mainly on performing covers at club gigs and jam sessions. In 1995, with a group of young Belgrade musicians involved in a techno movement, she formed a band called EQV and released an album Ti si sav moj bol (You are All of My Anguish) named after the famous Ekatarina Velika song, the album itself containing a techno version of the same song. The album was published by the Austrian label Coop Arts & Crafts Unlimited. In October of the same year, EQV participated in Tactic Festival in Vienna. She further continued contributing as a guest star on albums and concerts of many Serbian bands and occasionally played with bands Glisers, Zion banda and Direktori. Magi played keyboards in Belgrade's band \"The Glissers\" 1995. and 1996. They performed on a weekly basis and released a CD \"The Glissers Vol. 1\" for IMAGO Records. She also designed the cover for it. In 2019. it came out in vinyl form as an Album The Glissers for Yugovinyl and BIVECO. In 1996 she played several unplugged concerts with Elektri\u010dni orgazam, one of which was recorded and released the same year by B92 as \u017divo i akusti\u010dno (Live and Acoustic). During that time she was also involved in several significant music projects (\"S one strane duge\", \"Pesme iznad Istoka i Zapada\"). Sometime in 1996 Margita became a member of Ars Antibari writers society from Bar, which published several of her stories in two books (\"Izgleda da \u0107e Jugo\", Bar, 1996, and \"Da li da ti ka\u017eem ko te je ubio, Gea?\", Belgrade, 1999). In 2002 she composed the music for \"Kaput mrtvog \u010doveka\" (The Coat of a Dead Man) theater play directed by Hajdana Baleti\u0107, which turned out to be Magi's last music-related work. However, from 1996 onwards her life was mostly spent struggling with heroin addiction and the physical effects of long-term drug use. Following the passing of her father in February 1996, Margita's drug problems intensified. In order to support her habit, she sold pretty much all of her possessions including an apartment in downtown Belgrade. She used part of the money for a trip to India and also to buy two smaller apartments. Not long thereafter she sold those as well and eventually ended up living in a ramshackle modified garage in the suburb of Bor\u010da. By this time she was basically penniless, depending on charity and handouts for even the basics such as food. Margita Stefanovi\u0107 spent the last months of her life living in a homeless shelter in Vo\u017edovac. She was diagnosed to be HIV positive, which she contracted through intravenous drug use. She died on 18 September 2002 (aged 43) at the Belgrade Hospital for Infective Diseases where she had been sequestered since August of the same year."

Thoby Stephen was the eldest son of Leslie Stephen and Julia Prinsep Stephen. The result of his mother's second marriage, he was therefore a half-brother of George and Gerald Duckworth, her sons with first husband Herbert Duckworth. Stephen was educated at Clifton College, after failing to gain a place at Eton. However, this did not hold him back, since he won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, from Clifton. He was a friend of Lytton Strachey, who was enchanted by his masculinity and introduced him to the \"Reading Club\". He was described as \"over six feet tall and of somewhat ponderous build\". Stephen is credited with starting the Bloomsbury Group's Thursday evening gatherings. He was expected to distinguish himself, but he contracted typhoid at the age of 26 while on holiday in Greece, and died shortly after he was brought back to England. Vanessa Bell's eldest son, the poet Julian Bell, was named after him. He is the basis for the character of Tibby Schlegel in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel Howards End. Virginia Woolf's 1931 novel The Waves is considered by some critics to make significant reference to Thoby Stephen."

Hunter played baseball as a child, and helped lead his team to the Little League World Series in 1955. He graduated from Delaware Township High School in Delaware Township (now Cherry Hill), New Jersey, and played college football for the Syracuse Orange.

One of the youngest United States Attorneys in history, he was appointed to serve the Northern District of California, where he prosecuted high-profile federal defendants including members of Hells Angels and the Black Panther Party. Hunter was named the executive director of the NBPA in 1996. Hunter was criticized for employing many family members within the NBPA.  An external audit initiated by Derek Fisher uncovered numerous irregularities, and a select committee of NBA players unanimously ousted Hunter from his position on February 16, 2013, during the NBA All-Star break. In May 2013, Hunter sued the NBPA, Fisher and Jamie Wior\u2014Fisher's publicist and business partner\u2014seeking compensation and punitive damages. The suit claimed that Fisher had a secret deal with NBA owners during the 2011 NBA lockout. In January 2014, a judge dismissed all of Hunter's claims against Wior and Fisher, and Hunter dropped his subsequent appeal in May. However, the judge also ruled that it was the union's prerogative to fire Hunter, but allowed Hunter's claim that he was still owed $10.5 million to continue."

        "content": "Gregory Smith Prince Jr. (born 1939) became Hampshire College's fourth president in 1989 and retired in 2005. In his 15 years at the helm of Hampshire, Prince worked to broaden the public's awareness of the value and role of liberal arts education, reinforcing the understanding that the liberal arts are about developing an attitude of mind, not simply conveying a body of knowledge. Prince built partnerships with organizations outside of education and with K-12 education, stressing the importance of strong relationships between higher education institutions and their surrounding communities and the responsibility of higher education to society as a whole. As president, he envisioned a \"Cultural Village,\" a cluster of independent organizations with complementary missions located around the campus.  The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, a center for international picture book art, drew 90,000 visitors to the Hampshire campus and Amherst during its first year. The National Yiddish Book Center, shares the treasures of rescued Yiddish Books, representing a thousand years of Jewish history and culture. Lastly, New England Wetlands, Inc., grows 118 species of plants for use in restoration of wetlands throughout the region. Prince has served as president of Five Colleges, Inc. and as chairman of the board of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM). He is chairman of The Washington Campus, vice-chair of the Council on Racial and Ethnic Justice of the American Bar Association and serves on the board of directors of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), the Massachusetts Nature Conservancy and the Joyful Child Foundation. Prince is also the 2004 recipient of the Millicent Kauffman Award from the Amherst Area Chamber of Commerce, the town's equivalent of the citizen of the year. Prince is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of the American University in Bulgaria and a member of the Governing Board of the European Humanities University. In 2008 he authored a book, Teach Them to Challenge Authority, in which he argues that \"educational institutions should model the behaviour and values they seek to instil in their students and how this is essential to teaching students how to challenge authority and convention in appropriate, creative and constructive ways.\" Prince earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies, a Masters in philosophy and a Ph.D. in American studies from Yale University. Before joining Hampshire, he was associate dean of the faculty for curriculum planning and resource development at Dartmouth College and a professor of history."

Witwer sponsored legislation to improve public access to hiking trails by extending legal liability protection to landowners who allow public access to their land.  Along with State Senator Josh Penry, he has pushed for legislation to raise graduation standards for Colorado high school students, especially in the areas of math and science. He has also been outspoken against legislative efforts to freeze mill levies on Colorado property owners, arguing that this policy amounts to a property tax increase. The Rocky Mountain News has called Witwer, Josh Penry, Cory Gardner and Matt Knoedler the \"Rock Stars\" of the Colorado GOP, and National Journal named him one of its \"stars to watch in the future\". Witwer announced that he would not seek re-election in 2008. Witwer served as Campaign Manager for his successor, Representative Cheri Gerou. Witwer says he is likely to return to public service after he has more time to spare from raising his four young sons.

        "title": "John Sutherland (physician)_Summary",
        "content": "John Sutherland (December 1808 \u2013 14 July 1891) was a physician and promoter of sanitary science. Sutherland was born in Edinburgh, where he completed his high school studies. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1827, and graduated M.D. at the university in 1831. He was married to Sarah Elizabeth Cowie (1808\u201395), daughter of a Lancashire merchant. There were no children. Mrs Sutherland became a friend of Florence Nightingale, and assisted her with practical matters, when he became Nightingale's closest collaborator. Mrs Sutherland shared their concerns about public health; she was an active member of the Ladies' Sanitary Association. After spending much time on the continent he practised for a short period in Liverpool, where he edited 'The Liverpool Health of Towns' Advocate' in 1846. In 1848, at the request of the Earl of Carlisle, he entered the public service as an inspector under the first board of health. He conducted several special inquiries, notably one into the cholera epidemic of 1848\u20139 (Parl. Papers, 1850 No. 1273, 1852 No. 1523). He was the head of a commission sent to foreign countries to inquire into the law and practice of burial. In 1851, Sutherland was appointed as the British medical delegate to the first International Sanitary Conference (aka Cholera Conference or Quarantine Conference). Louis Napoleon conferred him the Order of the Legion of Honour for services in producing a new International Sanitary Regulation. In 1855 he was engaged at the Home Office in bringing into operation the act for abolishing intramural interments (ib. 1856, No. 146). He was also doing duty in the reorganised general board of health when, at the request of Lord Palmerston and Lord Panmure, he became the head of the Sanitary Commission sent to the Crimean War to deal with the massive sanitary defects of the war hospitals. This commission's mandate was not only to investigate but to implement changes. It started work in March 1855 on the worst Scutari hospitals and succeeded in bringing down the death rates. With Sutherland was a leading civil engineer, Robert Rawlinson, and members of the pioneering Sanitary Department at Liverpool, who did the cleaning out of the sewers and drains. On 25 August 1855 he came to England for consultation, and was summoned to Balmoral to inform the Queen of the steps that had been taken for the benefit of the troops. After the war he and Nightingale, with many others, tried to get the planned Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley cancelled (it was drastically redesigned). He and Nightingale jointly produced a confidential report on it for the war secretary. He took an active part in the preparation of the report of the royal commission on the health of the army dated 1858 (ib. 1857\u201358, No. 2318), and also of the report on the state of the army in India, dated 19 May 1863 (ib. 1863, No. 3184). Both reports were of vast importance to the welfare of the soldiers, and most of Sutherland's recommendations were carried out. One of these was the appointment of the barrack and hospital improvement commission, with Sidney Herbert as president and Captain (afterwards Sir) Douglas Galton, Dr. Burrell of the army medical department, and Sutherland as members. This committee visited every barrack and hospital in the United Kingdom, and the sanitary arrangements of each were reported on. Defects were brought to light and remedied, and the health of the troops consequently improved (ib. 1861, No. 2839). Subsequently, Dr. Sutherland and Captain Galton visited and made reports on the Mediterranean stations, including the Ionian Islands (ib. 1863, No. 3207). As a member of the Royal Commission on the Crimean War, Sutherland worked up the considerable amount of evidence for it. He also gave his own evidence to it. He then became the \"active member\" of the four sub-commissions set up within the War Office, after the Crimean War, to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission were implemented. Further, again according to Nightingale, not only was he a member of the Royal Commission on India, he \"wrote nearly the whole\" of the report on it. That work benefited as well as the British Army, \"the whole native population\u2014all that has been done for them sprang from this commission\". In 1862 the barrack and hospital improvement commission was reconstituted with the quartermaster-general as president and Sutherland as a prominent member. The title was altered to the army sanitary committee in 1865 (ib. 1865, No. 424). Two Indian officers were added, and all sanitary reports were submitted to the committee and suggestions for improving Indian stations prepared. This arrangement remained in force until Sutherland's retirement on 30 June 1888, when he was appointed a medical superintending inspector-general of the board of health and home office. Nightingale considered that Dr Sutherland received so little recognition for his work: no honours from the UK, although the French gave him the Legion of Honour. Nightingale and Sutherland formed an effective public health reform team. They shared a common philosophy, of the application of the best available science, to be applied to the problem at hand, then ongoing monitoring to ensure that the results were beneficial. Sutherland acted sometimes as Nightingale\u2019s research assistant, finding crucial material for her\u2014he was a doctor and well connected internationally with public health and military experts. Sometimes he was her secretary, reading correspondence and drafting replies for her. They shared a Christian faith and ambitious, faith-based, goals for reform. Sutherland drafted some of Nightingale\u2019s boldest statements about quality hospital care being available to the poorest\u2014as good as that received by private patients. Sutherland continued his beneficent work to within a few years of his death, which took place at Oakleigh, Alleyne Park, Norwood, Surrey, on 14 July 1891. Sutherland\u2019s last words to his wife were for Nightingale: \u201cGive her my love and my blessing\u201d. Nightingale insisted that a full obituary to her friend and collaborator appeared in The Times. Sutherland was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. Eight volumes of notes and correspondence between Sutherland and Nightingale are at the British Library."

A graduate of Harvard University, Birch began working on geophysics as a research assistant. He subsequently spent his entire career at Harvard working in the field, becoming an Associate Professor of Geology in 1943, a professor in 1946, and Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology in 1949, and professor emeritus in 1974. Birch published over 100 papers. He developed what is now known as the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state in 1947. In 1952 he demonstrated that Earth's mantle is chiefly composed of silicate minerals, with an inner and outer core of molten iron. In two 1961  papers on compressional wave velocities, he established  what is now called Birch's law."

He also played in college for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1963 to 1966. At Michigan, Clancy started as a quarterback, switched to halfback, returned punts and kickoffs, and became a star as an end.  In two seasons as an end (1965\u20131966), Clancy rewrote the Michigan receiving record book.  At the time of his graduation, he held the school records for most receptions and receiving yards in a career, season and game.  His 1966 total of 197 receiving yards against Oregon State remained Michigan's single-game receiving record until November 6, 2010.  He was named an All-American and also set the Big Ten Conference record for most receptions in a single season of conference play.  Though most of his records have since been broken, Clancy continues to rank among the leading receivers in Michigan history. Clancy was drafted by the Miami Dolphins of the American Football League (AFL).  In 1967, quarterback Bob Griese and Clancy were both rookies for the Dolphins. Clancy caught 67 passes that year, setting an AFL rookie record.  He was third in the AFL in receptions in 1967 and eighth in receiving yards.  He was named to the 1967 AFL All-star game.  After a sensational rookie season, Clancy suffered a serious knee injury in a 1968 exhibition game and missed the entire season.  While making a comeback in 1969, Clancy suffered an injury to his other knee.  Traded to the Green Bay Packers in 1970, Clancy was unable to return to his prior form after the knee injuries.  He made only 16 receptions in 14 games and was released by the Packers before the start of the 1971 season."

In high school, Hoey was an All-State halfback.  At the University of Michigan,  College Football Hall of Fame halfback Ron Johnson was in Hoey's class, and Hoey was therefore used principally as a defensive back.  Hoey is most remembered for his work as a punt returner at Michigan.  He led the Big Ten Conference in punt return yards in 1967 and 1968, and still holds Michigan's modern era (post-1949) records for most punt return yards in a game (140), most return yards per punt in a season (24.3) and most return yards per punt in a career (17.1).  Hoey was also a record-setting sprinter on Michigan's track and field team. In five seasons in the NFL, Hoey was principally a kickoff returner.  In 1971, he set a St. Louis Cardinals club record with six kickoff returns for 206 yards, including one for 103 yards and a touchdown. He had 534 kickoff return yards in his career. Since 1993, Hoey has worked in administration at the University of Colorado. He worked first in academic services for the athletic department.  After controversies in the late 1990s concerning eligibility of University of Colorado athletes, Hoey accepted a position in the school's career services department providing career counseling to student athletes."

        "content": "Lucretia Blow Le Bourgeois Van Horn (1882\u20131970) was a noted American artist.  When she was eighteen, she enrolled in the Art Students League of New York where she took classes from John Twachtman and George Bridgman.  She then traveled to Paris in 1902 to continue her studies at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian where she was the first woman to be awarded the Concours Julian-Smith in 1904. On her return to the United States, she began to earn commissions mainly for her meticulous illustrations in magazines and books, like those she drew for Helen Hay Whitney's book of poems, entitled Herbs and Apples (1910). In San Antonio, Texas, she helped form the San Antonio Conversation Society in 1924.  In 1926 she met Diego Rivera. As Rivera was finishing his mural project at the Ministry of Education in Mexico City, Mrs. Van Horn joined him and other artists in the production of the work.  Rivera painted her face in one of the murals on the third floor of the building. For four years (1928\u201332), she and her husband lived in Berkeley, California where she joined various art leagues and worked with prominent artists in the Bay Area, including John Emmett Gerrity, David Park and Galka Scheyer who represented The Blue Four:  European abstractionists, Feininger, Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Klee.  She also became a member of the San Francisco Art Association and the Society of Women Artist, won several notable awards, and was included in a major international retrospective at the Legion of Honor in San Francisco as one of thirty-five American artists. During a trip to Mexico is 1926, Van Horn met and befriended Diego Rivera. He was working on a mural for the Ministry of Education in Mexico city at the time. During her time in Mexico, Van Horn was greatly influenced by Rivera which led to a major transformation in her work. Her subject matter became mostly native peasant women, pictured in an outside setting and much more simplified than her earlier works. She returned to Berkeley in 1941 after her husband died.  She contacted an old Berkeley colleague, Marjorie Eaton who lived in Palo Alto on the Juana Briones Ranch, owned by Ms. Eaton's mother.  There she spent the last twenty-eight years of her life. Mrs. Van Horn's life was peripatetic and at times difficult.  Her mother died when she was three, and shortly after moved from her family's sugar plantation on the Mississippi River to New Orleans.  When she fourteen, she went to live in Washington, D.C. with her socially and politically involved aunt and uncle, Martha and Herbert Wadsworth. In Washington she met Douglas MacArthur, who fell in love with her, as evidenced by a recently discovered cache of letters written to her by him. Around the same time she met her husband Robert Osborn Van Horn; they were married in 1908.  Van Horn was also a military officer who subsequently served under MacArthur during the First World War and retired as a brigadier general in 1940. During her married years, Mrs. Van Horn lived in many places: Cuba, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, and California.  She and her husband had two daughters: Margaret born in 1909 and Lucretia in 1916.  When Margaret contracted tuberculosis and died in 1932, Mrs. Van Horn, devastated by the loss, left her family for some time.  It is not clear where she went or for how long. Mrs. Van Horn's artistic evolution went through at least three distinctive phases.  Her early illustrations reflect her attraction to the work of Maxfield Parrish, her work of the late 1920s and 1930s are patterned on the images of Diego Rivera, and her later work was influenced by the European abstractionists, most especially her favorite, Paul Klee."

Still\u00e9 was one of the first in America to distinguish between typhus and typhoid fever. His observations in this connection he made during a typhus epidemic in Philadelphia in 1836 and reported in 1838.  He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1852. He acquired a great reputation as a practitioner, teacher, and writer, and was the first secretary, and in 1871\u201372 the president, of the American Medical Association.

        "content": "Clinton DeWitt Boyd (September 26, 1884 \u2013 September 1950) was a Middletown, Ohio attorney, Common Pleas judge and politician and was one of four founders of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity as an undergraduate at Miami University. Boyd was born and raised in Mount Orab, Ohio. He came to Oxford, Ohio in September 1903 as a third-year preparatory student in the Miami Academy. He began his college work in 1904. At Miami, Boyd was both an athlete and one of the most silver-tongued of Miami's orators. He was a distance runner, representing the varsity track team in the mile and 880-yard events. He captained the team in his senior year and acquired the nickname \"Teeny\" because of his slight runner's build, and he was active on the intramural track and basketball teams. Boyd was a four-year member of the Miami Union Literary Society and was elected vice-president. His speech, \"Emancipation of a Backward Race,\" won him the gold medal in the university's oratorical contest in 1907. After Miami, Boyd enrolled in the University of Cincinnati's law school, and then transferred to the University of Michigan, where he earned his law degree in 1910. He opened a law office in Middletown, Ohio. Boyd was a persistent politician and a successful county judge who ran several times for statewide office in Ohio without success. He was defeated in the Republican primary of 1924 for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and was defeated in the 1926, 1928 and 1944 Republican primaries for Ohio Attorney General. He was appointed to the common pleas bench of Butler County, Ohio in 1929 and was twice reelected to that position, retiring in 1937. He was defeated in the Republican primary for Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1938 and 1950 and was defeated in the general elections for judge of the Ohio Supreme Court in 1940 and 1946 and in the Republican primary in 1948. Boyd remained actively interested in the Phi Kappa Tau throughout his life. He was the first person elected to the position of national organizer at the fraternity's Danville, Kentucky, convention of 1915; and worked aggressively to extend the fraternity to Northwestern, Wabash, Purdue, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Carnegie Tech. He was a frequent speaker at Founders' Day gatherings at Miami and around the country. In the final year of his life, he visited several chapters and alumni on the West Coast. Boyd helped to initiate his son, Clinton Dewitt, Jr., into Phi Kappa Tau at Miami University in 1948; and Boyd's grandson, Mark, is also a member. Boyd was killed in an automobile accident in September 1950 when the car he was driving skidded on a slick road en route to the Ohio Republican Convention. He was interred at Woodside Cemetery, Middletown, Ohio."

Nicknamed \"Ober\", he was born and raised in Davenport, Iowa, but he lived most of his adult life in Minnesota.  Oberholtzer attended Harvard University and received a bachelor of arts degree, but left after one year of graduate study in landscape architecture.  He made his first trip to the Minnesota-Ontario border lakes in 1906. In 1909 he took his first extended canoe voyage through the border lakes and the Rainy Lake watershed, traveling 3,000 miles that summer.  During the period from 1908 to 1915, Oberholtzer wrote a number of articles and short stories, some under the penname Ernest Carliowa.  Many of the stories and articles were based on his canoe trip experiences.  In 1913, Oberholtzer moved to Rainy Lake.  He purchased Mallard Island in 1922; the tiny island would be his home for more than 50 years. After plans were announced by business mogul Edward Backus to construct a series of dams to harness the Rainy Lake watershed for power generation, Oberholtzer spoke in opposition at a hearing of the International Joint Commission held at International Falls in September 1925.  As a result of meetings with Minneapolis businessmen who were similarly opposed to industrialization of the area, the Quetico-Superior Council was formed in 1928.  Oberholtzer served as its first president.  His activities for the council included lobbying United States Congress and the Minnesota legislature, testifying before the International Joint Commission and building public support for the council's program.  In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the President's Quetico-Superior Committee to advise and coordinate government activity concerning the Quetico-Superior area. Oberholtzer was its first chairman, and served as a member until 1968. Oberholtzer was one of the eight founding members of The Wilderness Society and served on its executive council from 1937 until 1967.  His addition to The Wilderness Society lent national stature to the group.  In addition to his wilderness campaigning, he spoke fluent Ojibwe and was a fervent student of their culture.  He never married and died in 1977 after a long period of ill health. Oberholtzer is recognized today as a leading advocate for the preservation of the Quetico-Superior lake area, as well as an advocate of the Native American culture in that region.  The Minneapolis Star Tribune selected Oberholtzer as one of the 100 Most Influential Minnesotans of the 20th century."

        "content": "Major James Archibald Morrison DSO (18 September 1873 \u2013 27 October 1934) was a British Conservative Party politician. Morrison was the son of Alfred Morrison, of Fonthill House, and the grandson of James Morrison. Hugh Morrison was his elder brother and Lord Margadale his nephew. A rower and expert shot, Morrison became a second lieutenant in the 4th (Eton Volunteer) Battalion, Oxfordshire Light Infantry on 12 December 1891, and transferred to the 4th Middlesex Volunteer Rifle Corps on 15 May 1895. He transferred to the Grenadier Guards on 5 February 1895, and subsequently fought in the Second Boer War. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Wilton division of Wiltshire at an unopposed by-election in July 1900. He was re-elected at the 1900 general election, but at the 1906 election he lost his seat to the Liberal Party candidate. In 1910, he inherited Basildon Park from his uncle Charles (son of James Morrison), and was elected  MP for Nottingham East. He resigned the seat in 1912 by the procedural device of accepting the post of Steward of the Manor of Northstead. In 1912 he was named as the co-respondent in a divorce case between Helena Woodley Morand and her husband, the actor M. R. Morand. Both Helena Morand and Morrison denied adultery but the case was found proved and M. R. Morand was awarded \u00a35,500 in agreed damages against Captain Morrison. Morrison made major improvements to the Basildon estate, building new cottages and pumping stations to supply it with water. When the First World War broke out, he returned to the Grenadier Guards. Harold Macmillan served as a lieutenant under his command. Badly wounded at the Battle of the Somme, he was invalided out of the Army and turned over Basildon Park for use as a Guards' convalescent home. He was awarded the DSO in 1916. Morrison sold off the Basildon estate to Sir Edward Iliffe in 1929 and died in 1934."

Educated at Columbia University (where he restricted himself to Russian, German, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit and Polish), Urdang was a linguistics lecturer at New York University from 1956 to 1961.  Although he never wrote the dissertation that would have completed his graduate degree, the Random House Dictionary filled the void amply: \"He always said he considered the Random House dictionary his dissertation,\" said Nicole Urdang. Urdang made his debut in the publishing industry as an associate editor in the dictionary department at Funk & Wagnalls and developed a vast vocabulary.  Not averse to making fun of his profession, he wrote in the introduction to Misunderstood, Misused, & Mispronounced Words: This is not a succedaneum for satisfying the nympholepsy of nullifidians. Rather it is hoped that the haecceity of this enchiridion of arcane and recondite sesquipedalian items will appeal to the oniomania of an eximious Gemeinschaft whose legerity and sophrosyne, whose Sprachgef\u00fchl and orexis will find more than fugacious fulfillment among its felicific pages.

Miner earned a bachelor's degree from Smith College in 1958, a law degree from Columbia Law School in 1961 and a degree in urban planning from Columbia University in 1972. She married James Edward O'Driscoll, a lecturer in the American language program at Columbia on June 25, 1970; The marriage lasted until his death in 1993. In 1973, Miner was named as counsel to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Her work helped create the legal process for the 1983 landmark status designation of the 17th-century street plan of Lower Manhattan as part of a historic district. This plan helped prevent developers from restructuring the irregular blocks in the area's grid structure. Miner played a major role in presenting the city's case in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978), in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld (by a 6-3 margin) the ability of New York City to restrict development of Grand Central Terminal based on the building's landmark designation. The Penn Central company had argued that the development restrictions placed on the site constituted an unconstitutional taking of its property by the government in conflict with the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In 1994, new Landmarks Preservation Commission chair Jennifer Raab announced that Miner would be leaving as chief counsel at the end of October 1998, citing the need for a \"fresh eye\". Raab acknowledged Miner's \"very large and important role\" and affirmed that  it was Miner \"who helped establish the legal right to designate landmarks.\" After leaving the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miner accepted a position at Pace University School of Law and as an adjunct associate professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. She lived in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, and died at age 72 of complications of lung disease."

He and his twin brother, Robert H. Hume, became famous in 1944 and 1945 as the \u201cdead heat twins\u201d due to their practice of finishing their races hand-in-hand in an intentional effort to finish each race tied for the win.  During the 1944 track season, the Hume twins tied for the win in nine straight mile races, including the Big Ten Conference and NCAA championships.  They were co-winners in every mile event they entered in 1944 except one.  The exception occurred at a dual meet in which \"a meticulous official ruled that one of the Humes beat the other across the finish line by a couple of inches although they were hand in hand at the wire.\"  Their best time in a \u201cdead heat\u201d mile with hands clasped was 4:14.6 at the Central Collegiate Conference meet in 1944; the time broke a school record of 4:16.4 that had been set by H.L. Carroll 28 years earlier in 1916. The Hume twins were raised in Canonsburg, a small town in Pennsylvania\u2019s soft coal region, not far from Pittsburgh.  Robert Hume set the school record for the mile, and Ross set the record in the half mile.   After graduating from Canonsburg High School, the Hume twins enrolled at the University of Michigan to run track under Coach Ken Doherty.  One sports columnist in 1945 noted that the Humes were \u201ctwins in every possible manner, facial resemblance, running style, the clothes they wear, and the courses they are taking.\u201d In his track career at Michigan, Ross Hume won three NCAA championships and six Big Ten Conference championships.  He won the 1944 NCAA outdoor mile run in a dead heat with his brother.  And in 1945, he won NCAA individual championships in both the outdoor mile run and the outdoor 880-yard run.  He won six Big Ten championships from 1943-1946.  His  Big Ten championships included the indoor and outdoor mile runs in 1944 and 1945, all four of which were shared \u201cdead heat\u201d wins with his brother.  He also won Big Ten championships in the two-mile run in the 1944 outdoor and 1945 indoor conference championship meets.   Ross was named an NCAA All-American three times and was selected as the captain of Michigan\u2019s track team in 1945. The Hume twins\u2019 practice of interlocking hands in \u201cdead heat\u201d wins drew national publicity and also controversy.  Associated Press columnist Jimmy Jordan dubbed them the \u201cdead heat twins.\u201d  Another writer referred to them as the \u201cDead Heat Kids.\u201d  The publicity peaked in June 1944 when \u201cMichigan's famous distance running twins raced to their ninth straight dead-heat victory in the mile run of the 23rd National Collegiate Athletic Association track and field championship meet tonight, finishing hand-in-hand more than 100 yards ahead of the next runner.\u201d  A columnist in Massachusetts wrote: \u201dAs the twins finished their sophomore year at Michigan, [Coach Ken] Doherty decided to run them in the mile and two mile races together \u2026 this proved to be a happy solution \u2026 the twins like to run together .. they\u2019ve been doing that since before their school days .. furthermore, they usually finish so far in front that the last 50 yards finds that they are clasping hands and hit the tape together.\u201d United Press columnist Bob Meyer noted that they \u201cdeliberately have finished in a dead heat for first place in every mile except one in which both were entered this year,\u201d and suggested that the twins \u201cpossibly may forget their sentimental trick of locking hands for a dead-heat finish in order to defeat a tough field and slice another second or 2 off their CCC time.\u201d As a result of the Humes\u2019 practice, the NCAA passed a rule in 1946 stating that athletes would no longer be able to tie in any track meets. After graduating from Michigan, Ross Hume became an orthopedic surgeon.  His brother Robert became a general surgeon.  The brothers were inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1990.  Robert died in 1999, and Ross followed in 2000."

Partners in the Wall Street law firm of Eveleth & Bissell, the two formed the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company with 5 other investors from New York, New Haven, and Titusville, Pennsylvania, to \"raise, procure, manufacture, and sell Rock Oil.\" Eveleth was born in New Gloucester, Maine, on May 8, 1821, to James and Hannah Austin Eveleth.  His father was a leather tanner and boot and shoe maker and a descendant of early colonial families of Massachusetts. He was a direct descendant of Joseph Eveleth, juror in the Salem Witch trial of John Proctor, and a second cousin of Theophilus Parsons, Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Eveleth married Mary Weeks of Bath, Maine, in 1852. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1847 and Harvard Law School in 1854.  He was Principal of the Liberal Institute (1848\u20131849) a college preparatory school in Norway, Maine, and then, following law school, joined Fessenden & Deblois, the Portland, Maine law firm of U.S. Representative Thomas Fessenden's family.  He later formed his own firm with Bissell in New York at 14 Wall St. His New York practice was eventually closed in 1859 to allow the partners to fully pursue their oil business venture. Bissell and Eveleth initially invested $5,000 to purchase and lease over  of what they believed were the principal oil fields in Titusville, PA.  The company collected oil in trenches and sold small quantities at high prices ($1.50 per gallon) primarily for medicinal purposes. Believing in the mineral's greater economic potential and in order to gain the interest of additional investors, the two partners engaged at their own expense renowned Yale chemist, Benjamin Silliman, Jr., to investigate crude oil samples from the Pennsylvania site for its properties and commercial usefulness.  Silliman submitted in 1855 his historic report to \"Messrs. Eveleth, Bissell, and Reed\" concluding, \"gentlemen ... there is much ground for encouragement in the belief that your Company have in their possession a raw material from which they may manufacture... very valuable products\", thus marking a major scientific milestone for the university as well the birth of the American petroleum industry.  The company was then reorganized to include additional New Haven investors, and Silliman was appointed president, with Eveleth and Bissell maintaining controlling interest. Pennsylvania Rock Oil later leased its property to Seneca Oil, which under the management of Edwin Drake, drilled the first oil well in the United States and became the first to strike oil in 1859.  Bissell continued to considerably expand his and the New York investors' land in the Titusville region, in Franklin and Petroleum Center, PA. However, Eveleth's life was cut short only 2 years later due to illness.   Bissell went on to become known as \"the father of the American oil industry\". Eveleth was described as \"sage, cautious, and tenacious\" and the \"principal promoter\" of the company who made many of the major decisions. He died in New York City on December 10, 1861, after suffering from nephritis. His son and only child, Charles W. Eveleth, died in Germany while a student at Ober Gymnasium."

        "content": "Sir Thomas Clarke  (1703 \u2013 13 November 1764) was a British judge who served as Master of the Rolls. He was the son of a carpenter and a pawnbroker from St Giles in the Fields, and was educated at Westminster School between 1715 and 1721 thanks to the help of Zachary Pearce. On 10 June 1721 he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1724. He became a fellow of Trinity College in 1727, and a member of Gray's Inn the same year. Clarke was evidently knowledgeable in Roman law, and was mentioned in a poem called the causidicade as a possible Solicitor General in 1742. He became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1740, and in 1742 left Gray's Inn to join Lincoln's Inn, which he became a bencher of in 1754. In 1747 he was elected a Member of Parliament for St Michael's, and in 1754 was returned for Lostwithiel. After the death of the Master of the Rolls, Sir John Strange, Clarke was offered the position. The job was originally offered to William Murray, later Lord Mansfield, but he turned it down. If he had accepted, Clarke might instead have succeeded Murray as Attorney General for England and Wales. Clarke was officially appointed on 25 May 1754, and was knighted at the same time. In June 1754 he was invested as a Privy Councillor (PC). Clarke evidently discharged his duties \"with great credit\" for ten years, until his death in office on 13 November 1764. He was buried in the Rolls Chapel, now the main library of King's College London. Clarke was a close friend of the Earl of Macclesfield, and this friendship combined with his unclear parentage started rumours that Clark was in fact Macclesfield's son. In his will, Clarke left his Flitcroft-designed home, Branch Hill Lodge, to Macclesfield. Outside politics and law, Clarke was a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), and \"devoted himself to philosophical pursuits\"."

Brumfield is currently Professor of Slavic studies at Tulane University. Brumfield grew up in the deep American South, where he became interested in Russia by reading Russian novels. After receiving a BA from Tulane University in 1966 and an MA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968, he arrived in the former Soviet Union for the first time in 1970 as a graduate student starting work in architectural photography, although he did not seriously study the craft of photography until 1974. Brumfield earned a Ph.D in Slavic studies at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973 and held a position of assistant professor at Harvard University in 1974\u20131980. In 1983 Brumfield, formerly a generalist of Slavic studies, established himself in the history of architecture with his first book, Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture. It was followed by The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture (1991), Russian housing in the modern age: design and social history (1993), A History of Russian Architecture (1993, Notable Book of that year and a best seller according to The New York Times), Lost Russia: Photographing the Ruins of Russian Architecture (1995), Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey (1997) and Commerce in Russian urban culture: 1861-1914 (English edition 2001, Russian edition 2000). In 1986 Brumfield organized the first exhibit of photographic prints from the Prokudin-Gorsky Collection at the Library of Congress. Since that time Brumfield has been actively engaged in the study of Prokudin-Gorsky's photographs, including several publications for the site \"Russia Beyond the Headlines\". Brumfield lived in the former Soviet Union and Russia for a total of fifteen years, doing postgraduate research with Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg State University, but mostly travelling through the northern country, surveying and photographing the surviving relics of vernacular architecture. In a 2005 interview Brumfield, asked to tell which of those journeys stood out, picked a photo survey of Varzuga, a remote village connected to civilization by 150 kilometers of a sandy clay track. Brumfield donated his collection of around 1,100 photographs of Northern Russian architecture taken in 1999\u20132003 to the Library of Congress. His archives were digitized with assistance of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Washington Library. The basic collection of Brumfield's photographic work is held in the Department of Images Collections at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. The William C. Brumfield Collection consists of 12,500 black-and-white 8\" x 10\" photographic prints, 40,000  negatives and over 89,000 digital files, most of which are in color (nearly 149,000 in total). In 2000 Brumfield was elected a Guggenheim Fellow for Humanities - Russian History. He has been a full member of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences (RAASN) since 2002 and an honorary fellow of the Russian Academy of the Arts since 2006. He currently holds the record for most domes captured in a single photograph. In 2014 the D. S. Likhachev Foundation in St. Petersburg awarded Brumfield the D. S. Likhachev Prize \"for outstanding contributions to the preservation of the historic and cultural heritage of Russia.\" In 2019 Brumfield was awarded the Order of Friendship, \u201cfor the merits in strengthening friendship and cooperation between peoples, fruitful activities for the rapprochement and mutual enrichment of cultures of nations and nationalities.\u201d"

His grandfather, James Madison Porter, was one of the college's founders. Porter III served on the civil engineering faculty at Lafayette from 1890 to 1917 and was an early advocate for materials testing. In addition to his academic achievements, Porter designed the Northampton Street Bridge between Easton, Pennsylvania, and Phillipsburg, New Jersey, which is now one of few eyebar cantilever bridges remaining in the U.S. and notable for its high level of ornamentation. Porter also served as consulting engineer to John A. Roebling and Sons on the Riegelsville Bridge further downstream, a wire-rope suspension bridge. Both bridges have national significance for their unique designs and have been documented by the Historic American Engineering Record. Drawings and calculations for these bridges are among Porter's papers collected at the Northampton County Historical and Genealogical Society, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission archives, and in Special Collections at Lafayette College's Skillman Library."

He has served at senior levels in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). He is currently the President of Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), an advocacy nonprofit that forges lasting solutions to the environmental challenges for the people of New England. Campbell was born in Northeast Philadelphia. His Lebanese family had adopted the surname \"Campbell\" as an American version of its family name Kamel and his father gave him the middle name \"McAllerton\" to make him sound as Americanized as possible. His father died when Bradley was eight years old, so he was raised by Jewish stepfathers and an uncle; he would say in jest that his \"aspiration is to become ambassador-at-large in the Middle East\". He attended the Friends' Central School and learned to sail during summers spent at the Echo Hill Outdoor School. Campbell earned his undergraduate degree from Amherst College in 1983 and was awarded a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School, where he was an editor of the University of Chicago Law Review. After graduating he was a law clerk for United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judge Carl E. McGowan. He entered private practice as an attorney at the firm of Rogovin, Huge & Schiller, working on civil and criminal litigation, representing environmental organizations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Campbell served on the White House Council on Environmental Quality, overseeing executive office policy on issues including agricultural policy, brownfield land and Superfund sites. At the United States Department of Justice, he was lead counsel in the case Kelley v. EPA on lender liability which reaffirmed the obligation of polluters to cover the costs of cleaning up Superfund sites. In 1993, Campbell received the Arthur S. Flemming Award for distinguished government service, which is based on a national competition. He was also chosen that year to receive the John Marshall Award, the highest level of recognition granted by the Department of Justice. Campbell was nominated by President Clinton on December 15, 1999, to serve as the Regional Administrator of EPA's Middle Atlantic Region succeeding W. Michael McCabe, who had been named Deputy Administrator. As regional administrator, in cooperation with governors and senior state officials, Campbell directed the implementation of federal environmental programs in the states of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Campbell took office as head of NJDEP in January 2002, having been nominated to the post by Governor Jim McGreevey. In October 2004 Senator Anthony Bucco of Morris County invoked senatorial courtesy to block four nominations to the Highlands Commission. Bucco sought to register his concern about how the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act would limit development in the New Jersey Highlands, and dropped his block after Campbell met with Bucco, Senator Guy R.

Holch earned an Emmy Award for a 1991 documentary broadcast on HBO documenting the life of a German man who had been a member of the Hitler Youth and then turned against the Nazis. Holch was born on March 13, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska. Raised in Denver, he earned his undergraduate degree there from the University of Denver and was awarded a master's degree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. During the Korean War, Holch served as a military intelligence officer in United States Army Reserve, stationed in Tokyo. He started in the news field as a reporter at the Rocky Mountain News before heading east. Moving to New York City, Holch was hired by CBS Radio and then for the NBC television network. Establishing Round Hill Productions for his own independent work, Holch wrote the script for the hour-long documentary Walk in My Shoes which was produced and directed by Nicholas Webster. The film, nominated for an Emmy Award, was broadcast on ABC television in 1961, though some stations in the South pre-empted the show, with a Chattanooga, Tennessee station choosing to air a Billy Graham program in its place. The documentary featured profiles of African American life across social classes in New York City as seen through the eyes of such individuals as taxi divers, comedian Dick Gregory and lawyer-turned-politician Percy Sutton. The New York Herald Tribune credited \"Walk in My Shoes\" with providing \"an infinitely deeper understanding and sense of concern for an appalling American problem\" and said it was \"one of the finest documentaries ever offered on television\". Television critic Jack Gould of The New York Times called Walk in My Shoes \"nothing short of an unforgettable visit to the world of the Negro in the United States\" providing \"a viewer the sobering experience of living for a moment in the Negro's world and sharing the frustration that is his lot\" that was captured \"to a degree never before achieved in TV documentary\". Heil Hitler! Confessions of a Hitler Youth was a half-hour documentary Holch developed for HBO, which described Alfons Heck who had been a member of the Hitler Youth in his teens and had been a vigorous supporter of Adolf Hitler, but had turned against the Nazis and spoke widely about his transformation. The film won a 1992 Emmy Award for News & Documentary. He also created documentaries about life behind the Iron Curtain which were broadcast on ABC, producing and directing the 1967 film The Beautiful Blue and Red Danube and Cuba: The Castro Generation in 1977. His 1972 work Chile: Experiment in Red documented life under the rule of Salvador Allende. A resident of Greenwich, Connecticut since 1955, Holch later learned that he came from one of the city's founding families. At the time of his death he was working on Greenwich: The Golden Apple: Big Bucks, Big Names, Big Deals, a book about Greenwich over the past two centuries. Holch died in a hospital in Greenwich at the age of 86 on September 23, 2010, due to heart failure. He was survived by his wife, the former Ellen O'Keefe Hare, as well as by four daughters, three sons, and seven grandchildren."

She won the Potter Exhibition prize in 1888 and the Bennett Prize in 1889. After completing her studies, she performed as a pianist and taught music in London. There are claims that she was proposed to by Sir Henry Wood, whom she turned down. One of her compositions, Romaunt of the Page, had its premiere at one of the Promenade Concerts on 6 October 1899. She eventually married Nicholas Paramythioti (1871\u20131943) a businessman from Corfu, on 22 August 1903, one of many lodgers at the house in Hampstead (17 Goldhurst Terrace)  that the family used to let rooms to.  Around this time she and Nicholas moved to France (where her two children were born, John in 1904 and Pamela in 1906) and she divided her time between France and Margate (where her parents had retired to and where they are both buried, having succumbed to the influenza epidemic, dying within a few days of each other in 1913). She kept a diary, (which spans the years 1907 to 1918)  which she wrote as a sort of \u2018life-guidance manual\u2019 for her two children. These few entries give an insight into her opinions about music and composition."

New's research has focused on legislation that restricts abortion. His secondary research area is on tax-limitation amendments, such as Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights. His studies have been widely cited by pro-life groups, to argue for the effectiveness of various types of state level laws restricting abortion rights, including informed consent laws, parental involvement laws, and public funding restrictions. His research has also been used to validate Presidential platforms for and against abortion restrictions.  His studies have also been used by pro-life groups to encourage former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani to support abortion restrictions, and to challenge claims by former DNC Chair Howard Dean.  As well, his studies on tax limitation amendments have been used by both supporters of California's Proposition 13 and supporters of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights fiscal limit in Colorado. New is an adjunct scholar at the CATO Institute, and is a fellow at the Witherspoon Institute.

Torrey was a great-grandson of Manasseh Cutler who had been a member of the United States Congress.  His father, Augustus Torrey, was a medical doctor.  Torrey was born in Beverly, Massachusetts.  He moved to the household of his uncle Joseph Torrey to go to Burlington High School.  He then studied at the University of Vermont, completing his bachelor's degree in 1858.  After teaching school for a time in Beverly, Massachusetts, he went to the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York from which he graduated in 1864.  He was an ordained Congregational minister in Vergennes, Vermont until he was appointed to the faculty of the University of Vermont in 1868, taking on the Chair that had previously belonged to his uncle.  He also served as secretary of the University starting in 1871, the year the university began to admit women. A \"sound philosopher\", Torrey was an Intuitionist, as well as possessing a strong interest in Immanuel Kant, having \"cut his philosophical teeth\" on the Critique of Pure Reason. Nevertheless, Torrey did not follow any single philosophical system, and as a result he encouraged his students towards inquiry over the following of a particular approach. Torrey taught John Dewey both when Dewey was a student at the University of Vermont and later in one-on-one sessions, in particular when Dewey returned to Vermont in the early 1880s to teach in a private academy. This period of private tuition was a considerable influence on Dewey, as it was this period when Torrey pointed Dewey towards a career in philosophy. Torrey's interest in Kant and the emphasis he placed on Kant's writings in his teaching influenced Dewey's early work, as evidenced in Dewey's first four publications. In 1865 he married Sarah Paine Torrey, a daughter of his uncle Joseph Torrey, and thus his first cousin."

Hawkins graduated in 1950 from the University of Washington with a degree in English.  He married Kathleen Marie Gallaner and worked for Boeing (as did Pynchon) in the early fifties, then in Beaumont, Texas in television, for station KFDM, and in advertising.  In 1960, Hawkins moved to San Francisco to join the Beats, supporting himself as a postal worker. After his work was rejected by local Beat publications, he took to self-publishing under the name \"Tiger Tim\" Hawkins. As a fan of William Gaddis, Hawkins discovered newspaper, the self-published Gaddis fansheet of \"jack green\". He became convinced that green was Gaddis, a detail that would show up in the Tinasky letters. Tinasky also claimed, \"The novels of William Gaddis and Thomas Pynchon were written by the same person\". After Hawkins retired, he and Kathleen moved to Mendocino County just outside Fort Bragg, where they lived in poverty for most of the eighties. Hawkins engaged in petty scams and thefts, and took to disguising himself. Kathleen came into an inheritance and bought a car for herself and a pickup truck for her husband.

He was a graduate of the University of Michigan where he played college football for the 1879 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first football team to represent the University of Michigan. Campbell was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1858.  His father James V. Campbell was a New York native who came to Detroit at age three in 1826.  His father was a regent and law professor at the University of Michigan and a member of the Michigan Supreme Court.  His mother Cornelia (Hotchkiss) Campbell was also a native of New York. Campbell attended the public schools and high schools in Detroit, graduating in 1876.  He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1876 and completed \"the Latin and scientific course.\"  While studying at Michigan, Campbell played at the halfback position for the 1879 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first football team to represent the University of Michigan.  The first football game for the University of Michigan was a May 30, 1879, game against Racine at White Stockings field in Chicago.  Campbell took the opening kickoff in that first football game, a play described in a newspaper the next day as follows: The University team won the choice and let the Racine team have the kick.  Johnston made a fair kick which was caught by Campbell and carried forward some distance by good runs and skilled throwing to others of our team. Campbell was also a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity while at Michigan.  A notebook kept by Campbell while he was a student at Michigan from 1879 to 1880, which includes lecture notes from James B. Angell's courses in political economy and international law, is maintained in the collections of the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library.  Campbell received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from the University of Michigan in 1880. Campbell studied law at the office of Alfred Russell starting in 1880, and was admitted to the Michigan Bar in 1882.  He went into practice with Russel at the firm of Russell & Campbell in 1886.  The firm later became known as Russell, Campbell & Bulkley (1905\u20131907), and later as Russell, Campbell, Bulkley & Ledyard (1907\u20131912), and eventually Campbell, Bulkley & Ledyard (after 1912).  Campbell specialized in conveyancing and trusts.  In his history of the City of Detroit, Clarence M. Burton wrote: \"For many years Mr. Campbell has been recognized as one of the most eminent members of the Michigan bar.\" Campbell was also active in Detroit's civic affairs.  In 1920, he was selected as the president of the Detroit Board of Commerce.  He also served as the secretary of the Woodlawn Cemetery Association, trustee of Detroit's famed Mariners' Church, treasurer and director of the River Rouge Improvement Co., and a member of the board of trustees of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of Michigan. In the 1910s, Campbell lived in the Pasadena Apartments, then one of the most fashionable apartment houses in Detroit.  Campbell never married.  At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Campbell lived in Apartment 148 at the Pasadena Apartments with his sister, Cornelia."

He was in France, for the purpose of finishing his education, in 1793, when, in pursuance of the decree of the Convention for the arrest of strangers, he was thrown into prison at Dijon, where he remained for fifteen months. There he made the acquaintance of Mme. de Guitaut, whose hospitality he accepted until his return to England, after the signature of the Treaty of Amiens. He was again in France on the renewal of the war in 1803, and was again imprisoned, but not for long. Frisell now took up his residence at Paris, where he lived during the remainder of his life, spending, however, a portion of each year in travel, and in visits to Mme. de Guitaut and her husband at \u00c9poisses. He became the intimate friend of Chateaubriand, Joubert, Fontanes, and their circle. In memory of Frisell's daughter \u00c9lisa (or Louisa), who died at Passy in 1832 aged 17, Chateaubriand, while in prison on charge of participation in the Duchesse de Berry's attempt to overthrow the Orl\u00e9anist r\u00e9gime, composed the touching stanzas, Jeune Fille et Jeune Fleur, and portions of the affectionate correspondence between Frisell and Joubert have been preserved. He died while on a visit to England in February 1846. Frisell was a man of considerable accomplishments. Chateaubriand called him \"le Gr\u00e9co-Anglais\", and Count Marcellus, while styling him fantastic, testifies to his culture and knowledge. His manner is described as reserved and his conversation sarcastic, with an affectation of indifference which annoyed his friends, particularly Mme. de Chateaubriand; but he was generally beloved. The only work that he is known to have written is an \u00c9tude sur la Constitution de l'Angleterre, avec des remarques sur l'ancienne Constitution de la France, 1820."

She graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 2003 and completed her postgraduate degree at Royal Academy of Arts in 2006. In the same year, she was awarded the prestigious Deutsche Bank Award in Fine Art. Highly regarded for her site-specific work in the public realm, she has since undertaken commissions that include the Folkestone Triennial (2017), Songdo Tech City (2016), Liverpool Biennial (2012), The Southbank Centre (2008), and TFL Art on the Underground (2007). She held the inaugural Bridget Riley Fellowship 2016\u201317 at the British School at Rome, is the recipient of the British Council\u2019s International Development Award and was shortlisted for the Jerwood Painting Prize. She lives and works between London and Bali. Tantra\u2019s practice is diverse, ranging from painted canvases, to site-specific sculptural interventions, to large-scale public artworks. She describes her work as 'painting on an architectural scale'. Colour is central to her practice, as a 'material which lies between the language of art and industry'. Her distinctive palette is inspired by her Balinese heritage and childhood holidays: 'I remember things through colour \u2013  especially the way in which colours vibrate against each other. I like the idea of \u2018colour semiotics\u2019 and the associations one has to particular colours in relationship to either brand or narrative.' Her work has been described as \"exuberant\", a \"hedonistic celebration of excess and decoration\", and her contribution to public art by transforming spaces with \"chaotic yet captivating images\" has been recognised by collectors and commissioners alike. Her 2010 work Universe of Objects in Archive, Arsenic and Railings praised for lifting the perspective \"like the energy of a released spring and pulses horizontally around the room in endless optical trigonometric fugue\"."

She was instrumental in the creation of the Canaveral National Seashore in 1975, and the Spruce Creek Preserve, renamed the Doris Leeper Spruce Creek Preserve in memoriam. She founded the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1982. She was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1999. Leeper was born on April 4, 1929, in Charlotte, North Carolina. She attended Duke University, originally intending to become a brain surgeon \u2013 the origin of her nickname \"Doc.\" She eventually graduated in 1951 with a degree in art history. In 1958, while working in the field of commercial art, she moved to the small community of Eldora, Florida, situated on a barrier island between New Smyrna Beach and Titusville, Florida. As a result of her presence there, Leeper became increasingly interested in environmental preservation. By 1961, she had become a full-time artist, specializing in painting and sculpture. Her work is in over 100 collections in the U.S. and abroad. By the early 1970s, Leeper was a well-known figure in the Florida environmental movement, and was instrumental in the 1975 creation of the Canaveral National Seashore (CANA), which encompassed the island on which Eldora was located. In 1975 she founded Friends of Canaveral and appointed to the Canaveral National Seashore Advisory Commission where she pushed for wilderness protection for the seashore. Leeper conceived of the Atlantic Center for the Arts in 1977, envisioning it as a Florida artist-in-residence program in which artists of all disciplines could work with current prominent artists in a supportive and creative environment. Leeper saw the potential for an artist's residency as a place for ideas to be created, shared, and come into fruition. She soon persuaded friends and community members to join in her vision. In 1979, she convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to provide a challenge grant that soon was matched. This $25,000 in seed money was the unofficial inception of the ACA. When a prime piece of property became available on the shores of Turnbull Bay, a tidal estuary west of New Smyrna Beach, Leeper raised the $50,000 necessary to buy the ten-acre plot. Three years later, five main buildings were completed. Over the years, five more buildings were constructed and an additional 59 acres were purchased as preserve land. The ACA officially opened in 1982 for the first residency with author James Dickey, sculptor Duane Hanson, and composer David Del Tredici. Since then, over 155 interdisciplinary residencies have taken place, featuring over 430 Master Artists and over 3,500 Associate Artists from around the world. Leeper was awarded honorary doctorates from Duke and from Stetson University. She was named Florida ambassador of the arts, and inducted into the Florida Hall of Fame in 1999.  A 45-year retrospective of her work was held at Cornell Fine Arts Museum in 1995. She died April 11, 2000 as the last resident of Eldora. After her death, the management of the town was officially turned over to the federal government, as the town is located more than two miles within the borders of the Canaveral National Seashore. The town claims no permanent residents and visitation is limited and subject to park hours. Only two of its original buildings remain. In 2020, Leeper's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places."

Worcestershire were then dismissed in their first-innings for 197, with Sussex forcing them to follow-on in their second-innings, with Worcestershire making 240 all out, which left Sussex with a target of 39 for victory. Sussex reached their target in their second-innings without losing any wickets. This was his only major appearance for Sussex. Outside of cricket, he was a brewer.

Jabez Huntington graduated from Yale in 1741, engaged in the West India trade, and amassed a fortune. After 1759 he was frequently a member of the legislature, speaker for several years, and also a member of the council. At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, he owned a large amount of shipping, and lost heavily by the capture of his vessels. He was among the most active on the committee of safety during the war; and in the September 1776 session of the Connecticut assembly he and David Wooster were appointed Major Generals.  On the death of Wooster in 1777 Jabez was placed in charge of the entire Connecticut militia.  His great exertions in the patriot cause and his heavy losses impaired his physical and mental powers, and he was thus compelled to resign his employments in 1779."

Viswanathan had a reputation of being the \u2018eyes and ears of Delhi\u2019 and often took an anti-Communist line. He sparred with the then Chief Minister EMS Namboodiripad and once almost precipitated a constitutional crisis, when he prepared his own address to the Kerala Legislature.

He achieved notoriety in 1995 when he asserted that rape victims could not get pregnant.  In the context of a debate regarding whether the state should stop funding abortions for poor women, he stated, \"The facts show that people who are raped, who are truly raped, the juices don't flow, the body functions don't work, and they don't get pregnant.\"  He later stated that his comments were \"stupid.\"   Aldridge's 1995 comments were revisited in August 2012, in light of controversy surrounding U.S. Senate Candidate Todd Akin's similar comments. He was re-elected to his seat in 1996.  In 1998, Aldridge also received some press attention when, noting a report that non-white infant mortality rates were nearly twice as high as for white infants, commented that he doubted the report \"because it seems that most of the black people I know are bigger and tougher and stronger than whites.\"  Aldridge said afterwards that his comments were intended to be complimentary, as \"Black men are generally bigger, strong, better athletes.  I would suggest that you take a look at the professional baseball, basketball, and football teams.\" Aldridge retired from office in 1998, after losing to Democratic candidate Marian N. McLawhorn in the 1998 election.  He died at age 78 on February 2, 2002. Aldridge was also very active in community organizations, serving as president of the Pitt-Greenville Chamber of Commerce, Greenville Lion's Club, Greenville Boy's Club, and Greenville Little League.

He was born in Lakeland, Florida, and attended Lakeland High School, where he was an all-state football and basketball player. He was recruited by several top college programs and chose to accept a scholarship to play for coach Charley Pell at the University of Florida. Peace became the Gators' starting quarterback just five games into his freshman season of 1980 when a knee injury to starter Bob Hewko propelled the rookie into the lineup, and he performed well enough to keep the starting job for most of the next three and a half seasons.  Over his career at Florida, Peace lead the Gators to a 28-12-1 record, four bowl games, and their first ever top-10 ranking in the final AP Poll (No. 6 in 1983). He set several individual records as well; his career completion percentage (61.6%) was a school record and his 7,206 passing yards were second in school history when he graduated.  During his junior season in 1982, Peace set an NCAA record for completion percentage (70.7%) which was broken by Steve Young the following year.  Peace appeared on the cover of the September 13, 1982 cover of Sports Illustrated. In one of a series of articles written for The Gainesville Sun in 2006, the Sun sportswriters ranked him as No. 81 all-time greatest Gator of the first 100 years of Florida football.  He was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great.\" In the spring of 1984, Peace signed with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League (USFL), who were coached by former Florida quarterback Steve Spurrier.  Peace played in several games, sharing time under center with another Florida alumnus, John Reaves.  After the league folded, Peace was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players, the second USFL quarterback picked after Steve Young. However, he was waived during preseason camp in August 1985. Peace tried out for several other National Football League (NFL) teams over the next two seasons, signing briefly with the Miami Dolphins and playing in preseason games with the San Diego Chargers, but he did not make a regular season roster and decided to retire from football in late 1986. Peace graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in marketing in 1986.  In February 1987, he founded a State Farm insurance agency in his hometown of Lakeland.  In 2006, while continuing to run his insurance agency, Peace became the quarterbacks coach for the high school team at Lakeland Christian School.  In January 2011, he was named head football coach at the school, and has led his team to 6-5 and 7-3 records in his first two seasons."

Manley and colleagues identified and characterized the key factors responsible for polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, and elucidated how this remarkably complex machinery functions in gene regulation, for example during cell growth and differentiation. He has also studied the mechanism and regulation of the process by which introns are removed from mRNA precursors, mRNA splicing. Manley and his coworkers codiscovered the first alternative splicing factor (SR protein), characterized how this and other splicing regulatory proteins function and are themselves regulated, showed how alternative splicing can become deregulated in disease, and with respect to mechanism demonstrated that two spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs by themselves have catalytic activity. Finally, he elucidated unexpected links between these mRNA processing reactions and transcription, DNA damage signaling and maintenance of genomic stability.  His work has thus provided considerable insight into the complex mechanisms that are essential for the regulated production of mRNAs in mammalian cells."

        "content": "George Viner Ellis FRS (25 September 1812 Minsterworth - 25 April 1900 Minsterworth) was Professor of Anatomy at University College London and one of the foremost anatomists of his time. George Viner was the second son of Viner Ellis of Duni House, Minsterworth, near Gloucester, his family having been landowners in the area for many years. His education was at the Crypt Grammar School from where he went to the Cathedral Grammar School, and later was apprenticed to a Dr Buchanan of Gloucester. His uncle, Daniel Ellis, a member of the Royal Society Edinburgh, suggested that he enrol as a medical student at the newly founded University College London. In his vacations he studied in Paris and attended lectures and worked at anatomy in Berlin. Ellis was Demonstrator of Anatomy under Professor Richard Quain, and succeeded him in the Chair of Anatomy in 1850, retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1877, but always aloof from the professional world. He was succeeded by Sir George Dancer Thane (1850-1930). Ellis was one of the great names of the world of anatomy in England, having given all his working life to the study and teaching of this discipline, and was held in the highest respect. His lectures were conscientiously precise and lucid, so that his students always paid close attention. In 1840 he published \"Demonstrations of Anatomy: being a Guide to the Knowledge of the Human Body by Dissections\", his name becoming a household word among medical students, and his work becoming the standard textbook in England and the United States. The 11th edition of his book was published in 1890. University College London in its first thirty-five years of existence, published an extraordinary number of anatomical atlases. Ellis carried on this tradition by collaborating with the South African natural history illustrator, George Henry Ford, to produce some of the best anatomical artwork ever published. They used the relatively new technique of chromolithography for their imperial folio atlas of fifty-eight plates, \"Illustrations of Dissections in a Series of Original Coloured Plates the Size of Life\". The plates were done between 1863 and 1867, with from four to seven completed each year. These plates are considered exceptionally clear and accurate, with an aesthetic depiction of the cadavers, printed by Mintern Bros., and published by James Walton. During Ellis' tenure the University College London was regarded as the pre-eminent centre for the study of anatomy, its spacious and well-lit dissecting room approved of by both staff and students. The College was fortunate in acquiring and retaining the services of an anatomist of Ellis' stature - his culture, zeal, and energy were legendary - receiving only a moderate salary and with no prospect of career improvement. In Ellis' day cadavers were not treated with any preservatives, so that they were often in an advanced state of putrefaction, limiting dissection to the winter months. Several times he acted as Examiner in Anatomy at the University of London, but declined to join the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of Surgeons. On his retirement Ellis came into a small fortune left him by a relative, built himself a house at Minsterworth, 'Severn Bank', and lived there quietly with his younger sister, devoting himself to gardening and apple-growing. He also ran night classes for the older boys of the parish. A few years before his death he became blind and was tended by his sister. \"Ellis' muscle\", the Corrugator cutis ani muscle, is named after him."

The daughter of Dutch-born classical scholar Nicholas P. Vlachos - a professor at Temple University -  Westcott was born in Philadelphia and raised in the area, graduating from Swarthmore High School. While on summer vacation in Avalon (New Jersey) - after attending Swarthmore College for a year - she met and eloped with Richard J. Westcott in 1931, the couple then residing in Camden (New Jersey) where Jan Westcott became a \"stay at home mom\" to the couple's two sons. Her longstanding interest in history, passed down from her father, was reinforced by the occurrence of World War II and after her husband left to join the army in 1943 Westcott tried her hand at writing a historical novel, which she worked on while her sons were in school and after putting them to bed: the resultant novel: The Border Lord, was published in 1946. Divorcing her first husband in 1947, Westcott in 1954 married Robert Phelps Barden the chief radiologist of Chestnut Hill Hospital (Philadelphia): the couple - who had met while both were summering in Avalon - subsequently resided for many years in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill neighborhood. Westcott, whose fifth novel: The Walsingham Woman, had been published in 1953, had a lower-volume writing career during her second marriage with her eleventh and final novel: A Woman of Quality, being published in 1978, thirty-two years after Westcott's inaugural novel and thirty-three years before the author's passing at age 99. While promoting her 1969 novel The White Rose - the result of three years work - Westcott asserted doing thorough research for her novels via the UPenn library. Westcott was indeed praised by some reviewers for her attention to detail - one notice for Captain Barney stated \"[she] gets her inspiration from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" -  although others questioned the authenticity of her books. Nevertheless, The Border Lord became a Literary Guild selection, and The Queen's Grace was serialized in the Ladies' Home Journal. Westcott's first two novels in particular were successful, both The Border Lord and Captain For Elizabeth (1948) ranking as New York Times Bestsellers and reportedly each selling a million copies. Cited as a source of inspiration by romance novelists Karen Harper, Shirlee Busbee, Susanna Kearsley, and Bertrice Small. Jan Westcott had had her papers archived at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University."
