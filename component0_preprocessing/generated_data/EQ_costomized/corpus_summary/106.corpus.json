        "content": "Joe Bianchi (August 5, 1871 in Origgio, Italy \u2013 May 29, 1949) was a world-class spur maker who immigrated to Victoria, Texas in December 1885 and died in Victoria at the age of 77. Bianchi's particular style became known across Southwest Texas as the Victoria Shank or bottle-opener spur, terms which are still used today by collectors, some sixty years after production of these much sought-after custom, handmade spurs ceased.Bianchi's father, Luigi (Louis), purchased a farm after arriving in Texas. The 1900 Census listed Louis and his youngest son as farmer. By contrast, Joe and his older brother Paul were listed as blacksmith by trade at the time of their arrival, no doubt due to some experience gained in Italy.\nBianchi worked in partnership with other blacksmith shops, including with brother Paul at Bianchi Brothers Blacksmith Shop in 1901. Sometime after his marriage to Mathilde Urban on February 22, 1905, Bianchi opened his own shop next to their home on South William Street. This shop became a popular place for family, friends, cowboys and cattlemen to meet and visit. One could purchase spurs, bits, and branding irons and have repairs made to carriages, farming implements and household items. Bianchi built park benches for the city square around 1920.  As a testimony to the quality of his work, a number of these benches can still be seen in Victoria over 80 years later.After the introduction of the automobile resulted in a switch among the population away from horse and buggy, Paul's work turned to the automobile while Joe continued to concentrate on the needs of the cowboys and cattlemen, in particular, the spurs, bits and branding irons needed for their work. In addition to the distinctive bottle-opener style, some spurs and bits made by the Bianchi brothers can also be identified by markings such as BIANCHI, HANDFORGED and VICTORIA, TEX.\n \nBianchi offered to repair or replace any spur that proved defective without charge.  He also created a pocket size catalog so his products could be ordered by mail.  As a result, his products found a market throughout the United States and some foreign countries. He also placed advertisements in The Cattleman magazine as well as the Running W Saddle Shop catalog of the famous King Ranch in south Texas.\n \nJoe was also known for his support of the church and various schools in town. He also joined the local Spanish American militia unit and was an active member of the Victoria Fire Department right up to the final years of his life. For his industriousness, civic mindedness and decent living, Joe was highly respected by all who knew and worked with him."

        "title": "Epicurus_sum",
        "content": "Epicurus (, EH-pih-KURE-\u0259s; Greek: \u1f18\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Epikouros; 341\u2013270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and sage who founded Epicureanism, a highly influential school of philosophy. He was born on the Greek island of Samos to Athenian parents. Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as \"the Garden\", in Athens. Epicurus and his followers were known for eating simple meals and discussing a wide range of philosophical subjects. He openly allowed women and slaves to join the school as a matter of policy. Of the over 300 works said to have been written by Epicurus about various subjects, the vast majority have been destroyed. Only three letters written by him\u2014the letters to Menoeceus, Pythocles, and Herodotus\u2014and two collections of quotes\u2014the Principal Doctrines and the Vatican Sayings\u2014have survived intact, along with a few fragments of his other writings. As a result of his work's destruction, most knowledge about his philosophy is due to later authors, particularly the biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, the Epicurean Roman poet Lucretius and the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, as well as the hostile but largely accurate accounts by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and the Academic Skeptic and statesman Cicero.\nEpicurus asserted that philosophy's purpose is to attain as well as to help others attain happy (eudaimonic), tranquil lives characterized by ataraxia (peace and freedom from fear) and aponia (the absence of pain). He advocated that people were best able to pursue philosophy by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that the root of all human neuroses is denial of death and the tendency for human beings to assume that death will be horrific and painful, which he claimed causes unnecessary anxiety, selfish self-protective behaviors, and hypocrisy. According to Epicurus, death is the end of both the body and the soul and therefore should not be feared. Epicurus taught that although the gods exist, they have no involvement in human affairs. He taught that people should act ethically not because the gods punish or reward them for their actions but because, due to the power of guilt, amoral behavior would inevitably lead to remorse weighing on their consciences and as a result, they would be prevented from attaining ataraxia. \nEpicurus derived much of his physics and cosmology from the earlier philosopher Democritus (c. 460\u2013c. 370 BC). Like Democritus, Epicurus taught that the universe is infinite and eternal and that all matter is made up of extremely tiny, invisible particles known as atoms. All occurrences in the natural world are ultimately the result of atoms moving and interacting in empty space. Epicurus deviated from Democritus by proposing the idea of atomic \"swerve\", which holds that atoms may deviate from their expected course, thus permitting humans to possess free will in an otherwise deterministic universe.\nThough popular, Epicurean teachings were controversial from the beginning. Epicureanism reached the height of its popularity during the late years of the Roman Republic. It died out in late antiquity, subject to hostility from early Christianity. Throughout the Middle Ages Epicurus was popularly, though inaccurately, remembered as a patron of drunkards, whoremongers, and gluttons. His teachings gradually became more widely known in the fifteenth century with the rediscovery of important texts, but his ideas did not become acceptable until the seventeenth century, when the French Catholic priest Pierre Gassendi revived a modified version of them, which was promoted by other writers, including Walter Charleton and Robert Boyle. His influence grew considerably during and after the Enlightenment, profoundly impacting the ideas of major thinkers, including John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, Jeremy Bentham, and Karl Marx."

Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, O'Reily studied for the priesthood in Dublin.  Upon his ordination in 1869, he migrated to Western Australia, serving as a parish priest in Fremantle, and founding a Catholic newspaper there.  When the Diocese of Port Augusta was established in 1887, Pope Leo XIII named O'Reily as its first bishop.  Concerned about the financial position of the diocese (which had inherited significant debt from the Diocese of Adelaide), he accepted the posting reluctantly.  As bishop, he greatly improved the financial position of the new diocese, reducing its debt by half and earning a reputation as a competent administrator.\nIn 1894, O'Reily was appointed to replace the deceased Christopher Reynolds as Archbishop of Adelaide.  The archdiocese he inherited was burdened with substantial debt, again left over from the old Diocese of Adelaide. Through the sale of church assets and a fundraising campaign, O'Reily was able to eliminate most of the Archdiocese's liabilities while still investing in church infrastructure.  He also actively participated in public discussions relating to education policy at a time when the role of the state in supporting religious education was topical.  O'Reily publicly advocated government assistance for religious schools, stating that it was unfair Catholics paid taxes to support state schools, but received no funding for their own.  In the later years of his life, poor health forced him to spend less time attending to his episcopal duties, and from 1905, he largely retreated from public life.  At his request, Robert Spence was appointed as his coadjutor and successor in 1914, and on 6 July 1915, he died at his house in Adelaide.  O'Reily was highly regarded by many in South Australian society, with Adelaide's daily newspapers praising his character, administrative ability and positive relations with non-Catholics."

        "content": "Guillaume or William de Malveisin (also, modern forms Malvoisin or Mauvoisin) was Chancellor of Scotland, Bishop of Glasgow (1199/1200\u20131202) and then Bishop of St. Andrews (1202\u20131238).\nWilliam Malveisin was probably born in France. It is possible that he was the son of the nephew of the Count of Brittany, however it is much more likely that he came from a family of the name based on the lower Seine valley. William was likely the nephew of Samson de Malveisin, Archbishop of Rheims from 1140 to 1161. In this context, William's career can come as no surprise.\nWilliam appears in Scottish records for the first time in the 1180s, appearing as a royal clerk. In 1193, the royal patronage he had earned brought him his first known ecclesiastical post, as Archdeacon of Lothian. He was made the king's Chancellor probably on 8 September 1199, and was elected to the Bishopric of Glasgow in October the same year. He was consecrated at Lyon by Renaud de Forez, Archbishop of Lyon, in September 1200. However, two years later in the same month, he was translated to the higher ranking Bishopric of St. Andrews. William got into a little trouble for exercising his episcopal powers before his episcopate had been confirmed by the Pope, then Innocent III; a charge was brought against him by one of his canons, a man named Eustace. The charge was heard by the Papal legate, John of Salerno, who held a council at Perth in December 1201, before leaving for business in Ireland. Legate John once again visited Scotland on his way back from Ireland, staying for more than fifty days at Melrose. However, nothing came of the charge.Walter Bower relates that William received the permission of King William to visit his relatives in France. This was perhaps between May 1212 and Spring 1213, when Bishop William disappears from the records. When not visiting home, Bishop William, like most other Bishops of St. Andrews, was keen to expand the power of the bishopric. In one instance, when Gille \u00cdsu, the hereditary priest of Wedale (Peebleshire) died, he took the opportunity to absorb the church into his diocese. Bishop William enjoyed good relations with the native Scottish clerical order of his diocese, the people \"qui Keledei vulgariter appellantur\" (commonly called C\u00e9li D\u00e9, Gaelic for \"Vassals of God\"). At some point between 1206 and 1216, and again in 1220, he managed to obtain absolution from the sentence of excommunication bestowed on the C\u00e9li D\u00e9 by the Pope; it may be that Bishop William's patronage ensured the opening priesthoods of its church, the Church of St Mary on the Rock at St. Andrews, to non-native clergy, to men such as Henry de Weles, and encouraged the order to consolidate its position vis-\u00e0-vis the papacy.According to the arguments of D.D.R. Owen, William was not only a bishop, but an author of Arthurian romance. The author of the romance known to us as the Roman de Fergus identifies himself as Guillaume le Clerc, or William the Clerk. In the words of Owen, \"it is most reasonable to keep our eyes open for any French clerk by the name of William (Guillaume)\" in the period concerned, and Owen uses textual and contextual evidence to show that William de Malveisin is one of the most likely known candidates.Bishop William died at a place called \"Inchemordauch\" (Inis Muiredaich), one of the Bishopric's manors, in 1238, probably on 9 July. The next consecrated Bishop of St. Andrews was David de Bernham."

Jones was largely responsible for the programme's innovative, surreal structure, in which sketches flowed from one to the next without the use of punch lines. He made his directorial debut with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which he co-directed with Gilliam, and also directed the subsequent Python films Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life.\nJones co-created and co-wrote with Palin the anthology series Ripping Yarns. He also wrote an early draft of Jim Henson's film Labyrinth and is credited with the screenplay, though little of his work actually remained in the final cut. Jones was a well-respected medieval historian, having written several books and presented television documentaries about the period, as well as a prolific children's author. In 2016, Jones received a Lifetime Achievement award at the BAFTA Cymru Awards for his outstanding contribution to television and film. After living for several years with a degenerative aphasia, he gradually lost the ability to speak and died in 2020 from frontotemporal dementia."

        "content": "Gustav Cohn (12 December 1840 in Marienwerder, West Prussia \u2013 17 September 1919) was a German economist, noted for his pioneering contributions to the theory and policy of transportation and public finance. He was educated at Berlin and Jena universities. During 1867 and 1868 he was the holder of a fellowship at the Royal Statistical Bureau of Berlin, and in 1869 became privat-docent at the University of Heidelberg, but in the same year accepted an invitation from the Polytechnikum at Riga. Cohn paid a visit to England in 1873, and the fruits of his observation and research were embodied in the masterly production \"Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik,\" 2 vols., Leipzig, 1874-75. In 1875, he was invited to fill the chair of economics at ETH Zurich, which he held until 1884, when he became professor in the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\nWhile at Zurich he prepared for publication his \"Volkswirtschaftliche Aufs\u00e4tze\" (Stuttgart, 1882), and contributed to the \"G\u00f6ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen\" (1880, i. 97-135) an exhaustive critical review of the first volume of Wagner's \"Allgemeine Volkswirtschaftlehre.\" The names of Wagner and Cohn have often been coupled, not only because both were classed among the Katheder-Socialisten, but also because they have much in common in their attitude toward the various so-called schools of economic science. In continuation of his study of the English railroad policy, and as the third volume of his earlier work on that subject, appeared his \"Die Englische Eisenbahnpolitik der Letzten Zehn Jahre,\" Leipzig, 1883.\nAfter his establishment at G\u00f6ttingen a period of ardent literary activity set in. The first volume of the greatest work which he has yet produced, his \"System der National\u00f6konomie,\" was published in 1885, the very next year after his arrival. It is significant of the importance and character of this work that two such great leaders of the respective opposing \"schools\" as Wagner and Schmoller should unite in praising it.\nIn 1886, he contributed to the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie\"(vol. xiii, No. 6), \"Zur Fabrikgesetzgebung,\" a review of government reports on factory legislation in Switzerland and Saxony, and to the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Gesetzgebung\" (x.3), \"Er\u00f6terungen \u00fcber die Fiskalische Behandlung der Verkehrsanstalten.\" In that year, too, appeared his \"National\u00f6konomische Studien,\" Stuttgart, 1886.\nThe year 1889 witnessed the publication of the second volume of his \"System der National\u00f6konomie,\" and his \"Finanzwissenschaft.\"\nCohn was elected a regular member of the Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften at G\u00f6ttingen in 1894; and in 1896 the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle of the fourth class was conferred upon him. After an interval of nearly ten years he completed the third volume of the \"System der National\u00f6konomie,\" which was also issued under the title \"National\u00f6konomie des Handelsund Verkehrswesens: Ein Lesebuch f\u00fcr Studierende,\" Stuttgart, 1898. To the \"Jahrbuch f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie\" (vi, Jan., 1901) he contributed \"Ueber die Vereinigung der Staatswissenschaften mit den Juristenfacult\u00e4ten.\""

He joined the French Communist Party at the age of 17 in 1939 when the Communist Party was banned for supporting the German-Soviet pact. In July 1940, he created a student club, the Centre la\u00efque des auberges de la jeunesse (Claj), which served as a legal screen for the clandestine Union of Communist Students.When David Rousset (1912-1997) spoke out about Stalin's vast system of prison camps, Daix attacked him as a liar, denying that the GULAG system existed in the Soviet Union, in a 16 page article in Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises, entitled \"Pourquoi M. David Rousset a-t-il invent\u00e9 les camps sovi\u00e9tiques?\". Rousset brought libel charges against Daix and there was a public trial in France, which Rousset, who had told the truth about the camps, won in 1950.  As a French communist, Daix continued his uncritical support for the Soviet Union for many years, though late in life he admitted he had been wrong.From 1980 to 1985, he was a journalist for Le Quotidien de Paris.\n\n\n== References =="

His recent work on branched chain fatty acids is particularly noteworthy. He showed, for example, that in cows fed grass silage the phytanic acid found in their plasma lipids originates from chlorophyll. He then went on to discover other novel branched-chain acids in sheep fed carbohydrate-rich diets. These compounds are of great significance arising, as they do, from excess propionate produced by rumen fermentation. This occurs because the conversion of propionate into methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A (a vitamin B-12 - dependent reaction) is rate-limiting and hence the ability of the animal to channel propionate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle is considerably reduced. This work opens up a completely new field of lipid biochemistry. \"The 55th International Conference on the Bioscience of Lipids, will be held in his memory."

Dagelet's astronomical sightings gave precision to the maps posthumously published in the official Atlas du Voyage de la Perouse (Paris: L'Imprimerie de la Republique, An V, 1797).\nYoung Dagelet arrived in Paris in 1767, welcomed by his uncles the renowned clockmakers Jean-Andr\u00e9 and Jean-Baptiste Lepaute, who held the brevet horlogers du Roi. Through his aunt, Nicole-Reine Lepaute, wife of Jean-Andr\u00e9, he discovered his aptitude for astronomy. From his arrival until 1772 he studied in the observatory of the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin, where he was guided by Joseph J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lefran\u00e7ois de Lalande.\nIn 1773 he departed for the South Seas with the expedition of Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Tr\u00e9marec; on his return he was made professor of mathematics at the \u00c9cole Militaire, Paris.\nDagelet is known particularly for having calculated the distance between the center of Mercury and the Sun and for his map of the solar eclipse of 1778. Dagelet discovered WY Sagittae, a nova in Sagitta (27-29 July 1783) and was a scientific observer of the balloon ascent of Jacques Alexandre C\u00e9sar Charles from the Champ de Mars, Paris, 27 August 1783.\nHe presented his observations of the planets and stars to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences and was received as adjoint and then named astronomer to the Academy in 1785, the year he embarked at Brest on the fatal expedition.\nAfter extensively mapping and recording the coastlines of North America, Japan, Korea and Siberia, Lap\u00e9rouse was directed by the French government to go to Botany Bay to observe the founding of the British Colony by the First Fleet. On 26 January 1788 Lap\u00e9rouse arrived at Botany Bay, just as the British were leaving for Port Jackson. The French ships stayed at Botany Bay for six weeks and built a stockade, observatory and a garden for fresh produce on the La Perouse peninsula. At Botany Bay Dagelet undertook calculations on map position of Botany Bay, carried out astronomical observations and met with William Dawes at Port Jackson. Dawes volunteered for service with the First Fleet and sailed on the Sirius. From February 1788, he was employed on shore to build an observatory at Dawes Point. Following this meeting Dagelet sent a letter to Dawes (1762-1836) with advice to Dawes on setting up his observatory, recent work on the fluctuations of the Earth's magnetic field and calculations on maps positions of Botany Bay.The island of Dagelet, named in his honour, is now known by its Korean name, Ulleungdo. In Alaska, Mount Dagelet still bears his name.\n\n\n== Notes =="

Bello is featured on the old 2,000 Venezuelan bol\u00edvar and the 20,000 Chilean peso notes.\nIn Caracas, where he was born, Andr\u00e9s Bello was Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's teacher for a short period of time and participated in the process that led to Venezuelan independence. As a diplomat for the new independent government that he helped establish, he went with Luis L\u00f3pez M\u00e9ndez and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar on their first diplomatic mission to London. He lived in London from 1810 to 1829.\nIn 1829, Bello went with his family to Chile. He was hired by the Chilean government and made great works in the field of law and humanities. In Santiago he held positions as a senator and a professor, as well as directing several local newspapers. As a legislator, he was the main promoter and editor of the Chilean Civil Code, one of the most innovative and influential American legal works of his time. In 1842, under his inspiration and with his decisive support,  the University of Chile was created, an institution of which he became the first rector, staying in the post for more than two decades. Due to his great contributions, on 17 October 1832 he was given Chilean nationality through a law approved by the Congress."

Internationally, his fame arises chiefly from his extensive body of choral music, which exceeds 500 individual choral songs, most of it a cappella. The great majority of these pieces are based on traditional ancient Estonian folksongs (regilaulud), either textually, melodically, or merely stylistically.\nHis composition most often performed outside Estonia, Curse Upon Iron (Raua needmine) (1972), invokes ancient Shamanistic traditions to construct an allegory about the evils of war. Some of his works were banned by the Soviet government, but because folk music was fundamental to his style most of his compositions were accepted by the censors.\nMore recently, Tormis' works have been performed and recorded by T\u00f5nu Kaljuste with the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and others. In the 1990s, Tormis began to receive commissions from some a cappella groups as the King's Singers and the Hilliard Ensemble.\nTormis famously said of his settings of traditional melodies and verse: \"It is not I who makes use of folk music, it is folk music that makes use of me.\" His work demonstrates his conviction that traditional Estonian and other Balto-Finnic music represents a treasure which must be guarded and nourished, and that culture may be kept alive through the medium of song."

He later implied that King was responsible for the war for not having articulated a clear policy within the British Commonwealth.Once World War II began, Ross urged the registration of all men and women in the country as a war measure in order to mobilize all Canadian resources for the war effort and to curb espionage. After the war, he advocated universal voluntary military training for high school and university students.\nRoss criticized Max Ferguson's popular satirical Rawhide show as \"meaningless ravings and tripe\" and as an insult to the intelligence of Canadians.In his professional life, Ross was vice-president of the Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company."

With his wife, Helen Watkins, he developed ego-state therapy, which uses analysis of underlying personalities, rather than traditional talk therapy, to find the causes of psychological problems.\nThe most famous example of the use of ego-state therapy was the interrogation of the Hillside Strangler, in which Watkins solicited a confession by revealing the killer's multiple personalities.Watkins also published research suggesting that hypnotic techniques for pain reduction may work by displacing the pain into \u201ccovert\u201d ego states. Accordingly, the pain is not eliminated by the hypnotic intervention but is dissociated from conscious awareness and fully experienced by an underlying ego state. The underlying ego state may suffer trauma as a result experiencing the pain.Watkins  graduated from the University of Idaho and received a Ph.D. from Columbia University. He was professor emeritus at the University of Montana, where he taught for many years.\nJohn G Watkins died on 12 January 2012. He was 98 years old."

It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central with release shortly after on Paramount+ of extended episodes. The Daily Show draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories as well as political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor.The half-hour-long show premiered on July 22, 1996, and was first hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 17, 1998. Jon Stewart then took over as the host from January 11, 1999, until August 6, 2015, making the show more strongly focused on political satire and news satire, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. Stewart was succeeded by Trevor Noah, whose tenure began on September 28, 2015. Under the different hosts, the show has been formally known as The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn from 1996 to 1998, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah from 2015 to 2022. The Daily Show is the longest-running program on Comedy Central (counting all three tenures), and has won 25 Primetime Emmy Awards.The program has been popular among young audiences. The Pew Research Center suggested in 2010 that 74% of regular viewers were between 18 and 49, and that 10% of the audience watched the show for its news headlines, 2% for in-depth reporting, and 43% for entertainment; compared with respectively 64%, 10% and 4%, who said the same of CNN. In 2015 The Daily Show's median age of viewership is 36 years old. In 2023 the viewership for age range of 25-54 year olds is 158k and the age range for 18-34 year olds is 30k.Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians, their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.In September 2022, Noah announced he would step down as the host of The Daily Show. His last episode as host was on December 8, 2022. As a new permanent host has not been chosen, the show has featured a rotating cast of guest hosts, with Jon Stewart returning to host Monday night shows starting February 12, 2024 and through the fall elections."

In his book Drum 'n' Bass: The Rough Guide, writer Peter Shapiro wrote that the track \"heard the sounds of '80s New York with a day-glo intensity and the track was all hot flashes and giddy energy that managed to dent the UK Top 40\", also describing it as \"one of the most exciting visions of an alternate hip-hop ever conceived.\"In 1994, he established the imprint Droppin' Science and began releasing as Danny Breaks, moving with the evolution of hardcore into jungle, and then into contemporary drum and bass. The label has been inactive since 2002, with Whiddett preferring to release increasingly experimental material on new label Alphabet Zoo.\nHe has also released records with True Playaz and Moving Shadow, and has additionally recorded under the names D.

She now lives in Hailey, Idaho, with her husband Bob, a hunter/jumper and trainer. Debbie trains and teaches riders on Peggy and E. Parry Thomas's River Grove Farm in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nMcDonald's first mount was an $800 pony. She agreed that she would pay for board if her parents bought it for her. Shortly thereafter Debbie managed to find a gaited horse trainer near her hometown who allowed her to groom horses and clean stalls in exchange for board.  At age 14,  when Debbie went to turn her pony out, she discovered a strange man in his stall, beating him. She went running for help and ran into a young trainer and her future husband, Bob McDonald, who ran a hunter/jumper farm and hired her as a stable hand.  It was at this facility that she began her career.McDonald began her career in show jumping. However, she switched to dressage after a serious fall in which her horse somersaulted over her breaking ribs, rupturing her spleen, and fracturing a vertebra in her neck,   She first met Parry and Peggy Thomas when she got a catch ride at a dressage show in Las Vegas on one of their horses whose rider was not available.The Thomases also became the owners of Brentina, a chestnut Hanoverian mare that became McDonald's primary mount. McDonald and her husband obtained the mare at an auction in Germany in 1994.  Brentina, foaled in 1991, had a suitable temperament to respect McDonald, who is only five feet tall, and the team established a partnership that took them to the Olympics. McDonald and Brentina began by winning the Individual and Team Gold medals at the 1999 Pan American Games.  In recognition of this accomplishment, McDonald was named the 1999 Equestrian of the Year by the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) Female Equestrian Athlete of the Year.   In 2003, McDonald become the first American rider to win the Dressage World Cup, and the pair placed third at the 2005 World Cup. As members of the United States Equestrian Team they won a team silver and team bronze at the 2002 and 2006 World Equestrian Games.  At the 2004 Athens Olympics, the pair won the team bronze and were individually fourth overall, and McDonald was dubbed  \"First Lady of American Dressage.\"Brentina was named the 2005 Farnam/Platform USEF Horse of the Year. After the 2008 Olympics, where the mare had an uncharacteristically poor performance, she was retired to the Thomas' farm. While McDonald went on to compete with other horses, Brentina developed an impaction in early 2009 and underwent colic surgery to remove a fecalith from her small colon.  She has since recovered and attended a retirement ceremony at the 2009 FEI World Cup Dressage Finals in Las Vegas.On January 22, 2010 McDonald was named the U.S. Equestrian Federation's Developing Dressage Coach, a role designed to identify and cultivate future US Dressage stars."

In 1970, he won Guggenheim, Fulbright and American-Scandinavian Foundation fellowships. When he was twenty-eight years old, he joined the faculty of Dartmouth College where he established one of the first electronic music studios in the United States. He remained there intermittently for forty-two years. In the mid-1970s, he left Dartmouth to briefly become the head of Elektronmusikstudion (EMS) (sv) in Stockholm, Sweden. In the late 1970s, together with Sydney Alonso and Cameron Jones, he helped develop the first commercial digital synthesizer called the Synclavier. For a decade he toured around the United States and Europe performing the compositions he composed for this instrument. In the early 1990s, he helped found the Theremin Center for Electronic Music at the Moscow Conservatory of Music. He also taught at Keio University (Mita) in Tokyo, Japan, CCRMA at Stanford University and the University of California Santa Cruz. In his later years, he devoted most of his time to the composition of instrumental and choral music in a quasi-Romantic vein which has largely been performed only in France, Russia and Japan."

        "content": "Jos Van Immerseel (born 9 November 1945) is a Belgian harpsichordist, pianist and conductor.\nVan Immerseel studied organ, piano and harpsichord at the Antwerp Conservatory under Flor Peeters, Eug\u00e8ne Traey and harpsichordist and musicologist Kenneth Gilbert. He created the Collegium Musicum there, developing his interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, later expanding his activities to include the Classical and early Romantic eras. He is now in demand as a fortepianist in concert halls across Europe, where he is known for his refined sensitivity to the rhetorical aspects of music and for his skills in improvisation. (His cadenzas were singled out in reviews of his Beethoven concerto recordings.) Over the years, he has acquired a unique collection of period keyboard instruments, which travel with him for concerts and CD recordings.\nIn 1977, he attracted international attention when he conducted Monteverdi's L'Orfeo in the former Royal Flemish Opera House in Antwerp. This series of 18 performances established a new standard which remains to this day.\nFrom 1980 to 1985, he was the artistic director of the Sweelinck Conservatory of Amsterdam.\nIn 1987 Van Immerseel established the \"period instrument\" ensemble Anima Eterna, which he continues to lead. This ensemble has become well-known and achieved a world-wide reputation particularly for the CD series of Mozart's complete piano concerti (with van Immerseel as soloist and conductor).\nDuring 1999 they toured Europe with performances of Beethoven symphonies.\nIn addition to his concertising, Van Immerseel is professor at the Antwerp Conservatory, where he uses historical instruments from the nearby Vleeshuis Museum to give masterclasses. He has also taught at the Sweelinck Conservatorium in Amsterdam and the Conservatoire National Sup\u00e9rieur in Paris, as well as given masterclasses at festivals in La Roque-d'Anth\u00e9ron, Utrecht, Sopron and Ancona.\nVan Immerseel appears on Sony Classical's Vivarte imprint as a solo performer, as a soloist with Tafelmusik and as a participant in chamber music. Among his partners were: Midori Seiler (violin), Claire Chevallier (piano duo), Lisa Shklyaver (clarinet), Thomas Bauer (baritone), Yeree Suh (soprano), and Chouchane Siranossian (violin).\nSince winning first prize at the inaugural Paris International Harpsichord Competition in 1973, Jos Van Immerseel has established an international career as a fortepianist and conductor specializing in music of the Baroque and Classical eras. Accomplished on the organ and piano as well as harpsichord and fortepiano, Van Immerseel has in particular gained a reputation for his performances of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert on Sony Classical. Most recently he has appeared on Vivarte with Anner Bylsma in performances of Beethoven's complete cello sonatas (S2K 60761) and with L'Archibudelli in performances of Schubert's \"Trout\" Quintet and \"Arpeggione\" Sonata (SK 63361). His recent cycle of Beethoven Piano concertos with Tafelmusik and Bruno Weil (Nos. 1 and 2: SK 68250; Nos. 3 and 4: SK 62824; No. 5: SK 63365) elicited praise for his stylistic sensitivity and his musical sensibility. His recording of Mozart's late piano works, Mozart: The Vienna Years (S2K 62879), prompted Classic CD to write that Van Immerseel is \"among the most winning and authoritative champions of the fortepiano\".\nSince 2002 he has been artistic director of the Collection Anima Eterna for the Parisian label Zig-Zag Territories.\nIn 2010, the city of Bremen awarded him the Prize of the Musikfest Bremen for his career."

Thomas' most successful electronic music works include \"A Calling Around The World\", \"Total Controller\", \"High Time\", \"Colorcode\", \"All We Need For Christmas\", \"She'll Do What She Wants\", \"Trapped\", \"This Time I Feel It\", and \"Yesterday's Dream\".Vancouver radio station Z95.3FM originally discovered Thomas Donovan and play-listed 10 of his songs over a 5-year span (from 1992 to 1997). Other initial supporters included Vancouver's LG73 radio and Seattle's dance station C89.5FM. Top-40 radio support in both Vancouver and Seattle became a spring board for Thomas' dance music to jump to other stations and club circuits across the U.S., Canada and abroad.Thomas mixes human rights and global activism lyrics in his exploration of synth-pop music. Thomas' release  \"Calling Around the World\" is a visual and lyrical call to action, inspired by concern for environmental issues and the greater human condition. Thomas directed, edited and produced the first history documentary of Vancouver's LGBT community. Thomas' support for human rights and same sex marriage is reflected in his musical and video works, as demonstrated in his sexually and politically charged dance-pop dynamo titled \"What Our Love Is Made Of\".\"He had a big hit in the '90s with \"Total Controller\" and Thomas Donovan is still playing in the same electronica pop/dance sandbox. The biggest hook on a pretty hooky song is that insistent beat holding all the swirly stuff together, kinda disco with computers. \" \u2013 John P. McLaughlin \u2013 Vancouver Province Newspaper"

On their return, Thank You supported Joe Brown's Browns Home Brew and Marmalade on UK tours, as well as playing leading university and college dates. His aggressive, abrupt rock guitar style was first captured on recordings made by Joe Brown at his Essex recording studio. These were never released due to apparent difficulties in finding a vocal style from the band's two singers.\nJapp had, however, made a strong impression on Marmalade and was invited to join the group to replace Hugh Nicolson. He toured extensively with the band but no recordings made during his tenure achieved chart status.\nHe also wrote/co-wrote songs for such artists as Paul Stanley, Kiss and The Babys, and worked with other musicians such as Matthew Fisher and John Waite.As a solo artist, he released an album in 2000 titled Dreamer. Japp's style transitioned from rock to blues guitar. A number of videos featuring the musician have been posted on the Internet."

He entered the cinema industry \"at the very start of Bolivian fiction film production\".\nHis first film, The Prophecy of the Lake (La profec\u00eda del lago), was made in 1925, on the heels of Bolivia's  first ever fiction feature, Pedro Sambarino's Coraz\u00f3n Aymara (1925). The Prophecy of the Lake was a contemporary love story between an Aymara man and the daughter of a white landowner. The film was censored, for its \"social critique\" and \"because it featured the love between a native man and a white woman\", and was never shown. Velasco Maidana subsequently started his own production company, Urania. His next two films, Wara Wara (1930) and Hacia la Gloria (1931) were released in cinema as feature films, and Wara Wara remains \"the only known surviving work from Bolivia's silent-film era\". He also made short documentary films, \"before returning to music\".From then on, he worked exclusively on music, and also left Bolivia to work abroad. Among his notable ballets is Amerindia (1940).Maidana was introduced to Dorothy Hood in Mexico. He married Hood in 1946 and during that time, they traveled, following his conducting jobs which took them between Mexico City, New York and Houston, Texas.In the 1960s, Maidana had to quit conducting because he was showing signs of Parkinson's disease. He and Hood moved to Houston for better medical care. He died in Houston in 1989."

Yeats starting in 1934. Their correspondence was published as Ah, Sweet Dancer (1970).\nYeats edited her poems for publication, but it is not clear how much change he made to them. He included some of them in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, which he edited.\nSome of her poems have been set as songs by the composer Robert Erickson.\nShe was married twice: first to John Collis, with whom she had a son, Michael, and secondly to Raymond Lovell, with whom she had a daughter, Simone Lovell. She died in 1951, when she was 44.\nDuring her marriage to Raymond Lovell she had an affair with Yeats. When they met in 1934, Yeats was 69 and Ruddock`was 27.  Their affair was conducted fitfully over the next few years. The affair broke down and Ruddock became mentally unstable. Some months later she followed Yeats (uninvited) out to the island of Majorca, where he was working with the Indian monk Shri Purohit Swami. Ruddock ended up in an asylum in Madrid from where she was rescued by Yeats and his friends, but later died in another institution, St. Ebba's Hospital in Epsom. Yeats' poem \"A Crazed Girl\" is believed to be inspired by Ruddock.\n\n\n== References =="

He also performed with the band on their North American tour later that year. Ralf left the band shortly afterwards following the birth of his son Julian Wadephul. The 2006 Tangerine Dream release \"Blue Dawn\" consists of material composed by Froese and Wadephul during that same tour in 1988, albeit of a studio nature.  Ralf continues to keep busy as a musician and sound engineer to this day.\nIn April 2008, he released his first ever solo album entitled \"When Aliens Meet a Drop of Water\" on the German Manikin Records label."

He is a great grandson of D. S. Senanayake (Sri Lanka's \"Father of the Nation\") and cousin of Ruwan Wijewardene.Senanayake was appointed State Minister of Foreign Affairs in the United National Party led national government on May 31, 2017. He was the State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management from 2015 to 2017. He was the Deputy Minister of Tourism and Sports in the United National Party 100 days government. Senanayake served as acting Foreign Minister when the Minister Ravi Karunanayake resigned on 10 August 2017. Vasantha Senanayake as state minister foreign affairs developed a close friendship with Lord Naseby of the UK House of Lords and supported vociferously the English Peer's condemnation of the characterization of the war and the Sri Lankan military.During the 2018 Sri Lanka constitutional crisis, Senanayake, a Member of Parliament elected on the United National Party's Polonnaruwa District ticket in 2015, switched his alliance on multiple occasions between the two political parties that were battling for power. Initially he pledged his support for Mahinda Rajapaksa who appointed him as Minister of Tourism and Wildlife after controversially dismissing prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Senanayake then returned his alliance to the United National Party, announcing his resignation from his ministerial portfolio, but later supported Rajapaksa again. This turbulence which Senanayake faced in his second term in Parliament moving between the UNP, the party of his ancestors and the Rajapakse camp may be attributed to his dilemma. Which can be attributed to him of wanting to belong to the \u2018Old UNP\u2019 but fiercely attempting to resist and depose its present occupant and leader of four decades Ranil Wickremasinghe. Wickremasinghe remains in office today after leading the UNP to its worst ever defeat in which the party secured no elected seats and Wickremasinghe scrambled in on a single National List seat the party had secured. He went on to be appointed president of Sri Lanka following the peoples uprising and Gotabhaya Rajapaksha\u2019s resignation in 2022.Senanayake suggested early in his parliamentary career that the imposition of an overly powerful executive presidency on a Westminster type parliament was likely to cause repercussions in Parliament's role, human rights and national policy and rule of law. He submitted a model constitution for the reflections of the select committee. In parliament he has been an active lobbyist against the alcohol and tobacco industries. He has been espousing the importance of transforming modern sri lanka in to a commercial trading hub giving emphasis to sri lanka\u2019s geographical position. Senanayake also established strong contacts with many countries and world leaders during his tenure in the foreign ministry.Senanayake did not contest for election in 2020, and has been spending much of his time writing. His first published book 'Transcending Sita' has been well received."

His father Frank, who was a founder-member of Fianna F\u00e1il, and his mother Delia Costello, both died in 1931. As a result, he was raised by an uncle and aunt. His brother Fergus (Patrick) Barrett OFM, became a Franciscan priest, and founding rector of St John Vianney Seminary, Pretoria, South Africa. Barrett was educated at Ballyea National School and St Flannan's College in Ennis. He studied engineering at University College Galway, though did not complete his studies. He was a cadet in the Irish Army and later worked as a rate collector and an auctioneer.He was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 14 March 1968 at the by-election in the Clare constituency, held following the death of Fine Gael TD William Murphy.

Another cousin, Denis-Benjamin Viger, was also involved in the Patriote movement, and later served as joint premier of the Province of Canada.\nUnlike his brother and cousins, Papineau was not politically active during the lead-up to the Rebellion.  It was not until 1842 that he entered politics, when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in a by-election, as the member for Ottawa County, Canada East. Two years later, in 1844, Viger invited Papineau to join his new government.  Papineau became the Commissioner of Crown Lands with a seat in the Executive Council. When Viger withdrew from politics in 1846, Papineau succeeded him as joint premier from Canada East. Papineau in turn retired from politics late in 1847.\nPrior to his political career, Papineau was involved in various commercial activities. He was the manager of the family seigneury of Petite-Nation, first for his father, then for his brother Louis-Joseph. He also had a share in a bookstore in Montreal, and some commercial activities in the Petit-Nation area. He was the postmaster for Petit-Nation, and had several term appointments as a justice of the peace in the Montreal district. \nAfter withdrawing from politics, Papineau retired to Petite-Nation, where he died in 1854."

He is most notable as a constant attendant at the court of Peter III and Alfonso III of Aragon. He may be the same person as the Peironet who composed poems with Peter III.\nSalvatge wrote the third piece in a five-piece cycle of sirventes written in Summer 1285. Early in the summer Bernart d'Auriac inaugurated the political debate by coming to the defence of the \"three kings\" Philip III of France, Philip of Navarre, and Charles of Valois, who claimed the Crown of Aragon. Under the direction of the French king they invaded Catalonia in the so-called \"Aragonese Crusade\". After Peter III of Aragon responded to Bernart, Pere responded to Peter in the short piece Senher, reys qu'enamoratz par.\nPere appears to have gotten his nickname from his occupation as a caballero salvaje or cavaller salvatge in the king's house. As such, he acted as messenger and herald. Among his duties was directing the battle cry when the king's armies went to war. Pere is first mentioned by name in 1280 as a juglar del rey (\"jongleur of the king\"). In April 1286 he was charged with distributing compensation in precious metal and money to the other jongleurs who had assisted in Peter's coronation (in 1276). He was still alive in June 1287 when Alfonso III ordered proceedings against some men accused of kidnapping Pere's daughter."

He was baptised on 15 September 1594. He was awarded BA from Magdalen Hall, Oxford on 6 July 1614. He entered Middle Temple on 1 July 1615 and was called to the bar on 23 May 1623.  He was Lord of the Manor of Baunton and a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Gloucestershire.In 1626 George was elected Member of Parliament for Cirencester, and was re-elected in 1628 until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, he was re-elected MP for Cirencester in the Short Parliament and in November 1640 he was re-elected for the Long Parliament.  In August 1642, he formed a garrison for Parliament at Cirencester, but was captured by Prince Rupert in the spring of 1643 and taken to Oxford. The Earl of Forth threatened to execute George if Colonel Fiennes, the parliamentary governor of Bristol, executed his prisoners. Although Fiennes did put his prisoners to death, the Earl of Forth relented and spared George. George thereupon changed his views and supported the king. He was accordingly disabled from sitting in parliament and retired to his estates. He became a bencher of his inn in November 1653 and Treasurer in November 1658.After the Restoration, George was re-elected MP for Cirencester in 1661 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death.George probably died in December 1678 aged 85 and was buried at Baunton on 6 January 1679.George married Elizabeth Tirrell, daughter of John Tirrell of St Ives, Huntingdonshire and had five sons and a daughter.\n\n\n== References =="

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1936.Muirhead was born in Clinton, Ontario and was educated at public schools.  He worked as a farmer, and served as a school trustee and municipal assessor. In 1906, Muirhead married Lucy E. Dunfield.He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM), defeating Conservative incumbent Reuben Waugh by 137 votes in the Norfolk constituency.  The UFM unexpectedly won a majority of seats in this election, and formed government as the Progressive Party.  Muirhead served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's government throughout his time in the legislature.\nHe was returned in the 1927 election, defeating Waugh by thirty-four votes in a rematch from the 1922 contest.  He defeated Waugh a third time in the 1932 election, by 236 votes.\nHe was defeated in the 1936 election, losing to Conservative John Lawrie by eighty-two votes.  He sought a return to the legislature in the 1941 election, but lost to Lawrie by forty-four votes.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Erwin Joseph Saxl (May 7, 1904 \u2013 January 28, 1981) was a physicist and inventor.  He was born in Vienna in 1904 and received his Ph.D. there in 1927.  In the late 1920s he emigrated to the United States.  In 1935 he founded the Saxl Instrument Company, which designed and manufactured tension meters for use in the textile industry, and later in other industries.  The company, which Saxl ran jointly with his wife, Lucretia Hildreth Saxl, from their home in Harvard, Massachusetts, was renamed Tensitron in 1953.  Saxl is reported as having stated that he worked under Albert Einstein.  He died in 1981.Saxl is most well known for a series of controversial experiments in which he measured unexpected changes in the period of a torsion pendulum under various conditions.  In one series of experiments, the period of a torsion pendulum situated inside a Faraday cage, with the pendulum and the cage connected by a conducting path, was observed to increase as the voltage on the cage was increased.  In another experiment, the period of the pendulum was seen to increase during an eclipse.  Saxl is reported to have attempted, without success, to get this work published in the Physical Review; eventually the work was published in Nature.In the early 1960s, Saxl began a collaboration with Mildred Allen of Mount Holyoke College.  In 1971,  Saxl and Allen published a report of  anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during a solar eclipse in 1970 and hypothesized that \u201cgravitational theory needs to be modified\u201d.  In addition, they observed unexplained diurnal variation in the period of the pendulum.  None of the effects observed by Saxl and Allen have obvious explanations in terms of well-established theories of gravity and electromagnetism.  Although more subtle explanations, still using conventional physical theory, have been proffered there does not appear to be general agreement as to the cause of the anomalies.  Saxl and Allen's claim that general relativity must be modified, and earlier claims of a similar nature by Allais based on observations of anomalies in the behaviour of a paraconical pendulum, have not won acceptance by the physics community, and recent attempts to reproduce the phenomena have not been successful."

Her image famously appears in Novalis\u2019 Hymns to the Night, a foundational text of the literary movement known as German Romanticism.\nAlthough Novalis's love for Sophie has assumed mythic proportions, their time together was short and uneventful. The two met on 17 November 1794 when Novalis was twenty-two and Sophie was only twelve. They became engaged on Sophie's thirteenth birthday 17 March 1795. Sophie became sick in November 1795, and her sickness continued until her death at the age of 15 in March 1797. The loss of Sophie brought about a deep period of mourning and suffering in Novalis' life. Even so, he became engaged to Julie von Charpentier in December 1798.\nThe depth of Sophie's love for Novalis is uncertain given her young age. Some of her diary entries, found in Wm. O\u2019Brien's Novalis: Signs of Revolution, provide some insight into her relationship with Novalis:\n\n1 March.  Today Hartenberch visited again nothing happened.\n11 March. We were alone today and nothing at all happened.\n12 March. Today was like yesterday nothing at all happened.\n13 March. Today was repentance day and Hartenb. was here.\n14 March. Today Hartenber. was still here he got a letter from his brother.Sophie had a sister, Caroline von K\u00fchn, and a stepsister, Wilhelmine von Th\u00fcmmel.\nLudwig Tieck's biography of Novalis describes Sophie, saying: \"Even as a child, she gave an impression which--because it was so gracious and spiritually lovely--we must call superearthly or heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into an actual reality.\" von K\u00fchn and Novalis' relationship is the focus of the 1995 novel The Blue Flower by Penelope Fitzgerald."

He got nominated for the prestigious Buddingh prize for the book, but staged a Laibach-esque performance on the awards, where Bart van der Pligt read an Anti-Price poem and Samuel Vriezen wearing a fake moustache yelled the prize had to be taken seriously from within the audience. Benders sang 'Lezen is Lezen' ('Reading is reading') from a dark corner, to the tune of the known 'Life is Life' song of the Austrian band Opus.In 2011 Benders sabotaged the National Turing Poetry contest by simultaneously sending in poems that ended in the top 100, sending in a song about Jury Member Gerrit Komrij Kom nou Mr Komrij (based on Frankly Mr Shankly of the Smiths) and making an alternate character named 'Bert' that severely criticized the quality of the top 100. Ramsey Nasr, the National Poet, gave a raving speech against 'Bert' at the nominations Gala day, not knowing it was Benders, and claimed Bert was just jealous for not making it into the Top 100.\nAfter this successful action Benders vowed to stop this particular artform. He left his publisher and self-published a second volume of poetry named 'Wat koop ik voor jouw donkerwilde machten, Willem' ('What do I buy for your darkwilde powers, William') with 91 poems, which got raving reviews on major poetry sites but was ignored by the poetry magazine establishment.\nIn February 2013 Benders, as a situationist artwork, put a Bill Knott poem into the Turing National Poetry contest. Benders was present with 2 poems in the Top 20, but sent the Sesame Street character 'Bert' to collect the nomination. The jury took several ressentimental jibes at Bert, which he recorded and remixed into a video named '36 Euro'.\nMuch of Benders\u2019 work combines not only literary styles, such as lyrical, conceptual, satirical, and absurdist influences; his work also moves across genres, media and modes. Some examples are: his Laibach-inspired performance at a poetry award including an Anti-Prize poem and choreographed chants from within the audience, and a fake moustache; several submissions to poetry contests intended as playful self-referential critique of poetry institutions and contests as such; W\u00f4ld, W\u00f4ld, W\u00f4ld! (2013) a personalized poetry book, including dedications and assignments to the reader, poems in Dutch and English, concrete poems, images. Stubbing Out a Cigarette on a Nightingale will be Benders\u2019 first English language poetry collection. In 2014, Dutch publisher van Gennep has republished some of Benders\u2019 works that had only been available as self-published prints.\nBenders published five books with van Gennep but in 2019 after a discussion with Ruud Poppelaars and Monique van der Kubbe he decided to get involved in the new publishing house De Kaneelfabriek, a name loosely based on a novel by Bruno Schulz. He has since published Baah Baaah Krakschaap/ De P van Winterslaap there, a counterprinted experimental volume of poetry that managed to sell out two prints, unique for such experimental poetry.\nIn 2020/2021 Benders published a Gaelic-based collection of 'magical poetry' Ginneninne that infused the Dutch language with Gaelic and Irish-based neologisms. He subsequently mailed the book to critics with a tab of 1cp-LSD inside, since critic Piet Gerbrandy in his review of Baah Baaah Krakschaap had written that 'sober analysis does not yield too much result'."

He is most notable for his studies of radiant heat. He was one of the six founding members of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft at Berlin on 14 January 1845.\nKnoblauch's father was a well-to-do silk fabrics manufacturer in Berlin. Despite pressure from his father to enter the family business, Knoblauch in his early 20s opted to study mathematics and science at the University of Berlin. There he became one of the star students in the laboratory of Gustav Magnus. Knoblauch's doctorate, completed in Berlin in 1847, described valuable experiments that established some of the optical properties of radiant heat (a.k.a. infrared radiation). In an article describing these experiments Knoblauch wrote that experimental facts are \"the only permanent things in science\", while abstract models are \"transitory\" and should be treated with caution and kept separate from the facts, a view that Magnus maintained also.\nAs a researcher and teacher at the University of Marburg, 1849\u201353, he produced valuable experimental demonstrations about the nature of diamagnetism. Knoblauch's student and collaborator on the diamagnetism work was John Tyndall. Tyndall and Knoblauch maintained a correspondence on and off over the next 25 years.Knoblauch moved to the University of Halle in 1853, and remained there for the rest of his career. During his first few years at Halle he did not publish anything. Later his publications were still not as frequent as they had been before moving to Halle. In his Halle years, apart from science teaching and research, he also gave his time to various administrative functions in German science including being president for 17 years of the German Academy of Sciences. He was also the rector (chief administrative officer) of the University of Halle for a while.\nHis wife Elisabeth (1827\u20131855) died on September 12 due to complications from childbirth of their son Johannes, who was born on August 27."

At the same time, in an unofficial capacity Starr became involved in the conditioning of horses. As an unlicensed trainer his first win in 1936 was not formally recognized as were the wins of other horses he trained between then and 1952 when he applied for his license.\nYonnie Starr earned his first Canadian Horse of the Year honors in 1955 with Ace Marine, a colt whose wins included the three races that four years later were officially designated as the Canadian Triple Crown series. In all, Starr won ten official Triple Crown Classics including four Queen's Plates. His horses earned ten Sovereign Awards and won a record seven Canadian Horse of the Year titles: Ace Marine (1955), Wonder Where (1959), Fanfreluche (1970), La Prevoyante (1972), L'Enjoleur (1974, 1975), L'Alezane (1977). Seven of the horses he trained were inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame with one of them also elected to the U.S. United States Racing Hall of Fame.Although Starr trained horses of both sexes, he was recognized as someone who also had a special talent to develop fillies. During his career he trained horses with great success for prominent owners such as Conn Smythe and Larkin Maloney, both individually and for the Smythe/Maloney racing partnership. In the 1970s and 1980s Starr continued as a dominant force in Canadian racing as the trainer for Quebec sportsman, Jean-Louis Levesque. In addition to training for others, he owned a few horses and notably trained Unbranded who won the 1954 Jockey Club Cup Handicap.\nYonnie Starr trained horses until his death in Florida in March 1990 at age eighty-four. At the time, he had been racing for the winter season at Gulfstream Park.\n\n\n== References =="

She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She overthrew her husband, becoming a \"femme fatale\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure.\nIsabella arrived in England at age 12 during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser, and by 1325, her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her young son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the war with Scotland.\nIn 1330, aged 18, Isabella's son, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority. Mortimer was executed, Isabella's regency was ended and she was imprisoned, but soon released.  She lived out her remaining years as a wealthy courtier and grew close again to her family especially her daughter Joan, Queen of Scots and her grandson  Edward, Prince of Wales."

His filmmaking was particularly influential, with critic Georges Sadoul considering him \"one of the three major postwar Greek directors\" (along with Michael Cacoyannis and Nikos Koundouros).Tzavellas wrote at least 26 plays, in addition to writing the scripts for all of his films. Among his notable films are  Marinos Kontaras (1948), the drama O methystakas (1950), and Antigone (1961), a cinematic adaptation of the Sophocles tragedy. His adaptation of Antigone reimagined it in the language of realist cinema, omitting stylized elements of Greek stageplay such as the chorus, and attempting to convey the same information via setting and dialogue. In 1964 he was a member of the jury at the 14th Berlin International Film Festival.  His masterpiece, however, is the 1955 film The Counterfeit Coin (I k\u00e1lpiki l\u00edra), a film in four parts, linking the stories of several people through their transactions of a single counterfeit gold coin."

Between 1913 and 1920 William (Bill) worked as a reporter for a Reading, Pennsylvania newspaper.  He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1920 and started work for William Randolph Hearst's International News Service (INS).  As an INS reporter, he covered the John T. Scopes trial, also known as the  Scopes Trial, in Dayton, Tennessee and on July 24, 1925 he was the first reporter to file the dispatch stating the outcome.  A conversation that occurred during the last days of the trial, Scopes said:\n\"There's something I must tell you. It's worried me. I didn't violate the law ...I never taught that evolution lesson. I skipped it. I was doing something else the day I should have taught it, and I missed the whole lesson about Darwin and never did teach it. Those kids they put on the stand couldn't remember what I taught them three months ago. They were coached by the lawyers.\" \"Honest, I've been scared all through the trial that the kids might remember I missed the lesson. I was afraid they'd get on the stand and say I hadn't taught it and then the whole trial would go blooey. If that happened they would run me out of town on a rail.\"When Bill mentioned that would make a great news story, John responded, \"My god no! Not a word of it until the Supreme Court passes my appeal. My lawyers would kill me.\"  In L. Sprague de Camp's book, The Great Monkey Trial, de Camp goes on to say that Bill claimed he overheard Clarence Darrow coaching the students on what to say, however, even with coaching, only one of the students implied that Scopes taught evolution.Bill also covered the national political conventions and events in the Capitol.  In 1939 he was the Bureau Chief of the International News Service in Washington, D.C.  In late 1949, during a game of hearts, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Bill came up with the idea for a list of names, photographs, and descriptions of the ten worst criminals wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  On March 14, 1950, the list was compiled and distributed as the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list.Following his transatlantic solo flight and return to the United States in 1927, Charles Lindbergh gave his flight jacket to Bill.  He wore this jacket on many outings and kept it until his death.  The jacket was then willed to his brother Herb.  By the time of Herb's death in 1986,  the jacket had so deteriorated that it was mistakenly thrown out by someone who did not realize its historic value.Bill was a member of the bar in the District of Columbia and wrote two books, Life and Works of William E. Borah and Ten Days that Changed the World, the latter being an account of the ten days between the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the surrender of Japan. For many years he was owner and the Vice President of the Washington Redskins football team.  A World War I veteran, Bill received numerous awards from the Air Force, Army, and Navy for patriotic service.Bill was the president of the Senate Press Gallery for over 20 years.  As a token of appreciation for Bill's aid in having the Congressional press galleries renovated, the standing committee of House and Senate correspondents today presented a silver punch bowl to William K. Hutchinson of International News Service. In the photo, taken at the Capitol on 25-FEB-1938, Hutchinson is shown receiving the bowl from Nathan Robertson (right) of King Features who is Chairman of the committee.He died the day after the announcement of the merger of the International News Service with the United Press to form United Press International.  On May 26, 1958 the funeral was held with Vice President Richard Nixon as one of the pallbearers.  Bill was awarded the lifetime District of Columbia license plate number \"53\" which upon his death in 1958, was willed to John Willard Marriott.\n\n\n== References =="

He also published under the pseudonym Rusmir.\nHe was born as Franc Albrecht in the Upper Carniolan town of Kamnik in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He grew up in a liberal milieu, but he later came closer to more leftist views. He studied at the University of Vienna and became a literary critic and a neo-romantic poet.\nFrom the 1922 till the 1932 Albreht was editor of the liberal literary magazine Ljubljanski zvon. After the crisis of the journal in 1932, which emerged from different interpretations of Slovene identity and attitudes towards the centralist policies in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Albreht left the journal and established, together with the literary critic Josip Vidmar and author Ferdo Kozak, a new magazine called Sodobnost (\"Modernity\"). Under Albreht, Vidmar and Kozak, the new magazine became the foremost progressive journal in Slovenia, in which also many Marxists and Communists could publish their articles under pseudonyms.\n\nAfter the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Albreht became an active member of the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People in Ljubljana. He was imprisoned by Italian fascist authorities on a number of occasions. In 1944, the Nazis sent him to Dachau concentration camp.Soon after the liberation from Nazi occupation and the establishment of the Communist regime in Yugoslavia in 1945, he was appointed mayor of Ljubljana. He served in that office between 1945 and 1948. In 1948, he was dismissed and shortly imprisoned under the suspicion of anti-Communist activity.\nHe was married to the poet Vera Albreht. He died in Ljubljana in 1963 and is buried in the \u017dale city cemetery."

        "content": "Edward Gough Whitlam  (11 July 1916 \u2013 21 October 2014) was the 21st prime minister of Australia, serving from 1972 to 1975. He held office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), of which he was the longest-serving. He was notable for being the head of a reformist and socially progressive administration that ended with his removal as prime minister after controversially being dismissed by the governor-general of Australia, Sir John Kerr, at the climax of the 1975 constitutional crisis. Whitlam is the only Australian prime minister to have been removed from office by the governor-general.\nWhitlam was an air navigator in the Royal Australian Air Force for four years during World War II, and worked as a barrister following the war. He was first elected to the Australian House of Representatives in 1952, becoming a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Werriwa. Whitlam became deputy leader of the Labor Party in 1960, and in 1967, after the retirement of Arthur Calwell, was elected leader of the party and became the Leader of the Opposition. After narrowly losing the 1969 federal election to John Gorton, Whitlam  led Labor to victory at the 1972 election, after 23 years of continuous Coalition government.\nIn its first term, the Whitlam government introduced numerous socially progressive and reformist policies and initiatives, including the termination of military conscription and the end of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, institution of universal health care and free university education, and the implementation of legal aid programmes. With the opposition-controlled Australian Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a snap double dissolution election in May 1974 in which he won a slightly reduced majority in the House of Representatives, and picked up three Senate seats to hold equal Senate numbers to the opposition. The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only joint sitting enabled under section 57 of the Australian constitution as part of the double dissolution process. His government's second term was dominated by a declining economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1970s global recession, as well as a political scandal known as the Loans affair, which led to the removal of two government ministers. The opposition continued to obstruct Whitlam's agenda in the Senate.\nIn late 1975, the opposition senators refused to allow a vote on the government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. Whitlam refused to agree to the request, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended in mid-November, when governor-general Sir John Kerr dismissed him from office and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as caretaker prime minister. Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide. Whitlam stepped down as leader of the party after losing again at the 1977 election, and retired from parliament the following year. Upon the election of the Hawke government in 1983, he was appointed as Ambassador to UNESCO, a position he filled with distinction, and was elected a member of the UNESCO Executive Board. He remained active into his nineties. The propriety and circumstances of his dismissal and the legacy of his government have been frequently debated in the decades since he left office. Whitlam is often ranked in the upper-tier of Australian prime ministers by political experts and academics, with political journalist Paul Kelly writing in 1994 that \"there is no doubt that in three years his government was responsible for more reforms and innovations than any other government in Australian history\"."
