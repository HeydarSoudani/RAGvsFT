        "content": "The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team debuted in The Fantastic Four #1 (cover dated Nov. 1961), helping usher in a new level of realism in the medium. It was the first superhero team created by artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby and editor/co-plotter Stan Lee, who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title. The four characters traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four, who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to outer space, are: Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group, who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes; the Invisible Woman (Susan \"Sue\" Storm), who eventually married Reed, who can render herself invisible and project powerful invisible force fields and blasts; the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them and fly; and the monstrous Thing (Ben Grimm), their grumpy but benevolent friend, a former college football star, Reed's college roommate and a good pilot, who possesses tremendous superhuman strength, durability and endurance due to his stone-like flesh. Since the 1961 introduction, the Fantastic Four has been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional, yet loving, family. Breaking convention with other comic archetypes, the members squabbled, held grudges both deep and petty, and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. They are also well known for their recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch Doctor Doom; the planet-devouring Galactus; the Kree Empire's ruthless and tyrannical enforcer Ronan the Accuser; the Negative Zone's ruler Annihilus; the sea-dwelling prince Namor; the spacefaring Silver Surfer; and the Skrull warrior Kl'rt. The Fantastic Four have been adapted into other media, including four animated series and four live-action films."

        "content": "The Gospel according to Luke (), also called the Gospel of Luke or simply Luke, tells of the origins, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ. Together with the Acts of the Apostles, it makes up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke\u2013Acts, accounting for 27.5% of the New Testament. The combined work divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with the gospel making up the first two of these \u2013 the life of Jesus the Messiah from his birth to the beginning of his mission in the meeting with John the Baptist, followed by his ministry with events such as the Sermon on the Plain and its Beatitudes, and his Passion, death, and resurrection. Most modern scholars agree that the main sources used for Luke were (a) the Gospel of Mark, (b) a hypothetical sayings collection called the Q source, and (c) material found in no other gospels, often referred to as the L (for Luke) source. The author is anonymous; the traditional view that it was Luke the Evangelist, the companion of Paul, is still occasionally put forward, but the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters. The most probable date for its composition is around AD 80\u2013110, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century."

        "content": "\"The Hound of Heaven\" is a 182-line poem written by English poet Francis Thompson (1859\u20131907). The poem became famous and was the source of much of Thompson's posthumous reputation. The poem was first published in Thompson's first volume of poems in 1893. It was included in the Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse (1917). Thompson's work was praised by G. K. Chesterton, and it was also an influence on J. R. R. Tolkien, who presented a paper on Thompson in 1914. The Jesuit J.F.X. O'Conor remarks of the Christian themes of the poem that, \"The name is strange. It startles one at first. It is so bold, so new, so fearless. It does not attract, rather the reverse. But when one reads the poem this strangeness disappears. The meaning is understood. As the hound follows the hare, never ceasing in its running, ever drawing nearer in the chase, with unhurrying and imperturbed pace, so does God follow the fleeing soul by His Divine grace. And though in sin or in human love, away from God it seeks to hide itself, Divine grace follows after, unwearyingly follows ever after, till the soul feels its pressure forcing it to turn to Him alone in that never ending pursuit.\""

        "title": "Watchmen_Summary",
        "content": "Watchmen is an American comic book maxiseries by the British creative team of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins. It was published monthly by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 before being collected in a single-volume edition in 1987. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead. Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and satirize the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history in which superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement. Creatively, the focus of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, which one of the characters reads. Structured at times as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence and repeated imagery. A commercial success, Watchmen has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. Watchmen was recognized in Times List of the 100 Best Novels as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the BBC's Nicholas Barber described it as \"the moment comic books grew up\". After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, director Zack Snyder's Watchmen was released in 2009. A video game series, Watchmen: The End Is Nigh, was released in the same year to coincide with the film's release. DC Comics published Before Watchmen, a series of nine prequel miniseries, in 2012, and Doomsday Clock, a 12-issue limited series and sequel to the original Watchmen series, from 2017 to 2019 \u2013 both without Moore's or Gibbons' involvement. The second series integrated the Watchmen characters within the DC Universe, home to more recognizable DC superheroes like Superman and Batman. A television continuation to the original comic, set 34 years after the comic's timeline, was broadcast on HBO from October to December 2019 with Gibbons' involvement. A comic continuation of the HBO series, titled Rorschach and written by Tom King, began publication in October 2020. Moore has expressed his displeasure with later adaptations and asked that Watchmen not be adapted for future works."

        "content": "Titus Andronicus is a tragedy by William Shakespeare believed to have been written between 1588 and 1593, probably in collaboration with George Peele. It is thought to be Shakespeare's first tragedy and is often seen as his attempt to emulate the violent and bloody revenge plays of his contemporaries, which were extremely popular with audiences throughout the 16th century. Titus, a general in the Roman army, presents Tamora, Queen of the Goths, as a slave to the new Roman emperor, Saturninus. Saturninus takes her as his wife. From this position Tamora vows revenge against Titus for killing her son. Titus and his family retaliate. Titus Andronicus was initially very popular, but by the later 17th century it was not well esteemed. The Victorian era disapproved of it largely because of its graphic violence. Its reputation began to improve around the middle of the 20th century, but it is still one of Shakespeare's least respected plays."

        "content": "The Count of Monte Cristo () is an adventure novel  written by French author Alexandre Dumas (p\u00e8re) completed in 1844. It is one of the author's more popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet. The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815\u20131839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins on the day that Napoleon left his first island of exile, Elba, beginning the Hundred Days period when Napoleon returned to power. The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story centrally concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centers on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. Before he can marry his fianc\u00e9e Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, Edmond Dant\u00e8s, a nineteen-year-old Frenchman, and first mate of the Pharaon, is falsely accused of treason, arrested, and imprisoned without trial in the Ch\u00e2teau d'If, a grim island fortress off Marseille. A fellow prisoner, Abb\u00e9 Faria, correctly deduces that his jealous rival Fernand Mondego, envious crewmate Danglars, and double-dealing magistrate De Villefort turned him in. Faria inspires his escape and guides him to a fortune in treasure. As the powerful and mysterious Count of Monte Cristo (Italy), Dant\u00e8s arrives from the Orient to enter the fashionable Parisian world of the 1830s and avenge himself on the men who conspired to destroy him. The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Lucy Sante, \"The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.\""

        "content": "The Nun's Story is a 1956 novel by Kathryn Hulme. It was a Book of the Month selection and reached #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Hulme wrote the book based partly upon the experiences of her friend, Marie Louise Habets of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, a Belgian nurse and an ex-nun whom she met while working with refugees in post-war Europe. The author sponsored the former nun's immigration to the United States, and later converted to Catholicism. It often is stated erroneously that the book was based upon Hulme's experiences. The lead character of the book, Sister Luke (pre-convent name Gabrielle Van Der Mal), finds her faith tested in Africa where she finds herself at odds with headstrong Dr. Fortunati, operator of a remote hospital in the Belgian Congo, with whom she gradually builds respect, and again during World War II, when she is ordered not to take sides. Ultimately, Sister Luke is forced to decide whether to remain in the convent or return to the outside world. Gabrielle/Sister Luke is stretched between her desire to be faithful to the rule of her congregation and her desire to be a nurse. As a nun, she must remove all vestiges of \"Gabrielle Van Der Mal\" and sublimate herself into the devoted bride of Christ. As a nun, there is no room for her personal desires and aspirations. Ultimately, the conflict between her devotion to the Church and the nursing profession, juxtaposed with her passionate Belgian patriotism and her love of her father (killed by Nazi fighter planes while treating wounded) bring her to an impasse, which serves as the d\u00e9nouement of the novel."

        "content": "The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry is a 1973 book by Harold Bloom. It was the first in a series of books that advanced a new \"revisionary\" or antithetical approach to literary criticism. Bloom's central thesis is that poets are hindered in their creative process by the ambiguous relationship they necessarily maintain with precursor poets. While admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet, he argues that \"the poet in a poet\" is inspired to write by reading another poet's poetry and will tend to produce work that is in danger of being derivative of existing poetry, and, therefore, weak. Because poets historically emphasize an original poetic vision in order to guarantee their survival into posterity, the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets. Thus Bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of 'strong' poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence. Such an agon, Bloom argues, depends on six revisionary ratios, which reflect Freudian and quasi-Freudian defense mechanisms, as well as the tropes of classical rhetoric. Before writing this book, Bloom spent a decade studying the Romantic poets of the early nineteenth century. This is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of John Milton, Robert Browning, and Edmund Spenser. Other poets analyzed range from Lucretius and Dante to Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and John Ashbery. In The Anxiety of Influence and other early books, Bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post-enlightenment poets. Conversely, he suggested that influence might have been less of a problem for such poets as Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Bloom since has changed his mind, and the most recent editions of The Anxiety of Influence include a preface claiming that Shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of Christopher Marlowe. The book itself is divided into six major categories, called \"six revisionary ratios\" by Bloom.  They are clinamen, tessera, kenosis, daemonization, askesis, and apophrades."

It originated as an intermittent serial in Punch magazine in 1888\u201389 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The Diary records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son William Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months. Before their collaboration on the Diary, the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate. Although its initial public reception was muted, the Diary came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The Diary has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including Ken Russell's \"silent film\" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by Andrew Davies in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts."

        "content": "Dream of the Red Chamber (Honglou Meng) or The Story of the Stone (Shitou Ji) is a novel composed by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. One of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, it is known for its psychological scope, and its observation of the world view, aesthetics, life-styles, and social relations of 18th-century China. The intricate strands of its plot depict the rise and decline of a family much like Cao\u2019s own and, by extension, of the dynasty itself. Cao depicts the power of the father over the family, but the novel is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. At a more profound level, the author explores religious and philosophical questions, and the writing style includes echoes of the plays and novels of the late Ming, as well as poetry from earlier periods. Cao apparently began composing it in the 1740s and worked on it until his death in 1763 or 1764. Copies of his uncompleted manuscript circulated in Cao's social circle, under the title Story of a Stone in slightly varying versions of eighty chapters. It was not published until nearly three decades after Cao's death, when Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan (), edited the first and second printed editions under the title Dream of the Red Chamber in 1791\u201392, adding 40 chapters. It is still debated whether Gao and Cheng composed these chapters themselves and the extent to which they did or did not represent Cao's intentions. Their 120 chapter edition became the most widely circulated version. The title has also been translated as Red Chamber Dream and A Dream of Red Mansions. \"Redology\" is the field of study devoted to the novel."

It was intended to serve as a tool of state propaganda, emphasizing the basis of the Turkmen nation. The Ruhnama was introduced to Turkmen culture in a gradual but eventually pervasive way. Niyazov first placed copies in the nation's schools and libraries but eventually went as far as to make an exam on its teachings an element of the driving test. It was mandatory to read Ruhnama in schools, universities and governmental organisations. New governmental employees were tested on the book at job interviews. After the death of Niyazov in December 2006, its popularity remained high. However, in the following years, its ubiquity had waned as president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow removed it from the public school curriculum and halted the practice of testing university applicants on their knowledge of the book."

This novel, her eleventh, marked a clear departure from Glasgow's previous work\u2014she had written a series of bestsellers before publishing Virginia\u2014in that it attacked, in a subtle yet unmistakable way, the very layer of society that constituted her readership. Also, as its heroine, though virtuous and god-fearing, is denied the happiness she is craving, its plot did not live up to readers' expectations as far as poetic justice is concerned and was bound to upset some of them. Today, Virginia is seen by many as an outstanding achievement in Glasgow's career, exactly because the author defied literary convention by questioning the foundations of American society around the dawn of the 20th century, be it capitalism, religion or racism."

        "content": "The Hardy Boys, brothers Frank and Joe Hardy, are fictional characters who appear in several mystery series for children and teens. The series revolves around teenagers who are amateur sleuths, solving cases that stumped their adult counterparts. The characters were created by American writer Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of book-packaging firm Stratemeyer Syndicate. The books themselves were written by several ghostwriters, most notably Leslie McFarlane, under the collective pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. The Hardy Boys have evolved since their debut in 1927. From 1959 to 1973, the first 38 books were extensively revised, largely to remove depictions of racial stereotypes; they were also targeted towards younger readers by being rewritten in a simpler, action-oriented style to compete with television. A new Hardy Boys series, the Hardy Boys Casefiles, was created in 1987, and featured murders, violence, and international espionage. The original \"Hardy Boys Mystery Stories\" series ended in 2005. A new series, Undercover Brothers, was launched the same year, featuring updated versions of the characters who narrate their adventures in the first person. Undercover Brothers ended in 2012 and was replaced in 2013 by The Hardy Boys Adventures, also narrated in the first person. Through these changes the characters have remained popular; the books sell more than a million copies annually, several new volumes are published each year, and the adventures have been translated into over 25 languages. The boys have been featured in five television shows and several video games, and have helped promote merchandise such as lunchboxes and jeans. Critics have many explanations for the characters' longevity, suggesting that the Hardy Boys embody wish fulfillment, American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept in the later books, and the possibility of the triumph of good over evil."

It is described by Williams as \"nothing more nor less than my conception of the time and the world I live in.\" Kilroy, a young American visitor, fulfills some of the functions of the play's narrator, as does Gutman, (named after Sydney Greenstreet's character from The Maltese Falcon, but bearing more resemblance to Signor Ferrari, Greenstreet's character in Casablanca) manager of the hotel Siete Mares, whose terrace occupies part of the stage. Williams also employs a large cast of characters including many famous literary characters who appear in dream sequences. They include Don Quixote and his partner Sancho, Marguerite \"Camille\" Gautier (see The Lady of the Camellias), Casanova, Lord Byron, and Esmeralda (see The Hunchback of Notre Dame), and others. Taking place in the main plaza, the play goes through a series of confusing and almost logic-defying events, including the revival of the Gypsy's daughter (Esmeralda)'s virginity and then the loss of it again. A main theme that the play deals with is coming to terms with the thought of growing older and possibly becoming irrelevant."

Among these epistles are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity. As part of the canon of the New Testament, they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics. Most scholars agree that Paul actually wrote five of the Pauline epistles (Galatians, Romans, Philemon, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians), but that three of the epistles in Paul's name are pseudepigraphic (First Timothy, Second Timothy, and Titus) and that five other epistles are of questionable authorship (1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, 2 Thessalonians, Ephesians and Colossians). According to some scholars, Paul wrote these five letters with the help of a secretary, or amanuensis, who would have influenced their style, if not their theological content. The Epistle to the Hebrews, although it does not bear his name, was traditionally considered Pauline (although Origen, Tertullian and Hippolytus amongst others, questioned its authorship), but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content. The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Acts of the Apostles and the catholic epistles in modern editions. Most Greek manuscripts place the general epistles first, and a few minuscules (175, 325, 336, and 1424) place the Pauline epistles at the end of the New Testament."

        "title": "The Feast of the Goat_Summary",
        "content": "The Feast of the Goat (, 2000) is a novel by the Peruvian Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa. The book is set in the Dominican Republic and portrays the assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and its aftermath, from two distinct standpoints a generation apart: during and immediately after the assassination itself, in May 1961; and thirty-five years later, in 1996. Throughout, there is also extensive reflection on the heyday of the dictatorship, in the 1950s, and its significance for the island and its inhabitants. The novel follows three interwoven storylines.  The first concerns a woman, Urania Cabral, who is back in the Dominican Republic, after a long absence, to visit her ailing father. Eventually, she ends up recalling incidents from her youth before recounting a long-held secret to her aunt and cousins. The second story line focuses on the last day in Trujillo's life from the moment he wakes up onwards, and shows us the regime's inner circle, to which Urania's father once belonged. The third strand depicts Trujillo's assassins, many of whom had previously been government loyalists, as they wait for his car late that night; after the assassination, this story line shows us the assassins' persecution. Each aspect of the book's plot reveals a different viewpoint on the Dominican Republic's political and social environment, past and present. Readers are shown the regime's downward spiral, Trujillo's assassination, and its aftermath through the eyes of insiders, conspirators, and a middle-aged woman looking back. The novel is therefore a kaleidoscopic portrait of dictatorial power, including its psychological effects and its long-term impact.  The novel's themes include the nature of power and corruption, and their relationship to machismo or sexual perversion in a rigidly hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles. Memory, and the process of remembering, is also an important theme, especially in Urania's narrative as she recalls her youth in the Dominican Republic. Her story (and the book as a whole) ends when she recounts the terrible events that led to her leaving the country at the age of 14. Vargas Llosa interlaces fictional elements and historical events: the book is not a documentary and the Cabral family, for instance, is completely fictional.  On the other hand, the characters of Trujillo and Trujillo's assassins are drawn from the historical record; Vargas Llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people's stories, to further illuminate the nature of the regime and the responses it provoked. In Vargas Llosa's words, \"It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. [. . .] I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive\u2014and I have not exaggerated.\" The Feast of the Goat received largely positive reviews, with several reviewers commenting on the book's depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power, as well as the graphic descriptions of violent events. It has been described as a powerful exploration of the atrocities associated with dictatorship, and a testament to the dangers of absolute power. A film version of the novel was released in 2005, starring Isabella Rossellini, Paul Freeman, and Tomas Milian. Jorge Al\u00ed Triana and his daughter, Veronica Triana, wrote a theatrical adaptation in 2003."

The work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a whaling ship called the Grampus. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole. The story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on possible autobiographical elements as well as its portrayal of race and the symbolism in the final lines of the work. Difficulty in finding literary success early in his short story-writing career inspired Poe to pursue writing a longer work. A few serialized installments of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket were first published in the Southern Literary Messenger, though never completed. The full novel was published in July 1838 in two volumes. Some critics responded negatively to the work for being too gruesome and for cribbing heavily from other works, while others praised its exciting adventures. Poe himself later called it \"a very silly book\". The novel later influenced Herman Melville and Jules Verne."

The History of the Standard Oil Company is credited with hastening the breakup of Standard Oil, which came about in 1911, when the Supreme Court of the United States found the company to be violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The subsequent decision splintered the company into 34 \"baby Standards.\" The value of Rockefeller's shares rose after the breakup as the new companies had a positive development on the stock exchange.

Paradise Regained is four books long and comprises 2,065 lines; in contrast, Paradise Lost is twelve books long and comprises 10,565 lines. As such, Barbara K.

The story is an enigmatic examination of a young married couple, Muriel and Seymour Glass, while on vacation in Florida. It is the first of his stories to feature a member of the fictional Glass family. When twenty-eight-year-old Salinger submitted the manuscript to The New Yorker in January 1947, titled \"The Bananafish\", its arresting dialogue and precise style were read with interest by fiction editor William Maxwell and his staff, though the point of the story, in this original version, was deemed incomprehensible. At Maxwell's urging, Salinger embarked upon a major reworking of the piece, adding the opening section with Muriel's character, and crafting the material to provide insights into Seymour's tragic demise. Salinger, in frequent consultation with editor Gus Lobrano, revised the story numerous times throughout 1947, renaming it \"A Fine Day for Bananafish\". The New Yorker published the final version as \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" one year after Salinger had first submitted the manuscript. The effort was met with immediate acclaim, and according to Salinger biographer Paul Alexander, it was \"the story that would permanently change his standing in the literary community.\" Salinger's decision to collaborate with Maxwell and The New Yorker staff in developing the story marked a major advance in his career and led to his entry into that echelon of elite writers at the journal."

Griffin was a native of Mansfield, Texas, who had his skin temporarily darkened to pass as a black man. He traveled for six weeks throughout the racially segregated states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, and Georgia to explore life from the other side of the color line. Sepia Magazine financed the project in exchange for the right to print the account first as a series of articles. Griffin kept a journal of his experiences; the 188-page diary was the genesis of the book. When he started his project in 1959, race relations in America were particularly strained. The title of the book is taken from the last line of the Langston Hughes poem \"Dream Variations\". In 1964, a film version of Black Like Me, starring James Whitmore, was produced. A generation later, Robert Bonazzi published a biographical book about Griffin, these events, and his life: Man in the Mirror: John Howard Griffin and the Story of Black Like Me (1997)."

The novel chronicles the efforts of the British-educated Emperor Seth, assisted by a fellow Oxford graduate, Basil Seal, to modernize his Empire, the fictional African island of Azania, located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa. The novel was written by Waugh whilst staying as a house guest at Madresfield Court in Worcestershire. The old nursery had been converted into a writing room for Waugh. The novel is dedicated to the Lygon sisters, who had the run of the place (their father, William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, having been forced into exile under threat of prosecution for his homosexuality in 1931) and posed for some of the drawings Waugh did for the first edition. When Black Mischief was published in 1932, the editor of the Catholic journal The Tablet, Ernest Oldmeadow, launched a violent attack on the book and its author, stating that the novel was \"a disgrace to anybody professing the Catholic name\". Waugh, wrote Oldmeadow, \"was intent on elaborating a work outrageous not only to Catholic but to ordinary standards of modesty\". Waugh made no public rebuttal of these charges; an open letter to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster was prepared, but on the advice of Waugh's friends was not sent. The novel has been published in the United Kingdom by Penguin Classics (), and in the U.S.A. by Back Bay Books ()."

Originally published in 1836, the play was revised for an 1842 edition. Based upon an anecdote allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin, the play is a comedy of errors, satirizing human greed, stupidity, and the extensive political corruption of Imperial Russia. The dream-like scenes of the play, often mirroring each other, whirl in the endless vertigo of self-deception around the main character, Khlestakov, who personifies irresponsibility, light-mindedness, and absence of measure. \"He is full of meaningless movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate, on a foundation of placidly ambitious inferiority\" (D. S. Mirsky). The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary press. It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged, with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor. According to D. S. Mirsky, The Government Inspector \"is not only supreme in character and dialogue \u2013 it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning to end. The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love interest and of sympathetic characters. The latter feature was deeply resented by Gogol's enemies, and as a satire the play gained immensely from it. There is not a wrong word or intonation from beginning to end, and the comic tension is of a quality that even Gogol did not always have at his beck and call.\" In 2014, the play was ranked by The Telegraph as one of the 15 greatest ever written."

It was greeted at the time as a significant review of the post-war scene in English poetry. The introduction, written by Alvarez, is an essay called The New Poetry or Beyond the Gentility Principle. It originally appeared in a magazine called Commentary (not to be confused with the better-known New-York-based monthly of the same name) as a survey describing the state of modern poetry as Alvarez saw it. It made much play of contrasts between British/American poetry, old and then contemporary poetry, and for example Brits like Philip Larkin versus Ted Hughes. The criteria for inclusion in The New Poetry were these: the poets had to be British (which excluded Sylvia Plath from the first edition); they needed to have been young enough to have made their reputations only after 1950 (this excluded the likes of W. H. Auden and Louis MacNeice); and they had to appeal to Alvarez himself. There were two exceptions to the first and second of these guidelines: Alvarez included long well-established Americans Robert Lowell and John Berryman at the start of the anthology. Alvarez concluded that Lowell and Berryman were the most influential figures on British poetry writing at that time, which justified their inclusion. Each poet was represented with a minimum of five poems. In the revised edition (1966) Alvarez relaxed these rules somewhat to allow Plath and yet another American poet, Anne Sexton, to be represented. In some senses the anthology can be seen as a reaction to Robert Conquest's New Lines anthology, which appeared a decade before. The anthology included a very brief biographical note on each of the poets. The revised edition included three poems by Sylvia Plath that were previously unpublished."

The Dark Is Rising Sequence is used as an over-arching title in several omnibus, boxed-set, and coordinated editions; but the title of The Dark is Rising is also used for the whole series. The books depict a struggle between forces of good and evil called \"The Light\" and \"The Dark\", and draw upon Arthurian legends, Celtic mythology, Norse mythology and English folklore. Both magical and ordinary children are prominent throughout the series. It was inaugurated in 1965 with the U.K. publication by Jonathan Cape of Over Sea, Under Stone. The sequels were published 1973 to 1977, almost simultaneously in the U.K. and the U.S. Volume four, The Grey King (1975), won both the Newbery Medal, recognizing the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\", and the inaugural Welsh Tir na n-Og Award for English-language books with Welsh background. The concluding Silver on the Tree (1977) also won the annual Tir na n-Og Award. The novel The Dark Is Rising features Will Stanton, age 11, who learns on that birthday that he is one of an ancient magical people called \"Old Ones\", and is destined to wield the powers of The Light in the ancient struggle with The Dark. In the U.S. it was a Newbery Honor Book (runner up for the medal).

He draws from contemporary diaries, memoirs, letters, newspaper accounts, the biographical writings of John Hay and John Nicolay (Lincoln's secretaries), and the work of modern historians."

        "content": "Humanist Manifesto II, written in 1973 by humanists Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson, was an update to the previous Humanist Manifesto published in 1933, and the second entry in the Humanist Manifesto series.  It begins with a statement that the excesses of National Socialism and world war had made the first seem too optimistic, and indicated a more hardheaded and realistic approach in its seventeen-point statement, which was much longer and more elaborate than the previous version.  Nevertheless, much of the optimism of the first remained, expressing hope that war and poverty would be eliminated. In addition to its absolute rejection of theism, deism and belief in credible proof of any afterlife, various political stances are supported, such as opposition to racism, weapons of mass destruction, support of human rights, a proposition of an international court, and the right to unrestricted contraception, abortion and divorce and death with dignity, ex. euthanasia and suicide. Initially published with a small number of signatures, the document was circulated and gained thousands more, and indeed the American Humanist Association's website encourages visitors to add their own name.  A provision at the end stating that the signators do \"not necessarily endorse every detail\" of the document, but only its broad vision, no doubt helped many overcome reservations about attaching their name. One of the oft-quoted lines that comes from this manifesto is, \"No deity will save us; we must save ourselves.\" The Humanist Manifesto II first appeared in The Humanist September / October, 1973, when Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson were editor and editor emeritus, respectively."

        "content": "Unto This Last is an essay critical of economics by John Ruskin, first published between August and December 1860 in the monthly journal Cornhill Magazine in four articles. Ruskin says himself that the articles were \"very violently criticized\", forcing the publisher to stop its publication after four months. Subscribers sent protest letters, but Ruskin countered the attack and published the four articles in a book in May 1862. The book greatly influenced the nonviolent activist Mahatma Gandhi.  The book is also cited as an inspiration upon the British Labour Party in its initial stages, a survey of Labour Members of Parliament after the party achieved its electoral breakthrough in the 1906 UK general election listing the book as one of their key influences. The title is a quotation from the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard: The \"last\" are the eleventh hour labourers, who are paid as if they had worked the entire day.  Rather than discuss the contemporary religious interpretation of the parable, whereby the eleventh hour labourers would be death-bed converts, or the peoples of the world who come late to religion, Ruskin looks at the social and economic implications, discussing issues such as who should receive a living wage. This essay is very critical of the economists of the 18th and 19th centuries. In this sense, Ruskin is a precursor of social economy. Because the essay also attacks the destructive effects of industrialism upon the natural world, some historians have seen it as anticipating the Green movement. The essay begins with the following verses, taken from Matthew 20:13 and Zechariah 11:12 respectively (in the King James Version): Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way. I will give unto this last even as unto thee."

The film is about a submarine crew who are shrunk to microscopic size and venture into the body of an injured scientist to repair damage to his brain. Kleiner abandoned all but the concept of miniaturization and added a Cold War element. The film starred Stephen Boyd, Raquel Welch, Edmond O'Brien, Donald Pleasence, and Arthur Kennedy. Bantam Books obtained the rights for a paperback novelization based on the screenplay and approached Isaac Asimov to write it. Because the novelization was released six months before the movie, many people mistakenly believed that the film was based on Asimov's book. Its modern and imaginative production design got it five nominations at the 39th Academy Awards mostly in technical departments, winning for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction in Color. The movie inspired an animated television series of the same name and helped popularize the concept of miniaturization in science fiction along with The Incredible Shrinking Man, especially the idea of doing so to travel into the human body, being consistently referenced and parodied in multiple media."

It features a great diversity of people in a single place across the ages.  Most of them are ordinary people living unprivileged lives.  It is told thorough a series of flashbacks featuring an ordinary man in modern times.  He is looking for his grandfather who has not returned from a hill-walk, but has visions of the past as it might have been. It begins in the Old Stone Age and extends through to the Middle Ages, telling a series of fictionalized short stories about ordinary people in the Welsh-border region of the Black Mountains where he was born and grew up. The series is solidly based on what archaeologists have found \u2013 some of the tales are speculative reconstructions based on real burials.  It has been praised for \"brilliant clarity and imaginative vision\" (Sunday Telegraph) and hailed as \"the great historic novel Wales has long deserved\" (Wales on Sunday). The story-sequence  would have extended to modern times had Williams lived to finish it.  What exists is a complete story arc extending from the Old Stone Age to the late-Mediaeval period.  The story begins in the Old Stone Age and was intended to come right up to modern times, always focusing on ordinary people. He had completed it as mediaeval times when he died in 1988. It was prepared for publication by his wife Joy Williams and was published in two volumes, along with a Postscript that gives a brief description of what the remaining work would have been."

According to James Bridle, Berger \"didn't just help us gain a new perspective on viewing art with his 1972 series Ways of Seeing \u2013 he also revealed much about the world in which we live. Whether exploring the history of the female nude or the status of oil paint, his landmark series showed how art revealed the social and political systems in which it was made. He also examined what had changed in our ways of seeing in the time between when the art was made and today.\" The series has had a lasting influence, and in particular introduced the concept of the male gaze, as part of his analysis of the treatment of the nude in European painting.  It soon became popular among feminists, including the British film critic Laura Mulvey, who used it to critique traditional media representations of the female character in cinema."

        "title": "The Physician's Tale_Summary",
        "content": "\"The Physician's Tale\" is one of The Canterbury Tales, written by Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century. It is a domestic drama about the relationship between a daughter and her father, based on a tale from the Histories of Titus Livius and retold in The Romance of the Rose, as well as John Gower's Confessio Amantis, which Chaucer drew on for inspiration, and the biblical story of Jephtha. Although difficult to date like most of Chaucer's tales, the Physician's tale is usually regarded as an early work of Chaucer probably written before much of the rest of the Canterbury Tales was begun. The long digression on governesses possibly alludes to a historical event and may serve to date it: in 1386 Elizabeth, the daughter of John of Gaunt, eloped to France with John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. Elizabeth's governess was Katherine Swynford, who was also Gaunt's mistress and later wife. Chaucer's words on the virtues of governesses were potentially influenced by this. The story is considered one of the moral tales, along with the Parson's tale and the Knight's tale. However, the fate of Virginius renders questionable the moral assertion at the story's end. The Host enjoys the tale and feels for the daughter but asks the Pardoner for a more merry tale.  The Pardoner obliges and his tale has a similar but contrasting moral message."

Commissioned by Jacqueline Kennedy, it premiered on September 8, 1971, conducted by Maurice Peress and choreographed by Alvin Ailey. The production used costume designs by Frank Thompson. The performance was part of the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Mass premiered in Europe in 1973, with John Mauceri conducting the Yale Symphony Orchestra in Vienna. Originally, Bernstein had intended to compose a traditional Mass, but instead decided on a more \"innovative\" form. The work is based on the Tridentine Mass of the Catholic Church. The liturgical passages are sung mostly in Latin, though the \"Sanctus\" includes portions in Hebrew. Mass also includes additional texts in English written by Bernstein, Broadway composer Stephen Schwartz, and Paul Simon (who wrote the first quatrain of the trope \"Half of the People\"). The work is intended to be staged theatrically, but it has also been performed in a standard concert setting. Initial critical reception, including a review in the New York Times, was largely negative, but the Columbia Records recording of the work enjoyed excellent sales."

It is set in an unnamed city that is experiencing a revolutionary uprising in the streets; most of the action takes place in an upmarket brothel that functions as a microcosm of the regime of the establishment under threat outside. Since Peter Zadek directed the first English-language production at the Arts Theatre Club in London in 1957, the play has been revived frequently (in various versions) and has attracted many prominent directors, including Peter Brook, Erwin Piscator, Roger Blin, Giorgio Strehler, and JoAnne Akalaitis. It has been adapted as a film and given operatic treatment. The play's dramatic structure integrates Genet's concern with meta-theatricality and role-playing, and consists of two central strands: a political conflict between revolution and counter-revolution and a philosophical one between reality and illusion. Genet suggested that the play should be performed as a \"glorification of the Image and the Reflection.\" Genet's biographer Edmund White wrote that with The Balcony, along with The Blacks (1959), Genet re-invented modern theatre. The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan described the play as the rebirth of the spirit of the classical Athenian comic playwright Aristophanes, while the philosopher Lucien Goldmann argued that despite its \"entirely different world view\" it constitutes \"the first great Brechtian play in French literature.\" Martin Esslin has called The Balcony \"one of the masterpieces of our time.\""

On 23 March 1951 Asimov met with his agent, Frederik Pohl, and Walter I. Bradbury, then the science fiction editor at Doubleday & Co., who had a proposal for him. Pohl and Bradbury wanted Asimov to write a juvenile science fiction novel that would serve as the basis for a television series. Fearing that the novel would be adapted into the \"uniformly awful\" programming he saw flooding the television channels, he decided to publish it under the pseudonym \"Paul French\". Asimov began work on the novel, David Starr: Space Ranger, on 10 June. He completed it on 29 July, and it was published by Doubleday in January 1952. Although plans for the television series fell through, Asimov continued to write novels in the series, eventually producing six. A seventh, Lucky Starr and the Snows of Pluto, was planned, but abandoned when Asimov elected to devote himself to writing non-fiction almost exclusively. With no worries about being associated with an embarrassing televised version, Asimov decided to abandon the pretense that he was not the author (although the books continued to be published under the Paul French pseudonym). He brought the Three Laws of Robotics into Lucky Starr and the Big Sun of Mercury, which he wrote in his autobiography \"was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for even the most casual reader\". Eventually, Asimov used his own name in later editions. Some cover pages bear his name only, while others credit \"Isaac Asimov writing as Paul French\"."

        "content": "The Defence of the Seven Sacraments () is a theological treatise published in 1521, written by King Henry VIII of England, allegedly with the assistance of Thomas More. The extent of More's involvement with this project has been a point of contention since its publication. Henry started to write it in 1519 while he was reading Martin Luther's attack on indulgences. By June of that year, he had shown it to Thomas Wolsey, but it remained private until three years later, when the earlier manuscript became the first two chapters of the Assertio, the rest consisting of new material relating to Luther's De Captivitate Babylonica. Author J. J. Scarisbrick describes the work as \"one of the most successful pieces of Catholic polemics produced by the first generation of anti-Protestant writers.\" It went through some twenty editions in the sixteenth century and, as early as 1522, had appeared in two different German translations. It was dedicated to Pope Leo X, who rewarded Henry with the title Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) in October 1521 (a title revoked following the king's break with the Catholic Church in the 1530s,<ref>Assertio septem sacramentorum adversus Martinum Lutherum, Henry VIII, King of England; Pierre Fraenkel, M\u00fcnster, Aschendorff, 1992, Corpus Catholicorum, vol. 43.  </ref> but re-awarded to his heir by the English Parliament). Luther's reply to the Assertio (Against Henry, King of the English) was, in turn, replied to by Thomas More, who was one of the leaders of the Catholic Renaissance humanists in England (Responsio ad Lutherum). The British Library still has King Henry VIII's personal copy of Marko Maruli\u0107's Evangelistiarium, a book that was read in English and much admired by Sir Thomas More. Extensive margin notes in the King's own hand prove that Maruli\u0107's book was a major source used by the King in the writing of Defence of the Seven Sacraments."

Written in exile in the United States, it tells the story of Cheng's arrest during the first days of the Cultural Revolution, her more than six years' confinement, release, persecution, efforts to leave China, and early life in exile. Cheng was arrested in late 1966 after the Red Guards looted her home.  During her confinement, she was pressured to make a false confession that she was a spy for \"the imperialists\" because for many years after the death of her husband she had continued to work as a senior partner for Shell in Shanghai.  Cheng refused to provide a false confession, and was tortured as a result. She was eventually paroled under the pretense that her attitude had shown improvement.  However, Cheng resisted leaving the detention house without receiving acknowledgment from her captors that she had been unjustly treated. When released from jail in 1973, Cheng found that her daughter Meiping, who had been studying to become a film actress, had been murdered by the Red Guards, although the official position was that she had committed suicide. Cheng conducted a discreet investigation and found that this scenario was impossible. After being relocated from her spacious home to a mere two bedrooms on the second floor of a two-story building, Cheng continued her life under constant surveillance, including spying by the family on the first floor. She lived in China until 1980, when the political climate warmed enough for her to apply for a visa to the United States to visit family. She never returned, first emigrating to Canada, and later to Washington, D.C., where she wrote the autobiography. The autobiography goes into great detail about her persecution, confinement and torture, so much so that the author had to put the manuscript away many times as she wrote it because the memories were so troubling."

Seen through the eyes of the idealistic scientist Leo Kall, Kallocain is a depiction of a totalitarian world state. An important aspect of the novel is the relationships and connections between the various characters, such as the marriage of the main character and his wife, Linda Kall, and the feelings of jealousy and suspicion that may arise in a society with heavy surveillance and legal uncertainty. One of the novel's central ideas coincides with contemporary rumors of truth drugs that ensured the subordination of every citizen to the state. Both Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) and Boye's Kallocain are drug dystopias, or societies in which pharmacology is used to suppress opposition to authority. However, unlike Brave New World in which a drug is used to suppress the urge to nonconformity generally, a drug in Kallocain is used to detect individual acts and thoughts of rebellion. Kallocain has been translated into more than 10 languages; English-language translations include those by Gustaf Lannestock (2002, University of Wisconsin Press) and David McDuff (2019, Penguin Classics). It was adapted into a television miniseries in 1981 by Hans Abramson. In 2016, the novel was nominated for the Retro-Hugo award for the best science fiction novel of 1941."

        "content": "The Catalogue of Women ()\u2014also known as the Ehoiai  (, )\u2014is a fragmentary Greek epic poem that was attributed to Hesiod during antiquity. The \"women\" of the title were in fact heroines, many of whom lay with gods, bearing the heroes of Greek mythology to both divine and mortal paramours. In contrast with the focus upon narrative in the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, the Catalogue was structured around a vast system of genealogies stemming from these unions and, in M. L. West's appraisal, covered \"the whole of the heroic age.\" Through the course of the poem's five books, these family trees were embellished with stories involving many of their members, and so the poem amounted to a compendium of heroic mythology in much the same way that the Hesiodic Theogony presents a systematic account of the Greek pantheon built upon divine genealogies. Most scholars do not currently believe that the Catalogue should be considered the work of Hesiod, but questions about the poem's authenticity have not lessened its interest for the study of literary, social and historical topics. As a Hesiodic work that treats in depth the Homeric world of the heroes, the Catalogue offers a transition between the divine sphere of the Theogony and the terrestrial focus of the Works and Days by virtue of its subjects' status as demigods. Given the poem's concentration upon heroines in addition to heroes, it provides evidence for the roles and perceptions of women in Greek literature and society during the period of its composition and popularity. Greek aristocratic communities, the ruling elite, traced their lineages back to the heroes of epic poetry; thus the Catalogue, a veritable \"map of the Hellenic world in genealogical terms,\" preserves much information about a complex system of kinship associations and hierarchies that continued to have political importance long after the Archaic period. Many of the myths in the Catalogue are otherwise unattested, either entirely so or in the form narrated therein, and held a special fascination for poets and scholars from the late Archaic period through the Hellenistic and Roman eras. Despite its popularity among the Hellenistic literati and reading public of Roman Egypt, the poem went out of circulation before it could pass into a medieval manuscript tradition and is preserved today by papyrus fragments and quotations in ancient authors. Still, the Catalogue is much better attested than most \"lost\" works, with some 1,300 whole or partial lines surviving: \"between a third and a quarter of the original poem\", by one estimate. The evidence for the poem's reconstruction\u2014not only elements of its content, but the distribution of that content within the Catalogue\u2014is indeed extensive, but the fragmentary nature of this evidence leaves many unresolved complexities and has over the course of the past century led to several scholarly missteps."

        "content": "The White Company is a historical adventure by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, set during the Hundred Years' War. The story is set in England, France, and Spain, in the years 1366 and 1367, against the background of the campaign of Edward, the Black Prince, to restore Peter of Castile to the throne of the Kingdom of Castile. The climax of the book occurs before the Battle of N\u00e1jera. Doyle became inspired to write the novel after attending a lecture on the Middle Ages in 1889.  After extensive research, The White Company was published in serialized form in 1891 in Cornhill Magazine. Additionally, the book is considered a companion to Doyle's 1905-06 Sir Nigel, which explores the early campaigns of Sir Nigel Loring and Samkin Aylward. The novel is relatively unknown today, though it was very popular up through the Second World War. In fact, Doyle himself regarded this and his other historical novels more highly than the Sherlock Holmes adventures for which he is mainly remembered. The \"White Company\" of the title is a free company of archers, led by one of the main characters.  The name is taken from a real-life 14th-century Italian mercenary company, led by John Hawkwood."

However, its success has always remained a phenomenon in Belgium and the Netherlands, and attempts at marketing foreign translations have all failed."

Raise the Titanic! was the third published book to feature the author's protagonist, Dirk Pitt. It was the first of Cussler's novels with a prologue set long before the main story, describing an incident with consequences resolved in the present day. The book was adapted into a 1980 feature film, Raise the Titanic, directed by Jerry Jameson. The film was produced by Lord Grade's ITC Entertainment. Although it starred respected and popular actors and boasted a big budget, the movie was a box office bomb and received little critical or popular praise and was also disliked by Cussler."

Highly popular and influential in its time, The Spanish Tragedy established a new genre in English theatre, the revenge play or revenge tragedy. The play contains several violent murders and includes as one of its characters a personification of Revenge. The Spanish Tragedy is often considered to be the first mature Elizabethan drama, a claim disputed with Christopher Marlowe's Tamburlaine, and was parodied by many Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights, including Marlowe, William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Many elements of The Spanish Tragedy, such as the play-within-a-play used to trap a murderer and a ghost intent on vengeance, appear in Shakespeare's Hamlet. (Thomas Kyd is frequently proposed as the author of the hypothetical Ur-Hamlet that may have been one of Shakespeare's primary sources for Hamlet.)"

It contains some of the very first realistic drawings of Egyptian monuments and to this day remains a primary source for the looks of Egyptian monuments before widespread 19th and 20th-century tourism and excavations. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, under the order of Frederick V of Denmark, first published the book in 1755. Norden had already done some preliminary work, but got entangled in war-service for England and died in France 1742 of tuberculosis before anything was ready. He left his documents and drawings to his friend. Mark Tuscher from Nuremberg made the drawings into copperplates for the publication. Norden published some test drawings from his voyage in 1741, under the long name Drawings of Some Ruins and Colossal Statues at Thebes in Egypt, with an account of the same in a letter to the Royal Society. A very often-used extract from this book is Norden's drawing of the Great Sphinx of Giza. As the first near-realistic drawing of the sphinx, he is the earliest known to draw the Sphinx with the nose missing. Although Richard Pococke in the same year visits and later publishes a stylish rendering (in A Description of the East and Some other Countries, 1743), he draws it with the nose still on. Pococke's drawing is a faithful adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698 (Voyage to the Levant, 1702, English trans.), featuring only minor changes. It is highly unlikely if the nose was still on that Norden out of free fantasy would leave it out. This drawing is often used to disprove the story that Napoleon I of France destroyed the nose of the Sphinx."

The original First Edition, self-published in 1974 by Moosewood, was a spiral bound paper-covered book, with photographs of the restaurant staff, with illustrations hand-drawn and text hand-written by Molly Katzen. It was printed by the Glad Day Press in Ithaca. The full title of the self-published edition was The Moosewood Cookbook, Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant in the Dewitt Mall, Ithaca, New York. The book was then picked up by the then-fledgling Ten Speed Press in California, whose edition was given a different cover and hand-lettered and illustrated by Katzen. Katzen later rewrote the book with leaner recipes in a version published in 1992, long after her original association with the Collective had lapsed, though she kept the title and the hand-lettered style; the later Collective went on to publish its own unrelated series of books.  Katzen has written two books that might be considered sequels; the first, called The Enchanted Broccoli Forest, expands on topics such as baking that the Moosewood book does not cover in depth, and is done in the same hand-lettered style as the original. The second, The Vegetable Dishes I Can't Live Without, came out in 2007 and returned to Katzen's original hand-written style after years of more conventionally designed books such as Still Life with Menu and Pretend Soup."

It was the last of a number of works composed toward the end of his life which were deeply autobiographical in nature. Previous elements in this group included The Confessions and Dialogues: Rousseau, Judge of Jean-Jacques. The book is divided into ten chapters called \"Walks\" (\"Promenades\" in the original French). Walks One to Seven are complete, the Eighth and Ninth Walks were completed but not revised by Rousseau, while the Tenth Walk was incomplete at the author's death. The first publication was in 1782. The content of the book is a mix of autobiographical anecdote, descriptions of the sights, especially plants, that Rousseau saw in his walks on the outskirts of Paris, and elaborations and extensions of arguments previously made by Rousseau in fields like education and political philosophy. The work is in large parts marked by serenity and resignation, but also bears witness to Rousseau's awareness of the ill-effects of persecution towards the end of his life."

        "content": "The 480 is a political fiction novel by Eugene Burdick (1964). The plot revolves around the political turmoil after John F. Kennedy assassination in 1963. In the novel, a fictitious charismatic character, John Thatch, an engineer, is seeking nomination for the Republican Party candidate at 1964 presidential elections. He is described as being contaminated with the \"political virus\". A handful of political professionals are promoting his nomination, in confrontation with the Party establishment. There exist apparent parallels between Thatch and Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., a write-in hero at New Hampshire primary. The novel criticizes the socio-political effects on society at large from the use of computers to run massive simulations, which predict the public reaction to certain (proposed) political moves before implementing them. Such simulations make it easy to manipulate the public consciousness. The \"480\" in the title denotes the number of groups (by party affiliation, socioeconomic status, location, origin, etc.) that the computer simulation uses to classify the American electorate. The full list of these is reproduced in the Appendix, claimed by the author to be the true list used by the Simulmatics Corporation (real name) in Senator John F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign in 1960. The cover features an IBM 5081 punched card. The Simulmatics Corporation was created by MIT Professor Ithiel de Sola Pool, who provided a non-fiction backup to \"The 480\" in \"Candidates, Issues, and Strategies: A Computer Simulation of the 1960 Presidential Election,\" MIT Press, 1964 (with co-authors Robert P. Abelson and Samuel L. Popkin). They built their model from 130,000 archived interviews in Gallup and Roper polls over a ten-year period. Based on its output, they advised Kennedy that he would benefit from a strong civil rights stand and that he had nothing to lose, and much to gain, by attacking religious bigotry and dealing frankly with his Catholicism. The 480 has been cited as prefiguring the effect of modern social media and data gathering on politics."

The author proposes that sometime around the end of the last Ice Age this civilisation ended in cataclysm, but passed on to its inheritors profound knowledge of such things as astronomy, architecture and mathematics. Hancock's views are based on the idea that mainstream interpretations of archaeological evidence are flawed or incomplete. The book was followed by Magicians of the Gods."

It is set in Edwardian London where the world, like main character Leonard Morley's life, is changing. We start the book with a single note which seems to leave a smudge on Leonard and his family life. The book continues with himself, two sons, a daughter and a wife as well as a large extended family all making room for one more, when curiously charming 'Doctor' Tobias Taylor appears on the scene. However curiosity killed more than just a cat, as the family soon finds out. Leonard Morley, in the very first chapter, receives a threatening note, requesting blood money in the absence of Mr Whiteley, his manager and Leonard informs his wife of it, who dismisses it avidly. However, over time more of these notes turn up, and when the fourth has found its way to Leonard, he resolves to tell Mr Whiteley. But whilst waiting to speak to him, Mr Whiteley is shot, and is lying in a pool of blood. In the court scene, where Leonard stands as witness, all over London people flock to see the trial. In the end, Horace Rayner is charged with murder, and given a life sentence. This book very cleverly entwines fact with fiction, and Whiteley's assassination being involved is the first example that comes to mind."

The book puts on an unauthorized account of the creation, early success, abrupt collapse, and rushed bailout of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM).  LTCM was a tightly-held American hedge fund founded in 1993 which commanded more than $100 billion in assets at its height, then collapsed abruptly in August/September 1998.  Prompted by deep concerns about LTCM's thousands of derivative contracts, in order to avoid a panic by banks and investors worldwide, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York stepped in to organize a bailout with the various major banks at risk. The book's account is largely based on interviews conducted with former employees of LTCM, the six primary banks involved in the rescue, and the Federal Reserve, as well as informal interactions by phone and e-mail with Eric Rosenfeld, one of LTCM's founding partners.  As of 2014, there have been four editions in English, five editions in Japanese, one edition in Russian and one edition in Chinese.

        "content": "Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess, often simply called the Handbuch) is a chess book, first published in 1843 by Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa. It was a comprehensive reference book on the game, and one of the most important references on opening theory for many decades. The Handbuch had been the project of Paul Rudolf von Bilguer, who was with von der Lasa a member of the Berlin Chess Club and the influential group of chess masters later called the Berlin Pleiades. Bilguer died in 1840, with the work still in the early stages.  Von der Lasa completed the project and saw it published, with his friend von Bilguer alone named as author.  It contained comprehensive analyses of all opening variations then known, plus a section on the history and literature of chess. Von der Lasa prepared four further editions (1852, 1858, 1864, and 1874). The sixth edition (1880) was by Constantin Schwede; and the seventh edition (1891) was by Emil Schallopp, with the assistance of Louis Paulsen.  Carl Schlechter, who had drawn a match for the World Championship with Emanuel Lasker in 1910, prepared the eighth and final edition. Published in eleven parts between 1912 and 1916, it totaled 1,040 pages and included contributions by Rudolf Spielmann, Siegbert Tarrasch, and Richard Teichmann. International Master William Hartston called it \"a superb work, perhaps the last to encase successfully the whole of chess knowledge within a single volume.\""

Its main character is Archie Rice, a failing music-hall performer. Years later, Tony Richardson, who directed The Entertainer's premiere season, described Archie as  \"the embodiment of a national mood ... Archie was the future, the decline, the sourness, the ashes of old glory, where Britain was heading.\" The first performance was given on 10 April 1957 at the Royal Court Theatre, London.  That theatre was known for its commitment to new and non-traditional drama, and the inclusion of a West End star such as Olivier in the cast caused much interest."

        "content": "The Medical Compendium in Seven Books (; romanized: Epitomes iatrikes biblia hepta) is a medical treatise written in Greek the 7th century CE by Paul of Aegina a.k.a. Paulus Aegineta. The work is chiefly a compilation from former writers; and the preface contains the following summary of the contents of each book: In the first book you will find every thing that relates to hygiene, and to the preservation from, and correction of, distempers peculiar to the various ages, seasons, temperaments, and so forth; also the powers and uses of the different articles of food, as is set forth in the chapter of contents. In the second is explained the whole doctrine of fevers, an account of certain matters relating to them being premised, such as excrementitious discharges, critical days, and other appearances, and concluding with certain symptoms that are the concomitants of fever. The third book relates to topical affections, beginning from the crown of the head, and descending down to the nails of the feet. The fourth book treats of those complaints that are external and exposed to view, and are not limited to one part of the body, but affect various parts. Also, of intestinal worms and dracunculi. The fifth treats of the wounds and bites of venomous animals; also of the distemper called hydrophobia, and of persons bitten by dogs that are mad, and by those that are not mad; and also of persons bitten by men. Afterwards it treats of deleterious substances, and of the preservatives from them. In the sixth book is contained every thing relating to surgery, both what relates to the fleshy parts, such as the extraction of weapons, and to the bones, which comprehends fractures and dislocations. In the seventh is contained an account of the properties of all medicines, first of the simple, then of the compound, particularly of those I had mentioned in the preceding six books, and more especially the greater, and, as it were, celebrated preparations; for I did not think it proper to treat of all these articles promiscuously, lest it should occasion confusion, but so that any person looking for one or more of the distinguished preparations might easily find it. Towards the end are certain things connected with the composition of medicines, and of those articles that may be substituted for one another, the whole concluding with an account of weights and measures. Although Byzantine medicine drew largely on ancient Greek and Roman knowledge, however, his works also contained many new ideas as he was a teacher from Alexandria. For example, in several volumes Paul of Aegina talks about bone structure and fractures, as shown below: The case of a broken thigh is analogous to that of the arm, but in particular, a fractured thigh is mostly deranged forwards and outwards, for the bone is naturally flattened on those sides. It is to be set by the hands, with ligatures, and even cords applied, the one above and the other below the fracture. When the fracture takes place at one end, if' at the head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perinaeum, and the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture. Pieces of bone that irritate the parts, as has been often said, are to be taken out from above; and the rest of' the treatment we have already described in the section on the arm. The thigh gets consolidated within fifty days. The manner of arranging it afterwards will be described after delivering the treatment of the whole leg."

Their illicit relationship serves to isolate them from their friends and from society at large. The book eschews all conventional descriptions of exteriors for the sake of detailed accounts of feelings and states of mind. Constant began the novel on 30 October 1806, and completed it some time before 1810. While still working on it he read drafts to individual acquaintances and to small audiences, and after its first publication in London and Paris in June 1816 it went through three further editions: in July 1816 (new preface), July 1824 in Paris (restorations to Ch. 8, third preface), and in 1828.

She described this as \"a human project\" about learning. She states at the beginning that she is a lesbian but not transgender. In the book, she describes her experiences as a man in strip clubs, on dates, and as part of a men's support group. In order to effectively pose as a man, Vincent acquired a buzz cut and flattened her chest using a small sports bra. She also hired a makeup artist to fake a five o'clock shadow and trained for months to imitate a deeper male voice. She changed her diet and exercise regime to \"bulk up\" with more upper-body muscle. Vincent joined a men's bowling team, where she says \"[the men] just took me in ... no questions asked.\" She eventually became friends with them, even coming along to strip clubs and dating women who had no idea of her true gender. She later revealed that she was actually female to the men, who \"took it well.\" Vincent also recorded Self-Made Man as an audiobook for Penguin Highbridge. Vincent writes about how the only time she has ever been considered excessively feminine was during her stint as a man: her alter ego, Ned, was assumed to be gay on several occasions, and features which in her as a woman had been seen as \"butch\" became oddly effeminate when seen in a man. Vincent asserts that, since the experiment, she has gained more sympathy for the male condition, stating, \"Men are suffering. They have different problems than women have but they don't have it better. They need our sympathy, they need our love, and they need each other more than anything else. They need to be together.\""

It is set in 91 BC, when Lucius Licinius Crassus dies, just before the Social War and the civil war between Marius and Sulla, during which Marcus Antonius (orator), the other great orator of this dialogue, dies. During this year, the author faces a difficult political situation: after his return from exile in Dyrrachium (modern Albania), his house was destroyed by the gangs of Clodius in a time when violence was common.  This was intertwined with the street politics of Rome. Amidst the moral and political decadence of the state, Cicero wrote De Oratore to describe the ideal orator and imagine him as a moral guide of the state. He did not intend De Oratore as merely a treatise on rhetoric, but went beyond mere technique to make several references to philosophical principles. Cicero believed that the power of persuasion\u2014the ability to verbally manipulate opinion in crucial political decisions\u2014was a key issue and that in the hands of an unprincipled orator, this power would endanger the entire community. As a consequence, moral principles can be taken either by the examples of noble men of the past or by the great Greek philosophers, who provided ethical ways to be followed in their teaching and their works. The perfect orator shall be not merely a skilled speaker without moral principles, but both an expert of rhetorical technique and a man of wide knowledge in law, history, and ethical principles. De Oratore is an exposition of issues, techniques, and divisions in rhetoric; it is also a parade of examples for several of them and it makes continuous references to philosophical concepts to be merged for a perfect result."

Beerbohm's tale is a lighter, more humorous version of Oscar Wilde's 1890 classic tale of moral degeneration, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The Happy Hypocrite tells the story of a man who deceives a woman with a mask in order to marry her. The book was published by John Lane at The Bodley Head, in New York City and in London in 1897. In 1900 the story was produced as a stage show at the Royalty Theatre in London starring Frank Mills and Mrs Patrick Campbell. In 1936 the play was revived at His Majesty's Theatre starring Ivor Novello, Vivien Leigh, Isabel Jeans and Marius Goring. An edition with colour  illustrations by George Sheringham was published by John Lane in November 1918. The story was adapted as a one-act radio opera, Lord Inferno, by Giorgio Federico Ghedini to a libretto by Franco Antonicelli; it premiered on RAI on 22 October 1952. It was staged as L'ipocrita felice at the Piccola Scala in Milan on 10 March 1956."

Granting for the sake of argument that the fetus has a right to life, Thomson uses thought experiments to argue that the fetus's right to life does not override the pregnant woman's right to have jurisdiction over her body, and that induced abortion is therefore not morally impermissible. Thomson's argument has many critics on both sides of the abortion debate, yet it continues to receive defense. Thomson's imaginative examples and controversial conclusions have made \"A Defense of Abortion\" perhaps \"the most widely reprinted essay in all of contemporary philosophy\"."

This book was first published in the United States in 1968 by The Crime Club, and in the United Kingdom later that year by Hodder and Stoughton. This is the first time since 1948's Call for the Saint that the novella format had been used in the series; with a few exceptions where full-length novels were published, the novella format would remain the norm until the series concluded in the early 1980s. It is the first of three Saint books to first see publication in 1968, which was also the 40th anniversary of the character's introduction. This was the first of several volumes of stories novelising episodes of the 1962-69 television series The Saint. As with the previous volume, Vendetta for the Saint, Charteris receives front-cover author credit, when in fact other authors actually wrote the text. In his introduction to this book, Charteris names Fleming Lee as his hand-picked successor, and indicates his preference for having original storylines by John Kruse be used whenever possible. Charteris identifies this process of ghost writing as \"an unprecedented experiment in team work\". Charteris remained in editorial control of the books for the remainder of the series, which continued until 1983's Salvage for the Saint."

The tales are told with an irreverent voice and comic nonsense.  At one point the stars are heard to sing, \"Boodle-dum dee, boodle-dum dar, isn't it fun, being a star?\" To which the moon answers, \"I'm just the moon, but that's fine by me, so long as I hear that boodle-dum dee!\" Some of the dialogue is surprisingly adult (\"That is one hell of a beautiful butterfly\", says an admiring frog) and some of the tales end on a rather sad note, but they also feature the old-fashioned lessons and fearsome monsters one would expect of fairy tales. In April 2009, the book was chosen by Children's Laureate Michael Rosen as one of his five best children's stories of all time."

Inge won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work, and Logan received a Tony Award for Best Director. The play also won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play of the season. Picnic was Paul Newman's Broadway debut. An unknown at the time, Newman campaigned heavily for the leading role of Hal, but director Joshua Logan did not think Newman was physically large enough to convey the lead character's athletic attributes. As a result, Ralph Meeker was given the role of Hal opposite Janice Rule as Madge. Newman played Hal's former college roommate Alan Seymour while understudying the role of Hal. Newman eventually took over the lead role."

Duncan Edgeworth's relationship with his wife Ellen can be seen as problematic from very early on, and it is even assumed that when you read the title of the book you think that the 'head' is male based on the patriarchal stereotype. This book casually pokes fun at the art of idle gossip. Whenever she was asked which of her novels were her favorites, Compton-Burnett always referred to A House and Its Head and Manservant and Maidservant. Susan Sontag listed the novels of Compton-Burnett as examples of \"camp\" in her essay, Notes on \"Camp\" in 1964."

Although the story depicts a sinister cult, this cult offers a conventionally occult devil-worshipping threat, rather than the cosmic threat depicted in his later work.  Living in poverty in the slum of Red Hook at the time of writing, Lovecraft was at this time urgently attempting to widen his markets in the pulp magazines. By having an unusually proactive Irish New York police detective as his protagonist, he hoped for a swift sale to a detective pulp, which would have opened up a new market other than his usual Weird Tales magazine.  He did not get such a sale, and had to fall back on Weird Tales. \"Red Hook\" was thus first published in the January 1927 issue of Weird Tales."

The book was published during the ideological divide caused by the Cold War, when most of Latin American countries had brutal, right-wing dictatorships. Open Veins was banned in several countries and quickly became a bible for an entire generation of left-wing thinkers. In the book, Galeano analyzes the history of the Americas as a whole, from the time period of the European settlement of the New World to contemporary Latin America, describing the effects of European and later United States economic exploitation and political dominance over the region. Throughout the book, Galeano analyses notions of colonialism, imperialism, and the dependency theory. Open Veins illustrates Latin America's resistance literature of the twentieth century, characterized by opposition to imperialism and a heightened Pan-American sentiment. The book has sold over a million copies and been translated into over a dozen languages. It has been included in university courses \"ranging from history and anthropology to economics and geography.\""

It consists of Australia Felix (1917), The Way Home (1925), and Ultima Thule (1929).  It was collected in 1930 under the title by which it is now best known.  Its publisher, William Heinemann Ltd, claimed on the jacket to the 1965 edition, \"This is now recognized as one of the greatest novels in the English language.\"  It was acclaimed for its rich characterizations and then-startling depiction of mental illness attacking an otherwise respectable person, while his much-younger wife, who does not think herself clever, must become resourceful with a high-level of uncomfortable capability. In recent years, it has been recognised as a graphic description of the onset and evolution of young onset dementia caused by neurosyphilis, the condition from which her father died. The book is based, at least in outline, on events in the life of Richardson's parents, Walter Lindesay Richardson and Mary Bailey, though it should not be considered a biography, as many major and minor changes were made.  The publisher originally balked at publishing the third volume (after the first two had modest sales) without persuasion from Richardson's husband.   Only when the third volume appeared was it hailed as a great novel. Ultima Thule  won the Australian Literature Society Gold Medal for 1929. An early American edition of the book contained an introduction by Sinclair Lewis in which he erroneously claimed that Richardson's true name was Henrietta, with no mention of Ethel.  A new 3-volume edition was released by Australian Scholarly Publishing in December 2007.  A new one-volume edition, with a new introduction by Peter Craven, was issued in Australia by Text Publishing in its Text Classics series in 2012."

It was addressed to American programmers and software organizations of the 1990s, warning that they were about to be driven out of business by programmers in other countries who could produce software more cheaply and with higher quality. Yourdon claimed that American software organizations could only retain their edge by using technologies such as ones he described in the book. (These are listed in the chapter outline below.) Yourdon gave examples of how non-American\u2014specifically Indian and Japanese\u2014companies were making use of these technologies to produce high-quality software. In the follow-up book Rise and Resurrection of the American Programmer, published in 1996, Yourdon reversed some of his original predictions based upon changes in the state of the software industry."

It was first published in 1802, but was expanded in several later editions, reaching its final state in 1830, two years before Scott's death.  It includes many of the most famous Scottish ballads, such as Sir Patrick Spens, The Young Tamlane, The Twa Corbies, The Douglas Tragedy, Clerk Saunders, Kempion, The Wife of Usher's Well, The Cruel Sister, The D\u00e6mon Lover, and Thomas the Rhymer.  Scott enlisted the help of several collaborators, notably John Leyden, and found his ballads both by field research of his own and by consulting the manuscript collections of others.  Controversially, in the editing of his texts he preferred literary quality over scholarly rigour, but Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border nevertheless attracted high praise from the first.  It was influential both in Britain and on the Continent, and helped to decide the course of Scott's later career as a poet and novelist.  In recent years it has been called \"the most exciting collection of ballads ever to appear.\""

The first Wilder version, 1938, entitled The Merchant of Yonkers, was faithful to the original material, but the second Wilder version, 1955, renamed The Matchmaker, expanded the previously secondary role of Dolly Gallagher Levi, who later became the heroine of the Jerry Herman musical hit, Hello, Dolly!. Stoppard's adaptation eliminates the Dolly character.

The poem is set in colonial Burma, then part of British India. The protagonist is a Cockney working-class soldier, back in grey restrictive London, recalling the time he felt free and had a Burmese girlfriend, now unattainably far away. The poem became well known, especially after it was set to music by Oley Speaks in 1907, and was admired by Kipling's contemporaries, though some of them objected to its muddled geography. It has been criticised as a \"vehicle for imperial thought\", but more recently has been defended by Kipling's biographer David Gilmour and others. Other critics have identified a variety of themes in the poem, including exotic erotica, Victorian prudishness, romanticism, class, power, and gender. The song, with Speaks's music, was sung by Frank Sinatra with alterations to the text, such as \"broad\" for \"girl\", which were disliked by Kipling's family. Bertolt Brecht's Mandalay Song, set to music by Kurt Weill, alludes to the poem."

It consists of a prologue and two articles: the first one was written in 1944 and appeared in number 115 of the review Sur; the second, written in 1946, is a rework of the first. Borges comments that he did not combine the two texts into one, as the reading of two analogous texts might facilitate the comprehension of an indocile subject. Just as subjective idealist George Berkeley denies that there is a material object existing independently of our perception of it, and David Hume denies that there is a subject apart from a mere recollection of sensations (a reductionist, materialist worldview), Borges tries to posit that there is no time. He proceeds on the assumption that if \"man\" is reduced, as according to Hume, to a collection of sensations, a single repeated perception, either in one man's life or in the experience of two different men, suffices to prove that time is a fallacy, since this repetition will destroy its linear sequence."

The book combined scientific data with color illustrations, accessible language, and personal experience reflecting Blanchan's joy in nature. In his introduction, naturalist John Burroughs praised it as \"reliable\" as well as \"written in a vivacious strain by a real bird lover.\" After discussing the scientific classification of birds by families, Blanchan lists 19 \"habitats\" where birds can be found (such as \"birds seen near the edges of woods\" and \"birds found near salt water\"), and groups the birds themselves by size and color. The 52 color illustrations were produced by photographing stuffed birds in front of appropriate backgrounds, since cameras of the time could not take good photographs of living birds. The published photographs were also limited by the color printing technologies of the time, and some of the darker birds have been described as looking like \"they had been dipped in shoe polish.\" Among the \"birds conspicuously black\" in the book is the red-winged blackbird, which is introduced this way: In oozy pastures where a brook lazily finds its way through the farm is the ideal pleasure ground of this \"bird of society.\" His notes, \"h'-wa-ker-ee\" or \"con-quer-ee\" (on an ascending scale), are liquid in quality, suggesting the sweet, moist, cool retreats where he nests\u00a0... satisfied with cut-worms, grubs, and insects, or with fruit and grain for his food\u00a0\u2013 the blackbird is an impressive and helpful example of how to get the best out of life. On publication, The New York Times praised the book's color prints and its ability to be \"understood by all readers,\" and the following year included it in a list of \"150 books for summer reading.\" Bird Neighbors sold over 250,000 copies, helping to make the author the best-selling female nature writer of her time. Originally published by Doubleday, the book was republished by the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation in 1999."

The book tells how, after ten years of unsuccessful psychotherapy, Bean discovers medical orgone therapy, a therapeutic intervention that focuses on renewing what it describes as \"energy flows\" within the patient, orgone being Wilhelm Reich's name for the \"life energy\". It is a strongly personal account of a man who gets a second chance at a personal sexual revolution, feeling his body beginning to change, feeling freer and more alive, and also seeing his relationships transformed. The book includes a foreword by Scottish educator A. S. Neill. It also contains information on the former Fifteenth Street School in New York City where Dr. Reich's concepts were applied to childhood education. According to a review in Time, Bean's account is \"clear and balanced\", discussing Reich's \"final tragic swerve toward insanity\" even as it \"over-insists\u00a0... his greatness.\" Me and the Orgone has been cited in several books on the topic of orgone energy, including Charles R. Kelley's Life Force: The Creative Process in Man and in Nature and investigative journalist Mary Coddington's Seekers of the Healing Energy, in which she described Me and the Orgone as a good source for understanding the workings of Reich's orgone therapy treatments.

It was licensed by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 25 May 1632 and was acted by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. It was printed in quarto in 1658 by the stationer Andrew Pennycuicke, who identified himself as \"one of the Actors\" in the play. A second edition followed in 1659. Pennycuicke dedicated the play (Massinger was long dead) to Ann, Countess of Oxford\u2014or at least most of the surviving copies bear a dedication to her; but others are dedicated to any one of four other individuals. No direct source for the play has been identified, other than Massinger's own earlier play, A New Way to Pay Old Debts, which was modelled on Thomas Middleton's A Trick to Catch the Old One. Specific connections have been cited between The City Madam and Shakespeare's Measure for Measure (regarding Sir John Frugal's pretended absence and masquerade), Ben Jonson's Volpone (Luke Frugal's rhapsodising over his wealth), and Rollo, Duke of Normandy (Stargaze's astrological verbiage), among other works. The City Madam was adapted into a version titled A Cure for Pride in 1675. The original version may have been revived in 1771, and was definitely performed in 1783 at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. A play founded on The City Madam, entitled Riches; or, The Wife and Brother, by Sir James Bland Burges, was brought out with success at the Lyceum in 1810."

Although it can be considered a romantic work, its romanticism is contained, moderate, without the sentimental excesses, the twists in the plot and the happy endings of the romantic genre. Moreover, it is also presented as a psychological novel \"that although it is not unheard of, it is rare in sentimental novels\" where the most important thing is not intrigue or action, \"but to study the character and his behavior\". It is Machado de Assis himself who makes it clear on the Notice of the first edition: \"I did not want to make a novel of manners: I tried to sketch a situation and contrast two characters; with those simple elements I looked for the interest of the book\". His idea was to put Shakespeare's thought into action:"

The story concerns the efforts of an Allied commando team to destroy a seemingly impregnable German fortress that threatens Allied naval ships in the Aegean Sea and prevents over 1,200 isolated British Army soldiers from being rescued. The Greek island of Navarone does not exist and the plot is fictional, but the story takes place within the real historical context of the 1943 Dodecanese campaign. The Guns of Navarone brings together elements that would characterise much of MacLean's subsequent works: tough, competent, worldly men as main characters; frequent but non-graphic violence; betrayal of the hero(es) by a trusted associate; and extensive use of the sea and other dangerous environments as settings. Its three principal characters \u2013 New Zealand mountaineer-turned-commando Keith Mallory, American demolitions expert \"Dusty\" Miller, and Greek resistance fighter Andrea \u2013 are among the most fully drawn in all of MacLean's work."

        "content": "Winterset is a play by Maxwell Anderson. A verse drama written largely in poetic form, the tragedy deals indirectly with the famous Sacco-Vanzetti case, in which two Italian immigrants with radical political beliefs were executed. Its plot follows Mio Romagna's quest to prove his father's innocence in the years after Bartolomeo Romagna was executed for a robbery and murder that he did not commit. Mio's quest is complicated by his love for Miriamne Esdras and the difficult ethical decisions that result from his connection with her family. A highly political play, with reflections on faith, truth, justice, love, and duty, it frequently alludes to William Shakespeare and Judaic philosophies. The Broadway production, produced and directed by Guthrie McClintic, opened on September 25, 1935, at the Martin Beck Theatre, where it ran for 195 performances. The cast included Burgess Meredith, Margo, and Eduardo Ciannelli. It won the first New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play. Meredith, Margo, and Ciannelli were joined by John Carradine, Stanley Ridges, and Mischa Auer in the film adaptation in 1936, directed by Alfred Santell. Anderson initially offered the play to The Group Theater with the stipulation that Meredith, a non-member, play the lead. Meredith wanted to join the group, but when asked during his interview by the three directors \"do you love the Group Theater above yourself?\", he said no. He was rejected, causing the playwright to withdraw his offer to the Group Theater. This incident became a source of contention among the group's actors. Members often cited it as an example of \"ill-advised dogma\"."

The jacket with the green lettering is the first state of the dustjacket (pictured right). Its lettering was rendered by Wisconsin artist Frank Utpatel. This state is the rarer of the two jackets, since a large number of the Utpatel jackets were destroyed by silverfish during storage.

        "content": "The Second Folio is the 1632 edition of the collected plays of William Shakespeare. It follows the First Folio of 1623. Much language was updated in the Second Folio and there are almost 1,700 changes. The major partners in the First Folio had passed from the publishing scene by the time of the Second Folio: William Jaggard\u2014official printer to the city of London (17 December 1610)\u2014had died in 1623, and his son Isaac died in 1627. Edward Blount, the third major partner, had sold his rights to Shakespearean plays to Robert Allot in 1630, and then died in 1632. Allot thus became the prime mover in the creation of the Second Folio. The two minor partners in the First Folio, William Aspley and John Smethwick, continued as partners in the Second Folio syndicate; Aspley owned the rights to Much Ado About Nothing and Henry IV, Part 2, while Smethwick owned the rights to Love's Labour's Lost, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and The Taming of the Shrew. Allot, Aspley, and Smethwick were joined by two other publishers: Richard Hawkins and Richard Meighen. (Hawkins owned the rights to Othello, while Meighen owned the rights to The Merry Wives of Windsor.) The printing of the Second Folio was done by Thomas Cotes. Individual copies of the Second Folio were issued with title-page inscriptions to each of the five publishers, in the format \"printed by Thomas Cotes for Robert Allot,\" \"...for William Aspley,\" etc. It appears that each of the booksellers in the syndicate took a specific consignment of the press run to sell at his shop, the size of the consignment depending upon his level of participation in the project. In all copies, though, a colophon at the end of the book gives the full list of publishers. By one account, the surviving volumes of the Second Folio inscribed for Robert Allot outnumber those for the other four publishers taken altogether, by about two to one \u2014 a fact that reflects Allot's dominance in the endeavour. The Hawkins imprint is \"exceedingly rare,\" and \"Not more than three or four copies are known with the Smethwick imprint....\" Though all copies of the Second Folio are dated 1632, some in fact are remainder issues that were released as late as 1641 and after. Among the prefatory matter is the first published poem by John Milton, printed anonymously, \"An Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\". King Charles I owned a copy of the Second Folio, which became part of the library of Windsor Castle; Charles II's copy is in the British Library. The so-called Perkins Folio, which John Payne Collier used for his forged emendations of Shakespeare's text, was a copy of the Second Folio."

Bryson's trip begins in the winter, in Hammerfest, Norway, where his goal is to see the Northern Lights. He visits numerous locations throughout Europe, commenting on the various aspects of life in different parts of Europe, and comparing them to how he experienced them in his earlier visits. The book ends with Bryson reaching Istanbul, Turkey, looking across the Bosphorus to Asia, and considering continuing his tour."

It tells how a group of leading French citizens, men and women included, joined together to form an unusual group, The Society of Mutual Autopsy, with the aim of proving that souls do not exist. The idea was that, after death, they would dissect each other and (hopefully) show a direct relationship between brain shapes and sizes and the character, abilities and intelligence of individuals. The book argues that this strange scientific pact, and anthropology itself, which the group's members helped to develop, had its genesis in aggressive, evangelical atheism. Essentially, The End of the Soul is a study of science and atheism in France in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. It illustrates how anthropology grew in the context of an impassioned struggle between the forces of tradition, especially the Catholic faith, and those of a more freethinking modernism, and posits that it became for many a secular religion. Among the figures discussed are novelist \u00c9mile Zola, statesman Leon Gambetta, American birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, and Arthur Conan Doyle. The End of the Soul received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award for 2004 from the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a book that \"is an important contribution to knowledge, serious scholarship with a broad pertinence to the human condition.\""

From his experiences he wrote Command Decision as a stage play in 1945 but was unable to sell it. He followed suggestions that he first publish it in novel form and the book became both a best-seller and critical success. Dialogue describing the infighting to build strategic airpower over the two decades preceding U.S. participation in World War II, particularly spoken by General Kane, are thinly disguised versions of actual events and personages.

In the book, Klein argues that neoliberal free market policies (as advocated by the economist Milton Friedman) have risen to prominence in some developed countries because of a deliberate strategy of \"shock therapy\". This centers on the exploitation of national crises (disasters or upheavals) to establish controversial and questionable policies, while citizens are too distracted (emotionally and physically) to engage and develop an adequate response, and resist effectively. The book advances the idea that some man-made events, such as the Iraq War, were undertaken with the intention of pushing through such unpopular policies in their wake. Some reviewers criticized the book for making what they viewed as simplifications of political phenomena, while others lauded it as a compelling and important work. The book served as the main source of a 2009 documentary feature film with the same title directed by Michael Winterbottom."

It was first published in hardcover in London by Cassell and Company, Ltd. in May 1932, and was reprinted in 1934. The first American edition was issued by Sheridan House in 1937. While the fictional narrator of this novel never refers to himself by name, the British first edition is subtitled \"A Kai Lung story\", and the American edition has the title The Return of Kai Lung. Unlike the other books by Bramah, it is a true novel rather than a string of short stories. The queue of the mandarin T'sin Wong has mysteriously vanished while he slept. The maiden Hwa-che seeks to solve the mystery, using the methods she has learned from the crime novels of the Western barbarians. In this she is aided by Chin-tung, the mandarin's male secretary. Initially disguised as a man, she and Chin-tung become increasingly attracted to each other as the story progresses. The story humorously spoofs the conventions of the mystery novel, and contains allusions to well known fictional detectives. Readers will catch allusions to Sherlock Holmes, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Hercule Poirot, among others. As with Bramah's other Chinese stories, much of the humor is also derived from a mock \"Chinese\" re-phrasing of common English expressions."

The Prussian cult of the uniform ensures that the townspeople are all-too willing to obey his orders, in stark contrast to the treatment the protagonist was given before he donned the uniform.

This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC's 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger renewable energy policy coverage. In the present time, there is an obvious trend to have more renewable energy sources and therefore to overcome life crisis that can go when oil and gas expire. Renewable energy can contribute to \"social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts\".

It also concerns the political state of France. Voltaire aimed to be the French Virgil, outdoing the master by preserving Aristotelian unity of place\u2014a property of classical tragedy rather than epic\u2014by keeping the human action confined between Paris and Ivry.  It was first printed (under the title La Ligue) in 1723, and reprinted dozens of times within Voltaire's lifetime."

Zhang's Return to the Field is a seminal work in the Fields and Gardens poetry genre which helped to sparked centuries of poetic enthusiasm for poems of various forms which share a common theme of nature foremost with human beings and human thought seemingly not in main focus, somewhat similar to the Landscape poetry genre; however, in the case of the Fields and Gardens genre, nature was focused upon in its more domestic manifestation, paying homage to the appearance of nature in gardens, as found in backyards, and cultivated in the countryside. Return to the Field also invokes traditional themes of Classical Chinese poetry involving nature versus society."

        "content": "London is a poem by Samuel Johnson, produced shortly after he moved to London. Written in 1738, it was his first major published work. The poem in 263 lines imitates Juvenal's Third Satire, expressed by the character of Thales as he decides to leave London for Wales. Johnson imitated Juvenal because of his fondness for the Roman poet and he was following a popular 18th-century trend of Augustan poets headed by Alexander Pope that favoured imitations of classical poets, especially for young poets in their first ventures into published verse. London was published anonymously and in multiple editions during 1738. It quickly received critical praise, notably from Pope. This would be the second time that Pope praised one of Johnson's poems; the first being for Messiah, Johnson's Latin translation of Pope's poem. Part of that praise comes from the political basis of the poem. From a modern view, the poem is outshined by Johnson's later poem The Vanity of Human Wishes, as well as works like his A Dictionary of the English Language, his Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets, and his periodical essays for The Rambler, The Idler and The Adventurer."

        "content": "Letty Fox: Her Luck is Australian-born author Christina Stead\u2019s sixth novel. It is a tribute to the drama of the urban environment and its role in socializing its occupants.  Published in 1946, Stead wrote the lengthy Letty Fox after living in New York City for seven years.  The cosmopolitan setting serves well as the theater in which Stead develops her characters through their adventures with numerous careers, love affairs, familial obligations, and sensitivities to reputation.   To this end, Letty Fox has been described as \u201ca modern picaresque novel and psychological novel at the same time.\u201d In a break from her typical style of story-telling, Christina Stead wrote Letty Fox from the first person perspective.  The novel's protagonist narrator, Letty Fox, reveals herself as a bundle of contradictions.  While Letty is a shrewd observer of human behavior, her perceptions and reactions are in various instances romantic, conservative, and feminist.   Stead introduces the reader to Letty at the restless age of 24 with the following mise en sc\u00e8ne: One hot night last spring, after waiting fruitlessly for a call from my then lover, with whom I had quarreled the same afternoon, and finding one of my black moods on me, I flung out of my lonely room on the ninth floor (unlucky number) in a hotel in lower Fifth Avenue and rushed into the streets of the Village, feeling bad.  My first thought was, at any cost, to get company for the evening. This beginning hints at Letty's capacity to be sexually frank, along with her steadfast desire to act with commonsense. While major political events, such as the economic depression and World War II, provide setting for Letty Fox: Her Luck, the reader finds that the story devotes itself to the psychological development of its main character.  In what Rudolf Bader has referred to as a \u201cone long bildungsroman,\u201d Stead wrote Letty Fox as a colossally comic coming-of-age, wherein readers are introduced to the colorful personalities that shaped the heroine's young life.  Letty gains wisdom through lessons bestowed by her unusual family and her numerous unsuccessful relationships with unsuitable men, including her passionate mania for Luke Adams (\u201ca tease, a hound of love\u201d).  Stead ends the novel when Letty rejects a life of scattered sexual aggression, in favor of the stability of marriage. Letty's decision to marry her friend, Bill van Week, has been interpreted by literary critics as an acceptance of the sexual economics that dominate middle-class male/female relationships at the time.  However, that is not to suggest that Stead's reputation as a writer lacks a feminist perspective.  On the contrary, through the character of Letty, Stead portrays a complex woman struggling inside of the patriarchal structures that confine her to a particular world.  Letty's choice to marry and have a child - because she is \u201ctired of steering\u201d in a sea of men - may be viewed as Stead's criticism of a society that strictly limits female experience.   Like many of Stead's female characters, the fictionalized women of Letty Fox: Her Luck are conscious of the ways in which the male capitalist culture dominates them.  At least one critic has judged Letty as \u201ca heartless betrayer,\u201d who borrows from and champions the suppressive ideology of power, exploiting others to achieve her goals.  Or, maybe Letty just gets lucky."

While this is only four months, the text is nearly as long as the three earlier volumes together. Although the humorous writing is similar, there are no ersatz communiques and almost no sketches; the photographs are fewer and smaller. Losing patience with criticism about his veracity, the preface reads, \"I\u2019ve spent a fortune on beer and dinners interviewing my old Battery mates, and phone calls to those overseas ran into over a hundred pounds.\" Also, \"I wish the reader to know that he is not reading a tissue of lies and fancies, it all really happened.\" (Following this book Milligan was even more upset, by comments from the people he wrote about. His manager Norma Farnes wrote that she thought the next volume would never be written on their account.) Farnes wrote that Milligan's diary was kept daily, except when the fighting was too fierce but there are also days when he is too sick or bored to write. Sometimes the diaries of others supplement Milligan's in the text."

Published in 1985, the book continues a pattern of Wambaugh crime fiction beginning with The Choirboys that uses black humor to explore the psychological effects of prolonged stress on veteran police officers. As with all his novels, The Secrets of Harry Bright, set in November 1984, is contemporaneous with the time frame in which it was written and includes numerous allusions and references to events and personalities of the time. The Secrets of Harry Bright also continued Wambaugh's satirization of the mores and extravagances of the Southern California \"rich and famous\" lifestyle that began with The Black Marble, in addition to its focus on police work. The novel, set in and around Palm Springs, California, savages a wealthy \"occasional home\" mentality characterized by golf, excessive drinking and drug use, and discriminatory country clubs. Wambaugh draws contrasts by depicting the fictional Mineral Springs, a small wind-swept desert town populated not just by blue-collar tourist industry workers, but \"ex-cons, bikers, crank dealers, Palm Springs burglars, nudists, robbers and pimps, horny kite pilots, dopers and drunks.\" The Secrets of Harry Bright first appeared on the New York Times best seller list on October 6, 1985, ranked 15th, and rose as high as 5th.

The book is a firsthand account, written by Tim Guest at the age of 27,  years after his experiences. The book was published in 2004 by Granta Books. The book's title is a reference to the term \"the orange people\", which was used to refer to members of the Rajneesh movement due to the color they dyed their clothes. Guest describes how his mother was initially raised in strict Catholicism, but later turned to a tape of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh after going through a period of experimenting with sex and drugs. She dyed all of her clothes orange, took on the name of \"Ma Prem Vismaya\", and \"Yogesh\" for her son, and moved to a Rajneesh movement commune near Bombay. Guest's mother moved to many different communes, and had leadership roles within the movement, eventually running a commune in Suffolk. Guest recounts how he regretted the absence of his mother's presence during this time, and describes controversial living conditions with other children at the various ashrams. Guest and his mother moved to the  commune in Oregon, but his mother was demoted in position and sent to live at a different commune in Cologne. His family later disassociated from the Rajneesh movement and moved back to North London, where they each encountered difficulties reintegrating back into mainstream society. My Life in Orange received generally positive reviews, and was highlighted in a \"Top 20 non-fiction\" list by The Daily Telegraph, and a \"50 Best Books for the Beach\" by The Independent. Kirkus Reviews called the book \"a rightly disturbing record of malignant child neglect by people who sought a heaven, but made a hell\", and William Leith of New Statesman described it as \"an excellent study of what happens when a charismatic leader comes into contact with a group of rudderless, dispirited people\". Publishers Weekly called it \"an absorbing book about survival and good intentions gone awry\"."

        "content": "Lies Across America, a 1999 book by James Loewen, is a sequel to his 1995 work Lies My Teacher Told Me. The book focuses on historical markers and museums across the United States, arguing that every historic site is \"a tale of two eras\": the one from when the event happened and the one from when the event was commemorated. The survey starts on the West Coast and moves east, a deliberate break from the traditional American history found in textbooks, which begin with the Pilgrims and follow westward expansion. In the book, Loewen prioritized Native American history and the Spanish colonization of the Americas over that of other European colonization. Loewen's book voices two major complaints about historical markers in the United States. The first deals with historical markers established in the Southern United States that attempt to whitewash the history of slavery and the period of Reconstruction. Many of these markers were established between 1890 and 1920, the nadir of American race relations. Most were placed by organizations with pro-Confederate agendas and reflect the racism of the early 20th century. While some markers have been altered in the last 40 years as a result of civil rights progress, many have not, especially those at American Civil War battle sites and in the South. Loewen's second major complaint deals with the treatment of Native Americans, who are often neglected and omitted in the telling of American history. The author challenges and corrects many of the inaccurate and Eurocentric mistruths spread by historical markers across America. At the end of his book, Loewen makes suggestions for how those concerned about the misrepresentation of history can change markers and monuments to convey historical truth and accuracy. The organizations running historical sites are faulted in Loewen's book according to Wilton Corkern."

The Green Collar Economy is the first environmental book written by an African-American to make the New York Times bestseller list. The book is a detailed proposal for a \"green new deal\". Jones describes the opportunity to create thousands of low- and medium-skill jobs that help conserve energy (for example, insulating older homes and buildings) or use alternate energy sources (solar panels). He emphasizes that these would be local jobs that could not be exported.  With appropriate incentives and programs, the jobs could be created in inner cities and thereby help lift people out of poverty.  According to Jones, Americans can ensure the \"approaching green wave lifts all boats,\" and calls for a mass movement to tackle the United States' ecological and economic crises."

It was written by Bancroft Prize-winning historian Robert Dallek, a prominent History professor at Boston University.  The author is a presidential historian who taught at Columbia University and UCLA prior to accepting his professorial role in Boston, and was the author of nearly two-dozen books. Dallek researched JFK for five years, using National Security Archives, oral histories, White House tapes, and medical records in his preparations. Dallek contends that historians have underestimated JFK's achievements, especially in regards to his impressive accomplishments in foreign policy, including his averting nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis and his early steps towards detente with the Soviet Union, which began with his Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of August 5, 1963. JFK was part of a prominent Boston family that would acquire great wealth and had held political office for two prior generations.  The death of JFK's older brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. during World War II eventually paved the way for his political career.  His wealthy diplomat father Joseph P. Kennedy was heavily involved in his political career, and both helped to finance his campaigns, and arrange effective public relations efforts through his contacts in the press and other media.  Other family members, particularly his brother Robert helped in early campaign efforts.  In the mid-1950s, after defeating Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., leaving the United States House of Representatives, and getting elected as a U.S. Senator, he was one step closer to becoming president. Dallek recounted Kennedy's medical problems which were controlled by drugs including antispasmodics and antibiotics. He used painkillers for his chronic back pain and other medication to treat his Addison's disease. He sometimes took up to eight medications a day.  A committee of three Kennedy associates refused to provide his medical records for decades, but they decided to give Dallek access to them; although the book does not have a complete record of his medical history."

It is a black comedy set in Soho, a fast-paced gangster plot that tells the story of this particular night club's culture. Would-be rock 'n' roll star 'Silver Johnny' is on the  road to fame and fortune during the summer of 1958, but encounters problems with his jealous manager, Ezra, the owner of the Atlantic Club, who is hell-bent on protecting him from the amorous advances of creepy local gangster/entrepreneur Sam Ross. Skinny, a member of Johnny's group, and one of the club's pill-popping employees, discovers Ezra sawn in half in separate dustbins, and Ezra's ambitious associate Mickey announces that Ross intends to take over the Atlantic Club. The original cast was Hans Matheson (Silver Johnny), Tom Hollander (Baby), Aidan Gillen (Skinny), Matt Bardock (Sweets), David Westhead (Mickey), and Andy Serkis (Potts).

Like the previous novel in the series (Colour Scheme) the story takes place during World War II with Alleyn doing counter-espionage work.  The format of the book is somewhat unusual, in that Alleyn does not arrive at the scene of the murder until fifteen months after it has taken place, and much of his detecting is founded upon stories told him by the chief witnesses in the case."

The novel is set in Southern France, where Alleyn, his painter wife Agatha Troy and their young son Ricky are holidaying, although Alleyn is also tasked by his Scotland Yard superiors with meeting French police colleagues to discuss international drug trafficking through Marseilles. On the overnight sleeper train from Paris, the Alleyns witness what appears to be a fatal night-time stabbing in the illuminated window of a dramatically-set mediaeval castle overlooking the railway line. This proves to be the resort of an \u00e9lite, louche group of socialites who are dabbling in Black Magic under the auspices of a smoothly dubious host and 'high priest' of a cult that clearly involves recreational drug-taking, with vulnerable wealthy women potentially exploited. Alleyn's investigations are complicated by the kidnapping of Ricky from their hotel. The novel revisits similar themes to Marsh's earlier Alleyn mystery novel Death in Ecstasy (1936), which also concerns a suspect cult with drug-taking a part of its practice and a dubiously charismatic cult leader, although the earlier book is set in fashionable London society, not Southern France. According to Marsh's biographer Margaret Lewis, in writing both novels, Marsh drew on her knowledge of an actual 1890s scandal in her native Christchurch NZ: Arthur Bently Worthington's Temple of Truth. Lewis also says (page 147) that Marsh based the sinister chateau on a French Saracen fortress where her lifelong friends, the Rhodes family, holidayed in 1949. The novel was published in the United States in 1953 (by Little Brown of Boston, her usual American publisher) and in 1955 in an abridged edition titled The Bride of Death (by Spivak of New York)."

Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin\u2014a relief from the drudgery of writing\u2014developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids. The book was his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection, and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the coevolution of orchids and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced botanists, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by cross-fertilisation. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. Orchids was the first in a series of books on his innovative investigations into plants. The book describes how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant that there must be a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar."

        "content": "The Gathering Storm is a fantasy novel by American writers Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, the twelfth book in the series The Wheel of Time.  It was incomplete when Jordan died on September 16, 2007, from cardiac amyloidosis. His widow Harriet McDougal and his publisher Tom Doherty chose  Sanderson to continue the book. Jordan originally intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of Light. However, when Sanderson began writing the book, it became clear that a single volume would be too large to print. The expected final book was split into three volumes: The Gathering Storm, Towers of Midnight, and A Memory of Light. The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, The Gathering Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat. The three books comprise what can be considered Jordan's final vision of the series. In the foreword, Sanderson states that they can be thought of as \"the three volumes of A Memory of Light or as the final three books of The Wheel of Time. Both are correct.\" He also comments on the differing writing style, suggesting that it could be compared to different film directors directing the same script. The Gathering Storm consists of a prologue, 50 chapters, and an epilogue."

The book is organized into six chapters drawn from each of the six lectures. Each chapter of the book addresses one question regarding the writer\u2019s position and craft. The book also includes a prologue and an introduction entitled \"Into the labyrinth\" in which she describes the process of creating this particular work.

Set in the early 1980s, it follows two plots, through which Banks explores the relationship between apparently distant people drawn together in the world under globalization, which Banks compares to the geologic phenomenon of continental drift. The first plot features Bob DuBois, a working class New Englander who heads to Florida in the hopes of striking it rich; the second plot traces the journey of Vanise Dorsinville from Haiti to Florida. It is an avowedly political work, whose stated aim is to \"destroy the world as it is.\" Despite its scope, it is according to critic Michiko Kakutani \"somehow, acutely personal.\" The book sold well (15,000 copies in hard cover, 100,000 in paper-back) and was highly acclaimed by critics. After publishing Continental Drift, Banks won the Dos Passos Prize for Literature."

There is no doubt that Euripides transformed Caranus to Archelaus (meaning \"leader of the people\") in the play, in an attempt to please Archelaus I of Macedon.  In the play, Archelaus son of Temenus was exiled from Argos by his brothers and went to Thrace, to king Cisseus who happened to be at war with neighbouring people and promised Archelaus his kingdom and daughter if he could protect him against the enemies. Archelaus did it and went to ask the king for his promised reward. The king however broke his promise and decided to kill Archelaus by treachery. He therefore gave orders to prepare a pitfall to trap him. But a slave of the king told Archelaus about the plot and the hero asked for a secret interview with the king: when alone he threw him inside the pitfall. He then fled to Macedonia, led by a goat, according to some command of Apollo, and founded the city of Aigai after the goat. From the main play only fragments have been saved. The works Alcmene, Temenus, Temenidai and Archelaus were part of the Macedonian tetralogy of Euripides."

It was published in 1944, and in it, she makes a philosophical inquiry into the human situation by way of analogy from the story of when Pyrrhus was asked by his friend Cineas what his plans were after conquering his next empire. Cineas's question is a sort of infinite regress (\"and then what?\") that only stops when Pyrrhus admits that after the last conquest, he will rest. Upon receiving this answer, Cineas asks why Pyrrhus doesn't rest now instead of going through all the trouble of conquering all these other empires when the final result will be rest anyway. According to Beauvoir, Cineas's question haunts all of our projects, and we will always have to give an answer to it. The authentic answer, as she sees it, goes contrary to traditional interpretations in which Cineas is considered the wiser of the two. Pyrrhus's attitude is considered more authentic in that it is an attitude that directs itself forwards towards goals that are never absolute: According to Beauvoir, the reason for Pyrrhus's final statement that in the end, he is going to rest, is that he lacks imagination."

As the title suggests, it commemorates and eulogises the life and actions of the Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace who lived a century and a half earlier. The poem is historically inaccurate, and mentions several events that never happened.  For several hundred years following its publication, The Wallace was the second most popular book in Scotland after the Bible. The earliest extant text is a copy made by John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell in 1488, but that copy has no title page and last few pages are missing, with no mention of Blind Harry as its author. The first mention of Blind Harry as the work's author was made by John Mair in his 1521 work Historia Majoris Britanniae, tam Angliae quam Scotiae. It was later republished in the late 18th century by the poet William Hamilton, in contemporary English. This version also went through over 20 editions, with the last published in 1859. The poem was used by screenwriter Randall Wallace to write his script for Braveheart (1995)."

The focus of the book is the challenge scientists face in communicating to the general public in an age of information-overload.

After the first scene, which takes place on a ship at sea during a tempest, the rest of the story is set on a remote island, where the sorcerer Prospero, a complex and contradictory character, lives with his daughter Miranda, and his two servants: Caliban, a savage monster figure, and Ariel, an airy spirit. The play contains music and songs that evoke the spirit of enchantment on the island. It explores many themes, including magic, betrayal, revenge, and family. In Act IV, a wedding masque serves as a play-within-a-play, and contributes spectacle, allegory, and elevated language. Although The Tempest is listed in the First Folio as the first of Shakespeare's comedies, it deals with both tragic and comic themes, and modern criticism has created a category of romance for this and others of Shakespeare's late plays. The Tempest has been put to varied interpretations, from those that see it as a fable of art and creation, with Prospero representing Shakespeare, and Prospero's renunciation of magic signaling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage, to interpretations that consider it an allegory of Europeans colonizing foreign lands."

It follows the winding history of science and its exploration of human sexuality, going back as far as Aristotle and finally ending with recent discoveries about the origination and anatomy of the female orgasm. Throughout, Mary Roach provides a humorous and often very personal view\u2014both as a participant and observer\u2014of humans, scientists, animals, and sex machines. Of the book's numerous accounts, Roach discusses artificial insemination of sows in Denmark, the notorious history of sex machines, as well as providing commentary on Kinsey's notorious attic sex experiments. Her footnotes provide additional humor: as in a sentence that includes several DSM diagnoses listed as acronyms, she adds, \"And from HAFD (hyperactive acronym formation disorder)\". In the book, Roach describes a session in which she and her husband, Ed, volunteer to have sex while being recorded by a groundbreaking 4D ultrasound, in the interests of science. During the experiment, a doctor looks on, making suggestions, and finally telling Ed that he \"may ejaculate now\". In 2008, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, was a New York Times Top 10 Bestseller as well as a New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice; it was a San Francisco Chronicle #1 bestseller and made it to the Boston Sunday Globe\u2032s Top 5 Science Books. Bonk was also a Booksense Independent Bestseller and the Publishers Weekly 2008 Staff Pick. In an interview with D. J. Grothe, Roach observed about her book tour audiences for Bonk: \"It takes a while for the first person to raise a hand, but once one person has asked a question about sex, then you get ten people raising their hand and asking fairly explicit questions. And I do get the sense that it's kind of liberating for people to be able to just talk freely and ask questions using those words\u2014it's the words themselves\u2014I think everybody should just spend an hour just saying: 'clitoris, masturbation, penis, penis, penis, clitoris, clitoris'\u2014just saying it over and over until it doesn't sound strange. Because eventually, it becomes like any other word. And some people are there already, of course, but for some people, it just feels kind of scary to say those words in a public setting with strangers\"."

The libretto was commissioned by Scottish Opera, and first used in Glasgow on 23 October 1985, in a performance conducted by Sir Alexander Gibson and directed by Graham Vick, with production design by Russell Craig. Although the composer was German, the original libretto by James Robinson Planch\u00e9 is also in English, and included in the book. Complaints about Planch\u00e9's libretto have been common over the years, with Donald Tovey going so far as to call it a \"pig-trough\"; in performance it has usually been replaced with the German version by Theodor Hell. In August 2004, Scottish Opera staged several of Weber's operas, including Oberon (on 18 August), shortly before disbanding its chorus in order to meet budget cuts. However, Burgess's libretto was not used. One critic observed that: Perhaps not surprisingly, Scottish Opera has not volunteered to revive its 1985 production of Oberon at Edinburgh. This version was commissioned from the novelist Anthony Burgess, who not only replaced the archaic expressions and ersatz Shakespeare of Planch\u00e9's original, but also updated the story to involve hijackers and hostages in a futuristic Middle East. A staging that parked an aeroplane on the roof of Glasgow's Theatre Royal on the opening night only seemed to sink the already preposterous plot further into the mire, although Burgess was so taken with the music that he went on to arrange the overture to Oberon for guitar quartet. A year later, Frank Dunlop, in the third of the Edinburgh Festivals he directed, created an imaginative semi-staging of the opera on a tilting disc erected on the platform of the Usher Hall."

The piece is structured in the style of a Ballad-opera, with songs and choruses, and also has music underlying dialogue, like a melodrama. Pocahontas persuades her father, King Powhatan, to free Smith and becomes attracted to John Rolfe, breaking off her arranged marriage with a neighboring tribal prince, an action that leads to war. Her tribe wins the war, but her father loses trust in the white settlers; Pocahontas warns the settlers who reconcile with Powhatan. Several comic romances end happily, and Smith predicts a great future for the new country. The play deals with relations between Native Americans and the first European settlers in America. Scholars have debated whether the piece is progressive in its depiction of the natives and have commented that the work reflects an emerging American dramatic and musical sensibility. It served to popularize and romanticize the Pocahontas story as an important American myth. The comedy was first performed in 1808 at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. It has been cited as the first play about American Indians by an American playwright known to be produced on a professional stage, and possibly the first play produced in America to be then performed in England, although the validity of both statements has been questioned. Its portrayal of Native Americans has been criticized as racially insensitive, but the piece is credited with inspiring a whole new genre of plays about Pocahontas specifically and Native Americans in general, that was prevalent throughout the 19th and early 20th Century. The play was subsequently produced throughout the country."

Around 1994, Chilean writer Alberto Fuguet participated in an International Writer's Workshop which took place at the University of Iowa. There Fuguet attempted to present a short-story to the Iowa Review for publication. As the works of Latino authors were very popular at the time, Fuguet believed his chances of getting his works translated and published were quite high. However, upon reading Fuguet's work, the editor was convinced that the lack of magical realist or fantastical components in the narrative made it seem as if, \"the story could have taken place right there in [North] America.\" Consequently, the story was rejected on the grounds that 'it was not Latin American enough'. In response to the rejection of North American editors, a short-story anthology was compiled dawning the title McOndo. Edited and introduced by Alberto Fuguet and Sergio G\u00f3mez, the anthology of new Latin American literature was first published in Spain in 1996. The work compiled 17 short stories written by authors, all of whom were from either Latin America or Spain. All of the contributors were males who had primarily commenced their literary careers in the 1990s and all were born after the late 1950s. The contributing authors distanced themselves from the magical realism genre as they believed it did not correctly represent modern Latin America, which in the 1990s was full of \"shopping malls, cable television, suburbs, and pollution\". Alternately, the authors wished to focus on the erasure of nations, borders and geographical identities as a result of expanding transnational networks while exploring the effects of globalization on economy and culture. In one essay, Fuguet railed against the picturesque, exotic stereotypes that the publishing world had come to expect of Latin writers, citing well-known Cuban author-exile Reinaldo Arenas's pronouncement that the literary world expected Latin American novelists to tackle only two themes: underdevelopment and exoticism. Fuguet wrote that he does not deny that there are picturesque, colourful, or quaint aspects to Latin America, but that the world he lives in is too complicated and urban to be bound by the rules of magical realism. In the end, the primary focus of the anthology was the introduction, which was considered to be more in the vein of an essay rather than a literary work."

A deep blue ocean is sucking him under; misty red faces are swirling like shadows around him; and a girl with blue eyes as wide as the ocean is commanding him back to life. Against all the odds he survives - but with an almost total loss of memory. He does not even know himself. And that is not all. At night he is tormented by visions, in the daytime by hostile strangers. Why does he have so many enemies? And who is the strange child who seems to have a story to tell him? Something has happened in this town, something terrifying. Will can sense it but he can't work out what it was. Perhaps the old Will knew. But that was before the accident. The new Will must search for the answers again - and this is a dangerous task. For the town has a secret and there are those who will do everything in their power to preserve it. Even kill."

The book was written and published in Amsterdam when Linnaeus was twenty-eight and dedicated to the botanist Johannes Burman (1707\u20131779). The first edition appeared in 1735 with the full title Bibliotheca Botanica recensens libros plus mille de plantis huc usque editos secundum systema auctorum naturale in classes, ordines, genera et species; it was an elaborate classification system for his catalogue of books. The Preface, dated 8 August 1735, on pages 2\u201319 contains Linnaeus's extended account of botanical history in the form of a botanical analogy; in pages 2\u20133 Linnaeus lists previous bibliographers and then gives his account of botanical history leading to a golden age lasting from 1683 to 1703 (see also Incrementa Botanices, Biuur 1753 and Reformatio Botanices, Reftelius, 1762, for other historical notes by Linnaeus). The Preface mentions that Bibliotheca Botanica was the first part of a planned Bibliotheca medica (which he did not produce). A digest of Bibliotheca Botanica, which elaborated on the first chapter of the Fundamenta Botanica, is given in Aphorisms 5\u201352 of the Philosophia Botanica."

        "content": "De libero arbitrio voluntatis (On Free Choice of the Will), often shortened to De libero arbitrio, is a book by Augustine of Hippo which seeks to resolve the problem of evil in Christianity by asserting that free will is the cause of all suffering. The first of its three volumes was completed in 388; the second and third were written between 391 and 395. The work is structured as a dialogue between Augustine and his companion Evodius; it ranges over several topics, and includes an attempted proof of the existence of God. Intended as a refutation of Manichaeism, De libero arbitrio denied God's responsibility for sin and emphasised human freedom and accountability. As a result, it became associated with Pelagianism, another doctrine which Augustine considered heretical; he subsequently defended the work by softening its libertarian message. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas expanded on the political ideas expressed in this book, and is credited with popularising Augustine's claim that an unjust law is not a law."

In one cave, thousands of years of history are played out. A history marked by conformity and the persecution of anyone who dares to speak out. One family struggles to live their day-to-day lives. Then one day a young girl enters the cave and throws their belief system into question. This unsettling and powerful play, from the author of Gormenghast, is a dark, inquisitive look at the role of the artist in society, the nature of authority and its effect on the human condition. The Cave will be published by Methuen in a Mervyn Peake collection in 2011 to celebrate the centenary of Peake's birth."

The book describes how the deregulation of the financial industry and the systemic incentives for managers to \"loot\" limited liability companies led to the build-up and eventual collapse of the credit bubble during the 2000s. Smith argues that free market economists hold much of the blame for the 2008 financial crisis due to their outsized (and unchecked) influence over policy makers. In particular, she takes issue with faux empirical approaches used by economists and the masking of complex social phenomenon in simple mathematical equations, based on assumptions that are openly acknowledged to be wrong or in error. The book makes the case that overreliance on the assumption of a 'self-correcting' free market led to a period of unregulated speculation, accounting tricks, and public looting."

King Frederick William I of Prussia built the Palais Schulenburg, at Wilhelmstra\u00dfe 77, for his esteemed Lieutenant General Count Adolph Friedrich von der Schulenburg. Later the Palais had a more distinguished owner, Prince Anton Radziwill, a Polish nobleman, aristocrat, musician and politician in Prussia.

In 1875, the feuding Radziwill heirs sold the Palais to the German Reich. It became the Reichskanzlerpalais, the Chancellery of Otto von Bismarck and subsequent German Chancellors, the last being Adolf Hitler. Though Hitler lived in the old Chancellery when he was in Berlin, he ordered the building of a larger, grander structure, the New Reich Chancellery, completed January 1939. Hitler's Reich Chancellery was not only a center of government but, in Winston Churchill\u2019s words, the hub of  \u201ca monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime.\u201d In April 1945, as the Soviet Red Army closed in, Hitler and his mistress, Eva Braun, committed suicide together in the F\u00fchrerbunker, which Hitler had built under the Chancellery garden."

The book tells the story of a minor poet, Cecil Valance, who is killed in the First World War. In 1913, he visits a Cambridge friend, George Sawle, at the latter's home in Stanmore, Middlesex. While there Valance writes a poem entitled \"Two Acres\", about the Sawles' house and addressed, ambiguously, either to George himself or to George's younger sister, Daphne. The poem goes on to become famous and the novel follows the changing reputation of Valance and his poetry in the following decades. The phrase \"the stranger's child\" comes from the poem In Memoriam A.H.H. by  Alfred, Lord Tennyson: \"And year by year the landscape grow / Familiar to the stranger's child.\" In an interview with The Oxonian Review in 2012, Hollinghurst commented of the epigraph that \"[t]he music of the words is absolutely wonderful, marvellously sad and consoling all at once.

It was written by the American anthropologist and folklorist Sabina Magliocco of California State University, Northridge and first published in 2004 by the University of Pennsylvania Press. It was released as a part of a series of academic books titled 'Contemporary Ethnography', edited by the anthropologists Kirin Narayan of the University of Wisconsin and Paul Stoller of West Chester University. Magliocco became interested in studying the American Pagan movement in the mid-1990s, following the culmination of her fieldwork research in a Sicilian village. From 1995 through to 1997, she began studying the Pagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, joining a Wiccan group, the Coven Trismegiston, which was led by the high priest Don Frew and high priestess Anna Korn. Becoming involved with the faith, Magliocco noted that she no longer remained an objective outsider, but became an active participant after experiencing altered states of consciousness during several Pagan rituals. In 2002 she published her first book on the subject, Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work, which was followed by the more general Witching Culture two years later. Witching Culture provides an anthropological study of the Wiccan and wider Pagan community in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on the role that folklore has within the movement; in this it looks both at how Pagans have adopted pre-existing folklore and how unique Pagan folklore actually develops within the community. It deals with the influence of folkloristic on the early development of Wicca, in particular the influence of figures like Sir James Frazer, Charles Leland and Margaret Murray. The reviews published in specialist academic journals were predominantly positive, with James R. Lewis and Jacqueline Simpson being particularly praiseworthy, although some reviewers opined that Magliocco's openly Pagan beliefs had some negative repercussions for the study."

It follows the adventures of several characters centring on a fictional aircraft manufacturing plant near Ponca City, Oklahoma during World War II, specifically from 1942 to 1945. The plant chiefly produces the fictional B-30 Pax bomber. It is Crowley's first novel after the completion of his \u00c6gypt Sequence, and marks a turning in his style from the historically speculative series to  historical realism. The novel deals with the manufacturing and war industries during World War II, but rather than dealing with the most able-bodied during this period, the novel takes up the story of minority groups, the disabled, and many others still awaiting rights of full citizenship taking an active role in America. In his Afterword, Crowley explicitly theorizes that the period would strongly influence later civil movements in the United States:"

It covers his pre-war experience in London, the capital city of England and the United Kingdom. Chiang Yee's account was one of the first widely available books written by a Chinese author in English. He was fascinated by such social conventions as afternoon tea and discussing the weather. Comparing London with China Chiang Yee draws parallels and contrasts: \"I am bound to look at things from a different angle, but I have never agreed with people who hold that the various nationalities differ greatly from each other. They may be different superficially, but they eat, drink, sleep, dress, and shelter themselves from the wind and rain in the same way.\" The book is illustrated by the author with colour and monochrome plates in a Chinese style. The book was originally published by Country Life in London. Second and third impressions were published in 1938 and a fourth impression was published in 1940. It was reprinted by Signal Books in 2001 (). This book  is part of The Silent Traveller series. In 1940, he moved from London to Oxford due to the loss of his flat during the Blitz in World War II, and subsequently wrote The Silent Traveller in Oxford in 1944."

Kunstler explores themes of local and sustainable living. In interviews, Kunstler describes his imaginary world as an \"enlightened nineteenth century.\" The overarching premise, however, is a stark look into the future at the dire consequences of the poor American system of urban planning, and the complete lack of workability the contemporary suburban arrangement possesses without the continuous input of inexpensive and abundant energy to maintain its infrastructure. This has been the core theme of Kunstler's non-fiction works, including The Geography of Nowhere (1993) and The Long Emergency (2005)."

The title \"Rosso Malpelo\" is Italian for \"evil redhead\", a nickname which combines Rosso (red) with Malpelo (evil hair), as Sicilians believed people with red hair were malicious and had an evil disposition. The story, written in 1878, is set in Verga's native Sicily and reflects the social and economic conditions endured by the poor working classes in Southern Italy at the time. The story is a fine example of Italian Realism or Verismo, and is written in Verga's concise, impersonal and distinctly Sicilian style, manipulating the narrative voice into something more akin to the oral tradition. His subject matter and scientific style has led to comparison to \u00c9mile Zola's more widely known book, Germinal. This short story appeared for the first time on Il fanfulla, an Italian journal, in 1878, and was later published in 1880 in a collection of other works by Verga, from his 1879\u20131880s \"Vita dei Campi\". The novella is widely known and appreciated in Italy, providing an interesting quasi-historical documentation of  the condition of the South following the unification of Italy. The book was adapted into a film in 2007, with a title of Little Boy Red."

The main focus is looking at The Mets following up their championship season while taking in the local Basketball and American Football teams too in a wildly frenetic overview of the coaches, stars, owners, trades and controversies that the season provided. Lupica and Goldman had been friends for thirty years when Lupica suggested to Goldman they collaborate on a book together, from his point of view and Goldman's point of view. Goldman: I wanted to be a sports columnist when I was a kid and then I learned more about what they did for a living and I decided I didn't want to do it. You have to go see all that shit. It's fun to go to a ball game occasionally. What was great, the year I did the book with Lupica, was I had press passes so I could go sit with all those people whose columns I read and watch a baseball game or a football game or a basketball game. Goldman said they would do alternate chapters. \"I would eventually show him what I had and he would show me what he had but for the most part, we kept away from each other.

Ace Books issued an edition in 1983. This edition modified the table of contents by shuffling the order of the material, and replacing nine stories from the 1968 edition with three additional ones. Ellison removed those nine stories from the reissue because they were available in other collections and he had grown sensitive to such overlap. The book was reissued again in 1997 by White Wolf Publishing as part of their Edgeworks series of Ellison reprints. Once again modifying the table of contents, it contains a further changed order and additional swapping of stories: one of the 1983 additions was retained, an additional two from the 1968 edition were removed, and two new stories were added."

The eponymous heroine of the poem was an impoverished Attic widow with whom Theseus stayed on his way to subdue the Marathonian Bull. On his return from accomplishing this feat, Theseus found that his hostess had died, and, in return for her humble hospitality, the hero founded a deme named for her and established there a sanctuary of Zeus Hecaleus in her honor. Although poorly preserved by papyrus fragments and quotations in ancient authors, the broad outline of the Hecale is relatively certain, and the text stands as an important witness to the poorly understood genre of the Hellenistic epyllion. It was also extremely influential and was alluded to by later Hellenistic poets and, later, Roman writers such as Lucretius, Horace, Ovid and Apuleius. The Rainer Fragments of the Hecale are one of most important sources of our knowledge of the Hecale.  They are preserved on a piece of a wooden tablet now in the papyri collection of Archduke Rainer in the Royal Library at Vienna, and were first published by Theodor Gomperz in volume VI of the Mitteilungen aus der Sammlung Papyrus Erzherzog Rainer. The character of the writing, according to Wessely, assigns the tablet to the 4th century AD."

Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn has stated that the book, among others by Banville, ought to have won the Booker Prize It was first published in 1982 by Secker & Warburg, and in the United States in 1987 by David R.

Kevin Billington directed in 1984 a film adaptation for the British broadcaster Channel 4, Reflections with Gabriel Byrne, Harriet Walter and Fionnula Flanagan. The book opens with: \"Words fail me.\" It follows the adventures of an aspiring biographer of Isaac Newton who rents a rural retreat in the south of Ireland to write an in-depth treatment of an obscure and disturbing letter Newton sent in 1693 to John Locke. He becomes involved with two women: Ottilie Garinger and her aunt, Charlotte. The presence of Charlotte's husband, Edward Lawless, creates a romantic triangle-plus-one. It has been observed that Charlotte, Ottilie and Edward are the three main characters of Goethe's 1809 novel Elective Affinities. The Newton Letter is the third of Banville's \"scientific tetralogy\" (preceded by Doctor Copernicus and Kepler, followed by Mefisto, a reworking of the Faust theme). The writer has suggested that those who wish to sample his work begin with this work (\"It's pretty well all there. And it's short.\")"

The book was first published in 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company; it was republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, and that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality. He criticizes Sigmund Freud and argues that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions. He maintains that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning, that early puberty and early masturbation are important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and that a majority of adults are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality and argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general. The book was controversial and received many negative reviews. It was criticized for Tripp's rambling style, sexism, views about the biological basis of male and female sexual behavior, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, who criticized Tripp's dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, accused him of being biased in favor of homosexuality, charged that he mistakenly claimed that gay men tend to have a larger than average penis size, and objected to his discussion of attempts to change homosexuality through psychotherapy. Tripp himself believed that The Homosexual Matrix had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, the book was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Some commentators complimented Tripp's criticism of psychotherapy and supported his view that erotic feeling depends on resistances to its satisfaction."

Later English editions, such as an 1869 Hamburg edition, were entitled The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. The essay discusses the French coup of 1851 in which Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte assumed dictatorial powers. It shows Marx in his form as a social and political historian, treating actual historical events from the viewpoint of his materialist conception of history. The title refers to the Coup of 18 Brumaire in which Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in revolutionary France (9 November 1799, or 18 Brumaire Year VIII in the French Republican Calendar), in order to contrast it with the coup of 1851."

        "content": "The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation is a translation studies book by Lawrence Venuti originally released in 1995. A second, substantially revised edition was published in 2008. This book represents one of Venuti's most-studied works in which the author attempts to retrace the history of translation across the ages. In it, he lays out his theory that so-called \"domesticating practices\" at work in society have contributed to the invisibility of the translator in translations. He claims that legal and cultural constraints make it so that \"'faithful rendition' is defined partly by the illusion of transparency\", such that foreignizing or experimental types of translation are \"likely to encounter opposition from publishers and large segments of Anglophone readers who read for immediate intelligibility\". This leads to a climate in which \"fluency\" is the most important quality for a translation and all traces of foreignness or alterity tend to be purposely erased. For Venuti, fluency in itself is not to be rejected; he believes that translations should be readable. The problem is rather that dominant notions of readability in translation emphasize an extremely narrow form of the translating language, usually the current standard dialect, regardless of the language, register, style or discourse of the source text. When fluency is achieved through the standard or most widely used form of the translating language, the illusion that the translation is not a translation but the source text is produced, and the inevitable assimilation of that text to values in the receiving culture is concealed. Venuti sees two main methods of questioning or forestalling these domesticating effects: one is to choose source texts that run counter to existing patterns of translating from particular languages and cultures, challenging canons in the receiving culture; the other is to vary the standard dialect, to experiment with nonstandard linguistic items (regional and social dialects, colloquialism and slang, obscenity, archaism, neologism), although not arbitrarily, taking into account the features of the source text. These methods do not give back the source text unmediated; they are foreignizing, constructing a sense of the foreign that is always already mediated by receiving cultural values. In spite of their invisibility, the author asserts the historic power of translators: he maintains that translations have forced massive shifts in the Western literary canon and led to evolutions in literature and academic theory over time, as well as influencing the vision that societies have of foreign cultures. He therefore argues for a paradigm shift in the way translators consider their role, calling for them to curb the traditional domestication of translations and allow foreign influences to infiltrate translated texts. This position has led to him being compared to Antoine Berman. The Translator's Invisibility has been a source of much debate \u2013 and sometimes criticism \u2013 among translation experts. Nevertheless, it has largely entered into the translation studies canon and is often required reading for translation students."

Not much is known about the work, although it seems to have been inspired by the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu (\"On Grief\"), and its structure was probably similar to a series of letter correspondences between Servius Sulpicius Rufus and Cicero. Fragments of the work survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note of the work in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was a fake, with modern stylometric methods backing this up."

        "title": "A Rape on Campus_Summary",
        "content": "\"A Rape on Campus\" is a retracted, defamatory Rolling Stone magazine article written by Sabrina Erdely and originally published on November 19, 2014, that describes a purported group sexual assault at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, Virginia. Rolling Stone retracted the story in its entirety on April 5, 2015. The article claimed that a UVA student\u2014\"Jackie\"\u2014had been taken to a party hosted by UVA's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity by a fellow student. At the party, Jackie alleged in the article, her date led her to a bedroom where she was gang raped by several fraternity members as part of a fraternity initiation ritual. Jackie's account generated much media attention, and UVA President Teresa Sullivan suspended all fraternities. After other journalists investigated the article's claims and found significant discrepancies, Rolling Stone issued multiple apologies for the story. It has since been reported that Jackie may have invented portions of the story in an unsuccessful attempt to win the affections of a fellow student in whom she had a romantic interest. In a deposition given in 2016, Jackie stated that she believed her story at the time. On January 12, 2015, Charlottesville Police officials told UVA that an investigation had failed to find any evidence confirming the events in the Rolling Stone article. UVA President Teresa Sullivan acknowledged that the story was discredited. Charlottesville Police officially suspended their four-month investigation on March 23, 2015, based on lack of credible evidence. The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism audited the editorial processes that culminated in the article being published. On April 5, 2015, Rolling Stone retracted the article and published the independent report on the publication's history. UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and several fraternity members later filed lawsuits against Erdely and Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone lost at trial the suit filed by Eramo, and settled the lawsuits with the fraternity and its members. Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner said he suffered as much as Eramo. In light of the findings, Erik Wemple of The Washington Post pronounced the story \"a complete crock\". In the Columbia Journalism Review, Bill Grueskin called the story \"a mess\u2014thinly sourced, full of erroneous assumptions, and plagued by gaping holes in the reporting\". The Columbia Journalism Review called the story \"this year's media-fail sweepstakes\" and the Poynter Institute named it as the \"Error of the Year\" in journalism."

        "content": "Supremi apostolatus officio (The Supreme Apostolic Office), commonly referred to as \"On Devotion of the Rosary\", is the first of a number of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII on the Rosary. It was issued on September 1, 1883, encouraging the practice. Leo XIII echoed the words of the oldest known Marian prayer (known in the Latin tradition as the \"Sub Tuum Praesidium\"), when he wrote, \"It has always been the habit of Catholics in danger and in troublous times to fly for refuge to Mary.\" He then gives a brief history of the rosary. The saint who instituted the Rosary was St. Dominic who was fighting the heresy of the Albigensians: \"Our merciful God, as you know, raised up against these most direful enemies a most holy man, the illustrious parent and founder of the Dominican Order... he proceeded undauntedly to attack the enemies of the Catholic Church, not by force of arms; but trusting wholly to that devotion which he was the first to institute under the name of the Holy Rosary\" The Albigensians were a \"neo-Manichaean sect that flourished in southern France in the 12th and 13th centuries [...] The Albigenses asserted the coexistence of two mutually opposed principles one good, and one evil. The former is the creator of the spiritual, the latter of the material world.\" Leo also claimed that the praying of the Rosary had resulted in Catholic victories over enemies in battles: \"[I]n the sixteenth century, when the vast forces of the Turks threatened to impose on nearly the whole of Europe the yoke of superstition and barbarism [...] the Christian fleet gained a magnificent victory, with no great loss to itself, in which the enemy were routed with great slaughter. [...] Similarly, important successes were in the last century gained over the Turks at Temeswar, in Pannonia, and at Corfu; and in both cases these engagements coincided with feasts of the Blessed Virgin and with the conclusion of public devotions of the Rosary. And this led our predecessor, Clement XI, in his gratitude, to decree that the Blessed Mother of God should every year be especially honoured in her Rosary by the whole Church.\" Leo saw the Rosary as \"an effective spiritual weapon against the evils afflicting society\". \"Not only do We earnestly exhort all Christians to give themselves to the recital of the pious devotion of the Rosary publicly, or privately in their own house and family, and that unceasingly, but we also desire that the whole of the month of October in this year should be consecrated to the Holy Queen of the Rosary.\" In furtherance of this, he recommended that from October 1 to November 2, in every parish, and where practicable in every chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin: \"let five decades of the Rosary be recited with the addition of the Litany of Loreto. We desire that the people should frequent these pious exercises; and We will that either Mass shall be said at the altar, or that the Blessed Sacrament shall be exposed to the adoration of the faithful, Benediction being afterwards given.\""
