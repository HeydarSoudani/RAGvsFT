The album is often considered the second in a trio of folk rock albums released by the band at the end of the 1970s, alongside Songs from the Wood (1977) and Stormwatch (1979). In contrast to the British folklore-inspired lyrical content found on Songs From the Wood, Heavy Horses adopts a more realist and earthly perspective of country living \u2014 the album and its title track are dedicated to the \"indigenous working ponies and horses of Great Britain\". Musically, the album sees the band continuing the combination of folk and progressive rock found on Songs From the Wood, although with an overall darker and more sober sound fitting the changed lyrical content."

The Who were looking for a way to follow up their 1969 album Tommy, and had recorded several shows on tours supporting that album, but didn't like the sound. Consequently, they booked the show at Leeds University, along with one at Hull City Hall the following day, specifically to record a live album. Six songs were taken from the Leeds show, and the cover was pressed to look like a bootleg recording. The sound was significantly different from Tommy and featured hard rock arrangements that were typical of the band's live shows. The album was released in 23 May 1970 by Decca and MCA in the United States by Track and Polydor in the United Kingdom. It has been reissued on several occasions and in several different formats. Since its release, Live at Leeds has been cited by several music critics as the best live rock recording of all time."

Quasimodo was born with a hunchback and feared by the townspeople as a sort of monster, but he finds sanctuary in an unlikely love that is fulfilled only in death. The role of Quasimodo has been played by many actors in film and stage adaptations, including Lon Chaney Sr. (1923), Charles Laughton (1939) and Anthony Quinn (1956), as well as Tom Hulce in the 1996 Disney animated adaptation, and most recently Angelo Del Vecchio in the Notre Dame de Paris revival. In 2010, a British researcher found evidence suggesting there was a real-life hunchbacked stone carver who worked at Notre Dame during the same period Victor Hugo was writing the novel and they may have even known each other."

The singer asserted partial creative control over the project\u2014as a co-producer and composer of the material\u2014assisted by Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers, David Ball and Rob Dougan. Influenced by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s, sonically Impossible Princess is a departure from Minogue's previous work. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, and rock. Lyrically, the album's focus is on Minogue's self-discovery after a series of trips around the world, and delves into freedom of expression, relationships and emotions. Upon its release, critical and public reception of Impossible Princess was divided over its new musical direction and Minogue's very intimate lyrics. In retrospect, described as an underrated release, the record has achieved widespread critical acclaim and Minogue's creative input and its mixture of genres have been widely praised. Commercially, the album reached the top 10 in Australia, Scotland and the United Kingdom, and was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 70,000 units; however, the British media mocked its lack of success in Europe. Four singles were released from the album: \"Some Kind of Bliss\", \"Did It Again\", \"Breathe\", and \"Cowboy Style\", each of which experienced moderate success. After a small promotional tour in 1997, Minogue embarked on the Intimate and Live tour in Australia and the UK the following year, which was a commercial and critical success. Since the album's release, various commentators have cited Impossible Princess as Minogue's best work, It has earned numerous nominations and recognition on best-ever lists. Despite this, Minogue has said she will never create another studio album of personal songs like Impossible Princess."

        "content": "is an animated music video created by Studio Ghibli for the song \"On Your Mark\" by the Japanese rock duo Chage & Aska. The song was released in 1994 as part of the single \"Heart\". In 1995, Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the short film for the song as a side-project after having writer's block with Princess Mononoke. The anime music video is non-linear, providing multiple reiterations and alternate scenes to depict the events. The music video added sound effects to the audio track, but contains no dialogue. Miyazaki purposely misinterpreted the lyrics to present his vision of a world where the surface becomes inhospitable and humans live in an underground city. He made the video cryptic to evoke creative interpretations among viewers. The music video follows two policemen who raid and massacre a religious cult and find an angelic being, only to have her taken away and confined to a secure laboratory. Haunted by the fate of the \"angel\", the two men formulate a plan and break into the laboratory. Fleeing in an armored truck, the three plummet into an abyss after trying to force past a police aircraft along a narrow, suspended roadway. After a montage of the previous scenes, the armored truck suddenly rockets into an apartment complex, allowing their escape. The three escape to the surface, ignoring the radiation and danger signs, emerging near an encased nuclear reactor. The two men set the \"angel\" free and she flies off into the sky. The music video was well-received and praised for its animation and attention to detail. It premiered as a short before Studio Ghibli's Whisper of the Heart and has since been released on Laserdisc and DVD as part of the All Things Ghibli Special Short Short compilation."

The album was lyrically inspired by the memberships of Bono, the Edge, and Larry Mullen Jr. in a Christian group called the \"Shalom Fellowship\", and consequently it contains spiritual and religious themes. Their involvement with Shalom Fellowship led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the \"rock and roll\" lifestyle, and threatened to break up the band. After completing the third leg of the Boy Tour in February 1981, U2 began to write new material for October, entering the recording studio in July 1981. Just as they did for their 1980 debut Boy the band recorded at Windmill Lane Studios with Lillywhite producing. The recording sessions were complicated by Bono's loss of a briefcase containing in-progress lyrics for the new songs, forcing a hurried, improvisational approach to completing the album on time. October was preceded by the lead single \"Fire\" in July 1981, while its second single \"Gloria\" coincided with its release. The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. In 2008, a remastered edition of October was released."

The \"Sousaside\" features sound effects recorded by Philip Perkins to create the effect of a marching band on a happy occasion; a mix of \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" without sound effects was released as a B-side to the \"Kaw-Liga\" single. Stars & Hank Forever is also the last studio album to feature guitarist Snakefinger, before his early death in July 1987.

During most of the series, Donna works for White House Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman as a senior assistant (or, as she jokingly calls herself in one episode, the \"deputy deputy chief of staff\"), until she quits her job to work for the presidential campaign of Bob Russell in season 6. Although all the senior staffs' assistants are continuing characters with personal backgrounds, Donna is the best defined and most often featured staff member on the assistant level, and her difficult, semi-romantic relationship with Josh is a recurring plotline throughout the show. She later works for Bob Russell's campaign for President as a spokeswoman, taking the same job for Matt Santos's campaign after Russell loses the primary."

        "content": "\"Closer\" is a song by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as the second single on their second studio album, The Downward Spiral (1994). Released on May 30, 1994, it is considered one of Nine Inch Nails' signature songs and remains their most popular song. Most versions of the single are titled \"Closer to God\", a rare example in music of a single's title differing from the title of its A-side (\"Closer to God\" is also the title of an alternate version of \"Closer\" featured on the single, which was also released as a separate promotional single for club-play). The single is the ninth official Nine Inch Nails release, making it \"Halo 9\" in the band's official Halo numbering system. A promotional single provided by the label to radio stations included both long and short vocal-censored (i.e. silenced profanity) versions. Although the song addresses themes such as self-hatred and obsession, its sexually aggressive chorus led to widespread misinterpretation of the song as an anthem of lust, which helped it become Nine Inch Nails' most successful single up to that time and cemented Trent Reznor's status as an industrial rock icon. Commercially, \"Closer\" reached  41 on the US Billboard Hot 100, No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 3 on the Australian Singles Chart. Censored versions of the song and its Mark Romanek-directed music video received substantial airplay on radio and MTV."

Recorded on October 23, 1963, the song was released on Dylan's 1964 album The Times They Are a-Changin' and gives a generally factual account of the killing of a 51-year-old African-American barmaid, Hattie Carroll (March 3, 1911 \u2013 February 9, 1963), by then 24-year-old William Devereux \"Billy\" Zantzinger (February 7, 1939 \u2013 January 3, 2009), a young man from a wealthy  white tobacco farming family in Charles County, Maryland, and of his subsequent sentence to six months in a county jail, after being convicted of assault. The melody is largely taken from a folk song called \u201dMary Hamilton\u201d. The lyrics are a commentary on 1960s racism. When Carroll was killed in 1963, Charles County was still strictly segregated by race in public facilities such as restaurants, churches, theaters, doctor's offices, buses and the county fair. The schools of Charles County were not integrated until 1967."

Initial sessions were recorded at American Sound Studio in Memphis, while Springfield's final vocals and the album's orchestral parts were recorded at Atlantic Records' New York City studios. The album was released on 18 January 1969 in the United States by Atlantic Records, and Philips Records distributed the record outside the U.S. Springfield worked on the album with a team of musicians and producers that included Jerry Wexler, Arif Mardin, Tom Dowd, conductor Gene Orloff, backing vocalists the Sweet Inspirations, bassist Tommy Cogbill, and guitarist Reggie Young. Dusty in Memphis sold poorly upon its initial release, despite featuring one of Springfield's top-10 UK hits, \"Son of a Preacher Man\". It has since been generally acclaimed as her best work and one of the greatest albums of all time. Music critic Robert Christgau called it \"the all-time rock-era torch record\" and included it in his \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). In 2001, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2020, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In its official press release, the library stated that despite its modest sales when first released, \"over time, Dusty in Memphis grew in stature to become widely recognized as an important album by a woman in the rock era.\""

The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's cinematic, downtempo sound, the erotic themes in his and Gaye's songwriting, and the singer's prominent use of the synthesizer. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971). I Want You consisted of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked a change in musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics at the time of its release, I Want You has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R&B, and neo soul."

        "content": "\"I Get Lonely\" is a song by American singer Janet Jackson from her sixth studio album, The Velvet Rope (1997). It was written by Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Jackson's then-husband, Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr. It was released on February 24, 1998, by Virgin Records as the album's third single. The track is a departure from Jackson's signature brand of crossover dance-pop and R&B into a pure R&B and soul vibe. Lyrically, it expresses loneliness and the desire for an estranged lover. A remixed version of the song featured American R&B group Blackstreet. \"I Get Lonely\" became Jackson's eighteenth consecutive top-ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, setting a record as the only female artist in history to achieve that feat. The song received a BMI Pop Award for \"Most Played Song\" and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and was later included on Janet's second greatest hits album Number Ones (2009). Its music video, directed by Paul Hunter, received positive reception for its abounding sex appeal."

Johnson's performancevocal accompanied by his finger-style acoustic guitar playinghas been described as \"devastatingly bleak\".  He recorded the song in 1937 during his last recording session and in 1939 it was issued as the last of his original 78\u00a0rpm records. \"Love in Vain\" has elements of earlier Delta blues songs and for a while it was believed to be in the public domain.  In 1969, the Rolling Stones recorded an updated rendition featuring an electric slide guitar solo. The popularity of their adaptation led to a lawsuit over the copyright, which was eventually resolved in favor of Johnson's estate.  Various artists have recorded the song."

        "content": "\"Butterfly\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter, and record producer Mariah Carey for her sixth studio album of the same name (1997). It was released on December 1, 1997, by Columbia Records as the second single from the album. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. \"Butterfly\" is a  pop and R&B ballad combining elements of gospel. Carey had originally conceived it as a house record with David Morales titled \"Fly Away\" (Butterfly Reprise). After realizing how personal the lyrics were and how they could be applied to Butterfly, she wrote the album's title track with Afanasieff. On the song's lyrics, Carey sings to someone, telling them to spread their wings and release into the world on their own, like a butterfly. The accompanying music video for \"Butterfly\" depicts Carey in an abandoned house, trapped in a desolate life. As the video progresses, she leaves, apparently for the first time in years, and runs into a nearby meadow. Towards the end, Carey jumps over a barbed fence and goes out into the world on a horse. The song's lyrics and video were directly connected to Carey's personal life at the time. \"Butterfly\" was performed live on the Late Show with David Letterman, Saturday Night Live, and various European television programs. The song was also a permanent part of the set-list during her Butterfly World Tour during 1998. Due to current conflict with Columbia, \"Butterfly\" was never issued a commercial release, therefore hindering its charting ability. The single performed weakly on the charts, peaking outside the top 20 in most countries, except for New Zealand, where it peaked at number 15. The song also reached the top-ten in Croatia and Taiwan. In 2003, Q Magazine ranked \"Butterfly\" at number 563 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\"."

It is considered the first released album to feature mostly samples and loops, influencing the heavy use of sampling and looping in popular music. Yellow Magic Orchestra's approach to sampling music was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology. In 2008, Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore provided a cover of \"Gradated Grey\" for the Haruomi Hosono tribute album Strange Songbook (Tribute To Haruomi Hosono 2). In 2016, the Canadian post-punk group Preoccupations covered the track \"Key\" as a part of a 7\" vinyl that came with pre-orders of their self-titled album alongside a cover of The Raincoats' 1979 track \"Off-Duty Trip\"."

An extension of the theme from the group's #1 hit \"My Girl\", which had been released the previous December, \"My Baby\" features The Temptations, with David Ruffin on lead, bragging about the qualities of a special lady. Ruffin praises his woman's hairstyles (\"hair soft like a baby lamb/and I love to run my fingers through it\") and personality (\"the gold in her personality/could set Fort Knox to shame\"), and hopes that \"she digs me the way I am/but if I have to change/you know I'm gona do it for my baby\". Cash Box described the single as an \"easy-going, pop-r&b romantic shuffler about a love-sick fella who\u2019ll do anything for his girlfriend.\"  \"My Baby\" was a notable attempt to create an uptempo danceable number for the Temptations; all of their previous Top 20 hits to this point had been either ballads or mid-tempo numbers. The single immediately following \"My Baby\", \"Get Ready\", followed the same plan, and was produced with an even faster tempo and a brassier arrangement. Unusually for Temptations singles, \"My Baby's\" B-side, the Paul Williams-led \"Don\u2019t Look Back\", was a minor hit in its own right, becoming a top 20 R&B hit and serving for several years as the Temptations' live-show closing number. Both sides of the single would be remixed for its 2nd pressing, adding on the following statements: \"Taken from the album #G 914 The Temptin' Temptations.\""

Produced entirely by Norman Whitfield, Puzzle People takes the next step along the path that Cloud Nine started, and takes the Temptations further away from a classic soul sound, and more towards the realm of psychedelic soul. Although a few ballads, including \"Running Away (Ain't Gonna Help You)\", are still present, the album is primarily composed of Sly & the Family Stone/James Brown-derived proto-funk tracks such as the lead single \"Don't Let the Joneses Get You Down\", and the number-one Billboard Pop hit \"I Can't Get Next to You\". Also included are psychedelic-styled covers (recorded with distorted guitars, clavinets, and spacy reverb and sound effects) of contemporary songs such as The Isley Brothers' \"It's Your Thing\", The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\", and Roger Miller's \"Little Green Apples\". As opposed to the recordings of the David Ruffin/\"Classic 5\" era, the lead vocals here are frequently traded back and forth between the group members, with each of the two singles featuring all five Temptations on lead, and Dennis Edwards, Eddie Kendricks, and Paul Williams dominating most of the leads on the album tracks. The lyrics on some of the original numbers, written by former Motown artist Barrett Strong, were becoming increasingly socially conscious and political. \"Slave\" deals with the injustice in the prison system, while \"Message From a Black Man\" is a Black power song with a militant refrain: \"no matter how hard you try/you can't stop me now.\" \"Message From a Black Man\" was a popular radio request in 1969, although the Temptations themselves, who thought the record too forward, never performed it live. Puzzle People was released on the same day (September 23, 1969) as Together, a duets album of covers by the Temptations and labelmates Diana Ross & the Supremes.  It peaked into the Top 5 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and spent fifteen weeks at number one on the R&B Albums chart."

        "content": "\"Helpless\" is a song written by Canadian singer-songwriter Neil Young, recorded by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) on their 1970 album D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. \"Helpless\" was originally recorded with Young's band Crazy Horse in early 1969, before Young's new CSNY bandmates (he had joined the then-trio in mid-1969) convinced him it would suit them better. The song was simple, at its core effectively the repetition of one melody over a descending D-A-G chord progression. The group found difficulty deciding on an arrangement, and many different versions of the song were recorded before the group finally decided on the slow-paced version that appeared on the album. On this final version Young was in the foreground, singing the verses and the chorus with his bandmates providing the \"helpless\" refrain, while the instrumentation came in the form of acoustic guitar, electric guitar (with volume pedal and tremolo), piano, bass and drums. It became one of the most revered songs from the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu album (Q magazine's Peter Doggett regards it as \"one of (the album's) showpieces\"), and has remained a live favorite of Young's for over forty years.  An alternate mix of the CSNY version was released on Neil Young's The Archives Vol. 1 1963\u20131972. It features Young playing harmonica and electronically treated percussion. Young played the song with The Band in the group's final concert with its original lineup, on American Thanksgiving Day 1976 at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom, with Joni Mitchell providing backing vocals offstage. The performance was featured in the Martin Scorcese concert film The Last Waltz. The \"town in North Ontario\" referred to in the opening line of the song is often presumed to be Ontario native Young's hometown; Young himself cleared up the rumors in a 1995 Mojo interview with Nick Kent: \"Well, it's not literally a specific town so much as a feeling. Actually, it's a couple of towns. Omemee, Ontario, is one of them. It's where I first went to school and spent my 'formative' years. Actually I was born in Toronto...\" Omemee lies just west of Peterborough and 128\u00a0km (approx. 80 miles) northeast of Toronto."

He has approached them with affection, but as music to be played in his style. The result is a fascinating combination:  the techniques of modern jazz, blues, and gospel, all applied to the spiritual.\" - Joe Goldberg This album was remastered and reissued in Blue Note's Rudy Van Gelder Edition series on March 1, 2005."

It is a song steeped with antiwar lyrics and Jackson's wish for humanity of making the world a better place. In a 2001 Internet chat with fans, Jackson said that \"Heal the World\" is the song he was most proud to have created. He also created the Heal the World Foundation, a charitable organization which was designed to improve the lives of children. The organization was also meant to teach children how to help others. This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the Dangerous World Tour. In the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson said he created the song in his \"Giving Tree\" at Neverland Ranch. An ensemble performance of \"We Are the World\" and \"Heal the World\" closed Jackson's memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. The song was performed as rehearsed by Jackson at the venue just weeks earlier, in preparation for his planned \"This Is It\" concerts in London along with \"Dirty Diana\". R&B singer Ciara sang the song as a tribute to Jackson at the 2009 BET Awards. The song was played at the funeral of James Bulger, and Jackson also donated the song to be used as the anthem for the James Bulger Red Balloon Centre, a school for children to go to if they are being bullied or have learning difficulties."

        "content": "The discography of New Order, an English rock band, consists of 10 studio albums, 12 compilation albums, six live albums, five extended plays (EPs), 45 singles, 12 video releases, 40 music videos and a number of soundtrack appearances. New Order were formed in 1980 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The group began life as a continuation of their former incarnation Joy Division. Joy Division had disbanded after the death of the lead singer Ian Curtis. Gillian Gilbert, who was Morris' girlfriend at the time, soon joined the group and played guitar and keyboards. Remarkably, New Order's first eight singles released between 1981 and 1984 were not taken from any album. In most cases they were not even released as a 7-inch, but exclusively available in the radio-unfriendly 12-inch format, an unusual approach for a pop-act in the eighties. Despite the high anticipation that surrounded the group, their debut single \"Ceremony\" only peaked at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The group's following two singles and their debut album met with similar moderate success. It would not be until the release of their fourth single, \"Blue Monday\", that New Order would break into the top 10, with the song peaking at number 9. \"Blue Monday\" became a defining single for the group and caused a sensation, becoming the biggest selling 12-inch single of all time. New Order, like many other post-punk groups of the period, increasingly utilised keyboards, drum machine and sequencers in their music. As a result, they became associated with the synthpop and electronic dance movements of the 1980s. Beginning with Power, Corruption & Lies from 1983, all of the group's studio albums reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The group experienced a lull in popularity in the years 1985 and 1986 but the surprise international popularity of the \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" single re-launched the group across the world. The group cemented their success in 1987 with the single, \"True Faith\", and the compilation album Substance. New Order were at the peak of their popularity in the years 1987 to 1993, with a run of popular singles, including \"Blue Monday 1988\", \"Fine Time\", \"Regret\", \"World (The Price of Love)\" and in 1990 they scored their only number 1 single in the UK with the official England national football team song, \"World in Motion\". The two albums released during these years, Technique and Republic; each charted at number 1 in the UK. It was during this successful period that the group's internal dynamic began to falter. Sumner was not fond of touring, and wanted to take time off from the group and produce a solo album. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr and the pair released their first single in 1989. Hook formed his own band, Revenge, in 1989, while Morris and Gilbert worked together as The Other Two, primarily scoring soundtracks. Of the three side projects, Sumner's was by far the most successful. The recording and touring of 1993's Republic, their first for London Records, was difficult and intra-band tensions were rife. The group went on hiatus until 1998. In the meantime two compilation albums, The Best of New Order and The Rest of New Order, and several singles were released. The group reconvened in 1998 for the Reading Festival but did not release new material until 2000. The group released the album Get Ready in 2001. It was met with critical warmth, but it was apparent that the group's popularity had lessened. The lead single from the album, \"Crystal\", reached the top 10 in the UK. The film 24 Hour Party People, a humorous chronicle of their label Factory Records, was released in 2002. New Order contributed a new song, \"Here to Stay\", and a re-recording of the Joy Division song \"New Dawn Fades\" with Moby, for the film's soundtrack. The compilation International and four-disc boxset Retro were released in winter 2002. New Order followed Get Ready with Waiting for the Sirens' Call in 2005. During this period Gilbert stepped down from live performances due to family commitments. Phil Cunningham stepped into her role and in 2005 became an official member of the group. The group had intended to release a ninth album soon after Waiting for the Sirens' Call, the majority of which had already been recorded. The lack of enthusiasm inside the group and relative failure of Waiting for the Sirens' Call stalled their career momentum. In 2007, Hook decided to leave the group, and stated that he and Sumner had no further plans to work together. Sumner formed Bad Lieutenant with Cunningham, and Hook formed Freebass. Morris continued to work with Sumner and Cunningham. In 2008, New Order released remastered and expanded editions of their first five albums with the intention of releasing the further three albums in a similar format in the future. Lost Sirens was released in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2013. It is an eight-track album of tracks left out of Waiting for the Sirens' Call. On 25 September 2015, the band released a new album, Music Complete. The album was the first without Peter Hook, and was produced mostly by the band themselves, except \"Singularity\" and \"Unlearn This Hatred\", both produced by Tom Rowlands, while \"Superheated\" features additional production by Stuart Price. In 2020, New Order released \"Be a Rebel\", their first non-album single since \"Here to Stay\" in 2002. In the US, the band has sold a certified 2 million albums, and in the UK a certified 1.24 million albums."

The final track is a live version of a Jimmy Reed song that was recorded on an audience microphone at a small \"secret\" gig in California, giving it a bootleg feel. A bonus track, \"Interstate,\" was included on the vinyl record release of the album and the CD single of \"Big Time\", and is an outtake from the 1990 Ragged Glory sessions. Although he would make Looking Forward with Crosby, Stills & Nash released in 1999, this record would be the last studio album by Neil Young for four years and the last in a string of rock albums broken only by Harvest Moon."

        "content": "Wiggle is the fifth studio album by the Chicago-based punk rock band Screeching Weasel. Initially planned for release in November 1992, the album was finally released on CD, vinyl and cassette on January 15, 1993 through Lookout Records. Due to a \"cymbal hissing\" in the original vinyl version, the album was remixed and re-released soon afterwards. After the band's popularity had grown with their previous album My Brain Hurts, the group felt pressured with the follow-up album. While most of Wiggle is in a similar vein to their previous album, some songs saw the band experimenting with new wave and a few featured a more hardcore-influenced sound reminiscent of the group's earlier material. In retrospect, vocalist Ben Weasel has voiced dissatisfaction with the album, mainly the songs that were chosen for it. However, he considers the band's performance and the album's production better than My Brain Hurts. The album was remastered and reissued by Asian Man Records in 2005 shortly after the band had removed its catalog from Lookout due to unpaid royalties and a vinyl version was released by Recess Records in 2009."

Dawn vocalist Attrell \"Prince Be\" Cordes; only Prince Be and \"True\" writer Gary Kemp were credited for writing the tune. The song was P.M. Dawn's first (and only) number-one hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, and it was the first number-one song after the debut of the Nielsen SoundScan system, which monitored airplay and sales more closely than before, when Billboard had to rely on manual sales reports and airplay data. According to the test charts of the SoundScan system, \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\" was at number one for at least three weeks but officially has a one-week reign at number one. Worldwide, it reached number one in New Zealand, number three in the United Kingdom and number seven in Australia. It was ranked number 81 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. And Blender ranked it at number 94 in their list of Greatest Songs Since You Were Born in 2005.

It was released in April 1980 by record label Factory as a  flexi disc intended to be given away free in select record shops. 75,000 copies were pressed. The tracks are outtakes from the recording session for the album Closer. The single's B-sides, \"Incubation\" and \"As You Said\", are both instrumentals. This was the final release from Joy Division before Ian Curtis's death in May 1980. \"Komakino\" and \"Incubation\" appear on the 1988 compilation Substance, and \"As You Said\" was added in the expanded reissue of the album in 2015 and in the B-side of New Order's Video 586 single. All three tracks are also collected on the 4-CD 1997 compilation Heart and Soul. The Komakino Site, also known as the Komakino Remains or the Komakino Stone Circle, is an ancient set of structures in Japan's Aomori Prefecture consisting of three rings of stones and a fourth, partial outer ring. There are no obvious parallels between the Joy Division song and the site, in any descriptive or literal sense. The name was used in 1979 for a German tape label apparently predating and perhaps inspiring Joy Division's title. It has since been used for an Italian fanzine, a number of groups, most prominently a German techno group active since 1989, and an avant-garde menswear shop in Vancouver, Canada."

Like their song \"Tire Me\" from the 1996 album Evil Empire, \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d never had a music video or was released on any media formats. It did however receive enough radio airplay to become an album favorite. The artwork most commonly associated with the song is from a competition the band held for the then upcoming album The Battle of Los Angeles. Competing artists were given titles to put on their covers including \"Agunzagun\", \"Battle Hymns\", and \"The Battle of Los Angeles\". One of the titles was even a verse from \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d - \"The Riot Be the Rhyme of the Unheard\". Tom Morello eventually used the name \"Battle Hymns\" for a track on his debut album, One Man Revolution in 2007. \"Calm Like a Bomb\" is notable as a display of guitarist Tom Morello's creative use of a whammy pedal. Like many of RATM's songs, the song's lyrics discuss social inequalities. The song also features a reference to Emiliano Zapata. Tim Commerford uses a combination of a home-made overdrive pedal and the Jim Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah pedal on his bass throughout the song. In Rolling Stone magazine's feature article on the new \"Guitar Heroes,\" a section was printed about Tom Morello, and \u201cCalm Like a Bomb\u201d was cited as the prime example of his skill and fame on the guitar. He has occasionally referred to the extremely high whammy-pedal effects used in songs such as this as \"pterodactyl sounds.\" \"Calm Like a Bomb\" made its live debut on June 11, 1999, at the K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Wantagh, New York at Jones Beach Amphitheater. It was prominently featured in the ending credits of The Matrix Reloaded and was also included in the film's soundtrack."

Pete Doherty claimed in an interview with Newsnight that he had no input for the video of the song, which does not feature the band but two young boys on a council estate (Thamesmead), implied to be a young Pete and Carl.

        "content": "Widespread Panic is the self-titled, second studio album by the Athens, Georgia-based band Widespread Panic. It was first released by Capricorn Records and Warner Bros. Records on July 30, 1991. It was re-released in 2001 by Zomba Music Group. The album was issued on vinyl for the first time ever on July 29, 2014. The vinyl-only reissue will be distributed via ThinkIndie distribution and sold only at participating independent record stores. The band had originally recorded material in September 1990 at producer/collaborator/friend John Keane's studio in Athens, Georgia. This session, called Mom's Kitchen, featured the majority of the songs that would eventually be recorded for Widespread Panic, along with other tracks like \"A of D\", \"Impossible\", \"Machine\", \"Liza's Apartment (L.A.)\", \"Conrad\", \"Contentment Blues\", and \"Holden Oversoul\", of which the latter two were included on the reissues of Space Wrangler (1988). Mom's Kitchen, however, was never released because the band signed a six-album deal with Capricorn Records in January 1991. Recording of the album proper took place at Emerald Sound Studios (Nashville, Tennessee), Kiva Studios (Memphis, Tennessee), and Duck Tape Music Studio (Decatur, Alabama). The album features T Lavitz on keyboards and was produced by Johnny Sandlin. For many years after the album\u2019s release, rumors swirled that Track 7, C. Brown, was included on the album as a tribute to Camden, Alabama native Cliff Brown Jr., former singer for Tuscaloosa\u2019s The Ecchoing Green. These rumors were thought to have been put to rest when Brown, along with Green bass player Keith Ferguson, described their adventure during a 2004 interview with The Tuscaloosa News. However, the rumors have not completely died and are still currently debated. The band played the album in its entirety at the Charter One Pavilion in Chicago on September 2, 2009."

The album features just Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea playing acoustic piano.  The use of the acoustic instruments comes as a marked departure from both men's favoring of electric keyboards at that time. Herbie Hancock received top billing on this album, while Chick Corea was credited first on the album CoreaHancock, another recording from the same tour released by Polydor. On vinyl, \"February Moment\" (and its introduction) are indexed as one track. Moreover, the liner notes state that the sound on the fourth side of the album had to be compressed in order to fit the 13 and a half minute version of \"Maiden Voyage\" and the nearly 22 minute version of \"La Fiesta\" on a single side; this preserved the integrity of the performance, but lowered the sound quality.

It was released as a single in the US on 27 January 1975, backed with \"Snookeroo,\" and reached No. 1 in Canada, #3 in the Billboard charts and reached No. 1 on Cash Box charts in the US. In the song, the narrator meets a woman from Colombia who offers him marijuana; a woman from Mallorca, Spain who offers him cocaine; and a man from Nashville, Tennessee who offers him moonshine whiskey. The narrator declines all of them, saying that they are bad for his health. Harry Nilsson provides backing vocals. Some reissues and later pressings of the Ringo Starr version credit the song as \"No No Song/Skokiaan.\" This is presumably due to a copyright claim by the publishers of the latter song, although details are lacking. There are some similarities between parts of \"Skokiaan\" and the instrumental break between the second and third verses of Starr's version of the \"No No Song,\" but without documentation this is no more than a supposition."

For legal reasons, the singer can't discuss the details. Jason Gong said \"It's cool, because now that person has to hear it all the time. ... That is probably the most therapeutic song on the record.\""

In addition to these two tracks, they also updated \"Fever\" and \"Baby Girl Was Born\" from their 1997 album Mustang! with a more hip hop sound. Their collaboration with MIHO on this LP also set the groundwork for the production duo of Kj and BOTS collaborating with and producing future albums for other artists such as Sugar Soul, Wyolica, and Kaori Hifumi. This eventually led to the creation of the production team and hip hop group Steady & Co."

It was the most folk-based of the albums recorded by the band, with all the tracks being versions of traditional songs. Whereas their previous album had been produced by Shel Talmy, and featured quite a heavily produced, commercial sound, Cruel Sister was produced by Bill Leader, noted for his recordings of folk musicians. \"Lord Franklin\" is a version of the traditional ballad, also known as \"Lady Franklin's Lament\", which describes Sir John Franklin's ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage. John Renbourn sings the lead vocal and plays both acoustic and electric guitar. \"Cruel sister\", the song which provides the title for the album, is a traditional ballad (known in some versions as The Twa Sisters), telling the story of the violent rivalry between two sisters for the love of a knight. The whole of side two of the album is taken up with an extended version of the ballad \"Jack Orion\", previously recorded by Jansch on his own Jack Orion album. \"Jack Orion\" is a version of the Child ballad \"Glasgerion\". The arrangement on Cruel Sister develops through several sections with different rhythms and instrumentation. The album cover features engravings by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. The front cover displays his \"The Men's Bath\" (Das M\u00e4nnerbad) (date unknown). The picture on the back cover is his The Sea Monster (Das Meerwunder), dating from 1498."

It was the duo's fifth number two hit and made them the act with the second-most number two hits on the chart behind Madonna. The song also peaked at number 1 on the easy listening chart, becoming their eighth number 1 on that chart in four years. It is The Carpenters' biggest-selling record worldwide and their best-selling single in the UK, peaking at number 2. Richard Carpenter stated, on a Japanese documentary, that it was his favorite of all the songs that he had written. He has performed an instrumental version at concerts.

After the Flying Burrito Brothers scored a minor country hit in 1979 with a live cover of Merle Haggard's \"White Line Fever\", the band was dropped from their record contract and hit yet again with personnel changes. By 1980, Greg Harris and Ed Ponder had left the group, leaving the Burritos as a trio of \"Sneaky\" Pete Kleinow, Gib Guilbeau and Skip Battin. In addition to commitments with the Flying Burrito Brothers, Guilbeau was also working as a songwriter for Criterion Music with John Beland, who Guilbeau knew from his time in the band Swampwater. Guilbeau and Beland wrote some songs and ultimately, Beland was invited to join the Burritos. Beland was reluctant to join the now nearly defunct band, as he was riding strong as lead guitarist with Ricky Nelson who (with Beland's help) was enjoying his own comeback of sorts. However, after leaving Nelson in the hopes of producing the Burritos, Beland took the Burritos in a more commercial direction, having already written a number of country hits for other artists prior to his joining the FBB. In addition, the band's name at this time was shortened to simply The Burrito Brothers, a suggestion made by Curb Records. Beland's song demos, which featured the Burritos on them, eventually made it to Dick Whitehouse at Curb records, who signed the band to a deal with Curb / Epic Records. By December 1980, the band's first single for Curb, \"She's a Friend of a Friend\" reached the US country top 70. Hearts on the Line followed in January 1981 and spawned two further singles, both of which made the US country top 20, \"Does She Wish She Was Single Again?\" and \"She Belongs to Everyone But Me\". More would follow. That year, The Burrito Brothers received the number one \"Crossover from pop to country\" award from Billboard Magazine as well as best new vocal group award from Record World Magazine. But Skip Battin was fired from the band after the photo shoot for the album cover of Hearts on the Line, and was replaced in the studio by Dennis Belfield on bass. Mickey McGee was also replaced on drums by Ron Krasinsky, for the recordings. The success of the Burrito Brothers marked the first time in the band's 11-year history of having any serious chart success. During their span as a country hit act, they scored nine hits for Curb Records.  Despite this success, the album is currently unavailable."

It was the third and final release for the band as a trio, which was their most successful and recognisable line-up. Released in September 1985, it peaked at no. 5 in the UK, and no. 20 in the US. Before the album's release, the Thompson Twins performed at Live Aid in July 1985, where they revealed their new material by playing a rock oriented version of the Beatles' song \"Revolution\". The band were also joined onstage for this number by Rodgers himself, Madonna, and guitarist Steve Stevens. Although the album was a chart success in the UK and the US, it was considerably less successful than their previous album Into the Gap. Subsequent singles from the album also met with mixed results. The new Nile Rodgers-produced version of \"Lay Your Hands on Me\" (now with a more distinct gospel sound) reached No. 6 in the United States, while the next UK single \"Don't Mess With Doctor Dream\" reached No. 15. \"King for a Day\" followed in both markets, peaking at No. 8 in the US and becoming their third and final Top 10 hit there, but only reaching No. 22 in the UK. The aforementioned \"Revolution\" was also released as a single in the UK, but failed to make the top 40, signifying an end to the Thompson Twins' commercial viability there. The US and Canadian pressing of the vinyl album does not include the track \"Breakaway\" but contained a new, Nile Rodgers-produced version of the track \"Roll Over\", though the song was omitted altogether in all other countries.

        "content": "Panda Bear is the self-titled debut solo album by the Baltimore musician Noah Lennox who later became a founding member of Animal Collective. The album was the first use of the Panda Bear moniker which he later continued to use while performing with group.  It was released on June 1, 1999 shortly before his 21st birthday on the label Soccer Star Records. The label was formed by himself and fellow future Animal Collective member and childhood friend Deakin (Joshua Dibb) and was initially founded only to release this album. However the label eventually morphed into Animal and then Paw Tracks. This album marks the very first Animal Collective related release, apart from the EP \"Paddington Band\", which was a recording by the Animal Collective precursor Automine, which featured all other members of the future group except for Lennox himself. The exact number of compact discs produced is unknown, but can be assumed to be small because the label had no distribution network at the time. It was likely paid out of pocket by Lennox and Dibb themselves. The aforementioned factors as well as lack of awareness and interest led to the album becoming out of print. Lennox commented on the possibility of a reissue in 2004."

Musically, \"Early Winter\" is a soft rock and synth-pop ballad with new wave influences. Critics found it similar to songs by English alternative rock band Keane, of which Rice-Oxley is a member. The lyrics of the song describe the nearing of the end of a relationship, and were speculated to be references to Stefani's own relationship with husband Gavin Rossdale. Upon its release, \"Early Winter\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom commended Stefani's vocal delivery and the song's emotional appeal. The song attained moderate commercial success across Europe, reaching number six in Germany and Slovakia, number 12 in Switzerland, and number 14 in Finland. An accompanying music video for \"Early Winter\" was directed by Sophie Muller and was filmed in destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague. It contains scenes of Stefani in a palace-like hall in various gowns and at railway stations. \"Early Winter\" was included in the setlist of The Sweet Escape Tour, and the performances featured a special coda section delivered by American musician and bassist Gail Ann Dorsey."

Recorded in east London's Miloco Studios with producers James Ford and Mike Crossey, the album was preceded by the release of \"Brianstorm\" on 16 April 2007. This is the band's first album with bassist Nick O'Malley, replacing their previous bassist Andy Nicholson, who left the band before the North America tour of the band's debut studio album. In comparison to the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, the album is considered more ambitious, with ambient sounds and expanded drum rhythms being introduced. Like Arctic Monkey's debut, Favourite Worst Nightmare was a widespread critical success, with critics highlighting the band's new emotional depth and Turner's matured songwriting. NME and Uncut ranked it the second-best album of 2007, while Dutch publication OOR named it the best of 2007. In retrospect, the album is considered the start of the band's change of sound with each of their albums after their debut. In its first week of release, the album sold over 227,000 copies, going straight to number one in the UK Albums Chart. \"Brianstorm\" and \"Fluorescent Adolescent\" were also both hits on the UK Singles Chart, with the former reaching number two on the chart. In the United States, the album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, selling around 44,000 copies in its first week. The album has since gone 3\u00d7 platinum in the UK. It was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize and won Best British Album at the 2008 BRIT Awards."

        "content": "\"Saint Dominic's Preview\" is the title song of the sixth album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in July 1972 by Warner Bros. It was recorded at the Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco in April 1972, with overdubs made later on. Morrison wrote it in a stream of consciousness in the same vein as some of his earlier works, particularly those on Astral Weeks. The  song's narrative moves from France to San Francisco, Morrison's place of residence at the time, to Belfast, where he grew up, to New York City (\"52nd Street apartment\"). Saint Dominic's Preview has been described as one of his most allusive, containing wide-ranging references including The Troubles, Morrison's pre-fame career cleaning windows, Notre-Dame cathedral and the vicissitudes of the recording industry. The song also mentions Edith Piaf, Irish poet W. B. Yeats, country singer Hank Williams and the California supermarket chain Safeway. Gary Mallaber and Jack Schroer (from the Moondance album) play drums and saxophone respectively and Morrison's then wife, Janet Planet, is one of the back-up vocalists. \"Saint Dominic's Preview\" has also been released on the live recordings It's Too Late to Stop Now and Van Morrison in Ireland, as well as the compilation album Still on Top - The Greatest Hits."

The EP garnered warm critical reception, with independent music website Delusions of Adequacy praising \"the cathartic racket\" of the songs as \"uplifting and expansive, on the verge of overwhelming with sound, sweeping the listener away from the harsh, earth-bound lyrics and delivery\" and hailing the EP as \"a bracing distillation of what The Twilight Sad does best, marrying spare to expansive sonics with bitter, sharp, sometimes enigmatic lyrics and a powerful, emotional sing-talking delivery by James Graham, as skeletons are rattled in the old family closet.\""

Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards recording on \"Till the Next Goodbye\" began at Munich's Musicland Studios in November 1973. The song is a traditional ballad from the Stones' middle period, with slight country music influences. It opens with an acoustic guitar which leads into Jagger's performance. The lyrics deal with the \"illicit meetings between two lovers\"; The song's chorus is notable as the title is elongated into the phrase \"Till the next time we say goodbye.\" {{cquote|Yeah, a movie house on 42nd Street, Ain't a very likely place for you and I to meet; Watching the snow swirl around your hair and around your feet; And I'm thinking to myself 'she surely looks a treat'''}} In his review of the song, Bill Janovitz says, \"In the mid-'70s, a 42nd Street movie theater would have been a place of questionable repute and not a very romantic rendezvous. The lyric is unexpectedly complex; the point of view, Jagger as narrator, speaks to the mistress apologetically and with a guilty conscience... In one line on the bridge, Jagger manages to convey empathy, culpability, and frustration: 'I can't go on like this/Can you? Can you?' On paper it seems clear, the narrator is asking out of the relationship (paraphrasing): 'I can't do this, can you?' But the way Jagger sings it, it sounds like he's asking, 'You can't do this anymore, can you?' He's conveying a different meaning altogether, almost as if he is playing both parts in one line.\" Recording continued at Jagger's home in Newbury with the use of the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio and finished at Island Recording Studios in London. Jagger, Richards and Mick Taylor each perform acoustic guitar for the piece. Taylor also contributes electric slide guitar to the recording. Nicky Hopkins performs the song's piano. Bill Wyman performs bass while Charlie Watts performs drums. An overlooked song from the Stones canon of work, \"Till the Next Goodbye\" has never been performed live by the Stones and was not included on any compilation albums until the release of the Heartbreak'' EP in early 2021. The song was rehearsed on 11 February 2014 in Paris, in preparation for the Rolling Stones 14 On Fire Asia Pacific Tour, which started in Abu Dhabi on 21 February 2014.

        "content": "\"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" is a song recorded by the American quartet Four Tops for their third studio album, On Top (1966). It was released in February 1966 as a 7\" vinyl single through Motown records. It was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland. A gospel rock track, its lyrics detail a relationship that has ended. It has since been regarded as one of Four Tops' most successful singles ever. It charted moderately well in both the United States and Canada, and became the group's fifth consecutive entry to chart within the top five of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Four Tops has performed \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" on various occasions throughout their careers and have included it on several greatest hits albums, including on The Four Tops Greatest Hits (1967) and The Ultimate Collection (1997). American musicians Barbra Streisand and Carol Lloyd also recorded covers of \"Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)\" and released them commercially in 1975 and 1979, respectively. Included on her seventeenth studio album, Lazy Afternoon (1975), Streisand's version was more of a disco song, as accomplished by producers Jeffrey Lesser and Rupert Holmes. Following the success of the song in a New York City club, Columbia Records decided to release the single which would later become a moderate success on two Billboard dance charts in that same year. Critically, it was highlighted on Lazy Afternoon as a standout track. Lloyd's version was recorded for her debut record Score in 1979; it received heavy airplay by disc jockeys and was positively received by Billboard critics."

Following Adele's graduation from the BRIT School in April 2006, she began publishing songs and recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend, who posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to interest from the record label. This led to Adele signing a recording contract at age 17 with the label and providing vocals for Jack Pe\u00f1ate. During this session for Pe\u00f1ate's song she met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album. Named after the age of the singer during its release and production, Adele wrote most of the album's material solely, but did work with a select few writers and producers including Jim Abbiss, Eg White and Sacha Skarbek. Their collaborations created a blue-eyed soul album with folk rock, indie pop, and jazz influences and lyrics describing heartbreak, nostalgia and relationships. Upon release, 19 received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Adele's vocal prowess and songwriting talent at such a young age and noted her as having the \"potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation.\" 19 also won numerous accolades including the Mercury Prize and the European Border Breakers Award. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, Adele won Best New Artist alongside Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Chasing Pavements\". Four singles were released from the album, with \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Make You Feel My Love\" reaching the top ten on the UK Singles Chart, while the former became Adele's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also contains her first song, \"Hometown Glory\", written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of West Norwood in London. 19 became a global success, reaching number one in Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, while top 10 in fifteen countries including Australia, Brazil and the United States. The album is certified 8x platinum by the BPI with sales of over 2.4 million, while 3x platinum in the US by RIAA, having sold over 3 million copies.

        "content": "\"Wreck on the Highway\" is a song written and performed by Bruce Springsteen.  It was originally released as the final track on his fifth album, The River.  The version released on The River was recorded at The Power Station in New York in March\u2013April 1980.  As well as being the last track on The River, it was the last song recorded for the album. A melancholic song with a false ending, \"Wreck on the Highway\" features prominent organ and acoustic guitar parts.  The song is structured as a folk ballad with four verses of five lines each.  The rhyming pattern of the verse endings is generally A-B-C-C-B, but this is not followed absolutely strictly.  The lyrics describe a man who witnesses a hit-and-run auto accident on a rainy, isolated highway, and is subsequently haunted by the vision and unable to sleep.  After the first three verses focus on the specific incident, the last verse broadens the theme to encompass more universal themes of life and death.  The singer thinks about the life that was lost, and the people who may have loved him, and he knows he will be haunted by the incident for the rest of his life.  Springsteen has explained the theme by stating that after seeing the accident the singer \"realizes that you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be part of something, to parent your children, to do something good.\"  It is directly inspired by Roy Acuff's country song of the same name and similar theme from the 1940s, which is a cover version of the 1938 recorded song, \"I Didn't Hear Nobody Pray\", by the Dixon Brothers. While Springsteen's song has elements of a country arrangement, its music is more haunted and less sentimental. Along with the title track, \"Independence Day\" and \"Point Blank\", it is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. \"Wreck on the Highway\" and a few other songs on The River, such as the title track and \"Stolen Car\", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting: these ballads imbued with a sense of hopelessness anticipate his next album, Nebraska, as well as a turn towards pessimism in his overall artistic and personal world-view. Springsteen himself has noted that \"Wreck on the Highway\" is one of the songs reflecting a shift in his songwriting style, linking The River to Nebraska. A slow-tempo song, \"Wreck on the Highway\" has not been particularly common in concert, with about 100 performances in Bruce Springsteen concerts through 2008.  Nearly all of those performances occurred during the 1980\u20131981 River Tour. The song was revived occasionally for electric piano performances on the 2005 solo Devils & Dust Tour. Naturally, the song was played every night during the 2016 \"River Tour\" during which the entire album was played at the outset of each show. In the UK, it was released as the B-side of the single \"Cadillac Ranch\"."

Big Boi initially achieved success as a member of the hip hop duo Outkast with fellow rapper Andr\u00e9 3000; they have recorded and released six studio albums together, and the singles \"Ms. Jackson\", \"Hey Ya!\" (performed solely by 3000) and \"The Way You Move\" (performed solely by Big Boi) have all topped the US Billboard Hot 100. In 1995, Big Boi made a guest appearance on the single \"Dirty South\" by American hip hop group Goodie Mob, which peaked at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he made several other appearances on commercially successful singles, including \"All n My Grill\" by rapper Missy Elliott, \"A.D.I.D.A.S.\" by rapper Killer Mike and \"Girlfight\" by singer Brooke Valentine; these songs charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Big Boi released his first two solo singles \u2013 \"Royal Flush\" and \"Sumthin's Gotta Give\" \u2013 in 2008, with \"Ringtone\" following in 2009. All three songs were recorded for his purported debut studio album Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty: however, due to legal complications resulting from Big Boi's departure from his former record label Jive Records, the album's release was considerably delayed and was not released until 2010. The eventual first single from Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty, titled \"Shutterbugg\", peaked at number 60 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, as well as number 32 on the UK Singles Chart and number 13 on the UK R&B Chart. The album spawned the single \"Follow Us\", a collaboration with rock group Vonnegutt. Following its eventual release, Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty debuted at number 3 on the US Billboard 200, and appeared on several other national album charts. Big Boi's second studio album, Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors, was released on December 11, 2012 in the United States, and peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200 in the first week following its release. The album was preceded by the release of the singles \"Gossip\", \"She Said OK\" and \"Mama Told Me\"."

These tracks were made available on Walker's Myspace site in demo form in late 2007. Butch stated in an interview with InklingsTV that \"[the fires] made [him] feel like [he] had something to prove, something that [he] needed to say\".  The physical packaging of the album is, according to Walker, very 'bare-bones', because he wanted it to be 'all about what's on the disc'. The album was acclaimed by music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100, Sycamore Meadows holds a rating of 81/100, indicating universal acclaim. Butch released an online-only video for the first single \"Ships in a Bottle\" through his Myspace website on September 15, 2008. The music video for the second single \"The Weight of Her\" premiered on Amazon.com on November 24, 2008.

The album featured contributions from many of the same session musicians and friends that had played on Hansson's previous album, Magician's Hat.  In Hansson's native Sweden, Attic Thoughts was released with the Swedish title of Mellanv\u00e4sen. It was released with its English title in April 1975 by Charisma Records, but was less commercially successful than Hansson's preceding solo albums and failed to reach the charts in the UK or the United States.  In addition to featuring Hansson's usual blend of other-worldly progressive rock and fairy tale-like ambiance, Attic Thoughts includes a suite named \"Rabbit Music\", which was inspired by Richard Adams' novel Watership Down, a subject that Hansson would explore further on his 1977 album Music Inspired by Watership Down."

However, their next single, the Smokey Robinson-produced \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\", would reach the Top 20 of the U.S. pop chart, breaking the group's streak of being \"hitless\"."

It was first released on March 9, 2010, in various countries via digital download as the album's lead single by Fueled by Ramen. McCoy co-wrote the song with its producers Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of the Smeezingtons. The song was created from a melody hummed by Mars and Lawrence. The lyrics were written during an eleven-day trip Mars and Levine made to London to work on a record, supported by Mars's label. \"Billionaire\" is a reggae and pop-rap song. Critical reception towards the song was mixed, as music critics praised the song's style comparing it to the music of Sublime, Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson, but criticized its songwriting. Lyrically, the song has a money-driven hook with political elements in the verses. Such elements include helping those in need, having a show like Oprah and being on the cover of Forbes magazine once McCoy becomes a billionaire. The single reached number one in the Netherlands, number two in Ireland and New Zealand, and also reached the top five in the United Kingdom and the United States. It was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and two-times by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and Music Canada (MC). The accompanying music video for \"Billionaire\", directed by Mark Staubach, was filmed at various locations in Los Angeles, California. It features McCoy driving a Mini Cooper with Mars in the passenger seat. Mars and McCoy, with former Fall Out Boy Pete Wentz on the back, are shown riding different scooters. The video is interpolated with footage of McCoy helping four people, as well a large group at the end. McCoy and Mars performed the song live on Jay Leno's The Tonight Show and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. It was also part of Mars's Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show in 2014. The song was re-recorded by Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte; her version outperformed the original single reaching number three on the Billboard Brazil Hot 100 Airplay chart. The television show soundtracks of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Housewife used the song."

The song features verses from rapper Snoop Dogg. The artists co-wrote the song with Bonnie McKee and its co-producers Dr. Luke and Max Martin, with additional production from Benny Blanco. According to Perry, \"California Gurls\" is an answer song to \"Empire State of Mind\" (2009), by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. Its midtempo production incorporates disco-pop and funk-pop with influences of new wave and electropop. Its lyrics are an ode to the state of California, in which both Perry and Snoop Dogg were born and raised. \"California Gurls\" garnered positive reviews from music critics, with the majority of them labeling it a \"summer anthem\", as well as complimenting its production and chorus. Originally, the song was intended to be sent to mainstream and rhythmic airplay on May 25, 2010, the song debuted on May 7, 2010, after clips from the Teenage Dream album were leaked online. It was subsequently released to iTunes on May 11, 2010, as the album's lead single. The song was a worldwide success, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks, giving Perry her second number-one single in the US and Snoop Dogg his third. The song also reached number-one in seven other countries, was the bestselling song of 2010 in Canada, and is certified Platinum or higher in nine countries, including 4x Platinum in Canada, 6x Platinum in Australia, and 8x Platinum in the US. A music video for the song was released on June 15, 2010, featuring Perry and her dancers as pieces of a board game, set in the fictional \"Candyfornia\". Perry has said that the inspiration behind the video was artist Will Cotton, who was also the artistic director of the video. It has also been noted that the video was influenced by several other works, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and the board game Candyland. On December 2, 2010, the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. In 2012, Billboard ranked the song number one on a special The 30 Summer Songs of All Time listing."

In July 2008, LMFAO released the EP Party Rock. The following year, their debut studio album of the same name was released; it peaked at number 33 on the US Billboard 200.

        "content": "\"Romeo Is Bleeding\" is a song written and performed by Tom Waits, and released on his 1978 album, Blue Valentine. The lyrics make frequent use of Spanish, including phrases such as \"Hey Pachuco!\", \"D\u00e1me esa pistola, hombre!\" (Give me that pistol, man!), \"Hijo de la chingada madre!\" (You son of a fucking whore!), and \"Vamos a dormir, hombre\" (Let's go to sleep, man). Waits also makes a reference to gangster movie-star James Cagney, also mentioned in \"Invitation to the Blues\" from the album Small Change. Jay S. Jacobs, in his book Wild years: the music and myth of Tom Waits, describes \"Romeo is Bleeding\" as depicting \"a guy who sticks a shiv into the local sheriff [and] is fatally shot in the chest \u2014 a familiar Waits image, with echoes of West Side Story\". Waits had more overtly referenced West Side Story earlier on the Blue Valentine album, with \"Somewhere\" as the opening track. According to Waits, the song is based on a real incident in Los Angeles, and concerns \"a Mexican gang leader who was shot and died in a movie house in downtown L.A.\" Music critic Adrian Denning wrote that \"one song that would, could and SHOULD rank amongst [Waits'] finest moments is the fabulous Jazz swing and late night seedy feel of 'Romeo is Bleeding.'\" While lukewarm towards Blue Valentine in general, Denning remarked that the song \"corrects matters somewhat,\" citing the song's \"great vocals and... bass groove.\" Robert Christgau wrote that \"Romeo is Bleeding\" was \"easily my favorite among his Chandleroid sagas of tragedy outside the law,\" but added that it is \"more effective on the jacket than when he [Waits] underlines its emotional resonance in song.\" Patrick Humphries, in his book The many lives of Tom Waits, was unimpressed, labelling the song a \"rewrite\" of Waits' 1976 song, \"Small Change.\" The song later lent its name to the Peter Medak film Romeo Is Bleeding, which starred Gary Oldman."

When Pete Burns saw the video, he sent Boy George a wreath. In many countries, the single was released with a B-Side consisting of a native-language version (Spanish, French, Japanese or German) of the song. It was available in two different extended versions, a first in Culture Club discography. Its 7\" picture disc was shelved, and remaining copies are very rare.

Goodbye Lullaby is Lavigne's third and final studio album released by RCA, following The Best Damn Thing (2007). Upon its release, Goodbye Lullaby received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with some naming it her most personal and introspective album while others took issue with its subdued sound and Lavigne's lyrical content. The album debuted inside the top five in over 15 countries such as the United States and Canada (where it has since been certified gold) and topping the charts in over eight countries, such as Australia, Greece, Hong Kong and Japan. Three singles were released from Goodbye Lullaby. \"What the Hell\" was released as the lead single in January 2011 and achieved worldwide chart success, reaching the top 20 in the United States and United Kingdom, the top ten in Europe and Australia and the top five in Asia. The following singles, \"Smile\" and \"Wish You Were Here\", had moderate chart success worldwide.

More negative feedback called the songs forgettable and too similar to other artists in the industry. The album was reissued in Denmark on 5 December 2011 and featured five previously unreleased bonus tracks. Five singles were released from the album, including lead single \"Sun of a Gun\" which charted in five countries. \"White Nights\" and \"Speak Out Now\" both charted within the top 20 in Denmark and were certified gold for sales of over 10,000 copies each. \"Wolf & I\" and \"Voodoo\" were released exclusively in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively.

He was a prolific composer; there are a great many recordings of all of his music\u2014both popular and classical; and it would be impossible to list all of them.  Indeed, there are new performances and recordings of Rota's music being made to this day. Nino Rota is best known for his many film scores\u2014in particular for the seminal Fellini films La Strada (1954), La Dolce Vita (1960), 8 1/2 (1963), Juliet of the Spirits (1965), and Amarcord (1974). He also wrote the scores for Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968), Luchino Visconti's The Leopard, and Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II.  For Fellini alone, Rota produced almost 80 film scores starting with The White Sheik in 1952 and ending with the unfairly forgotten Orchestra Rehearsal in 1979, the year of the composer's death. Rota's film scores were a great commercial success.  The soundtrack album of Romeo and Juliet, with combined dialogue and music, reached number two and spent 74 weeks on the Billboard charts. The theme song for La Strada sold more than two million copies in Italy alone. The film scores won many awards. For example, the score for The Godfather was nominated for an Oscar, won a British Academy Film Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Grammy. Less well known is the fact that Rota was a prolific composer of chamber music, operas, and orchestral pieces. In all he produced four symphonies, twelve operas, five ballets, three piano concertos, three cello concertos, various choral works, and dozens of chamber works\u2014the best known being his Concerto for Strings."

Michael Baskette, who worked with Radke on Escape the Fate's Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, returned as the executive producer for the album, alongside former bandmate Omar Espinosa and others as additional composers and production aids in the studio. The Drug in Me Is You was released on July 25, 2011, in Europe and Japan, and on July 26, 2011, in the United States. The album charted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies in its first week in the United States. It also charted internationally on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. By December 2019, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Upon release, The Drug in Me Is You received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being clich\u00e9 while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band in many of the album's tracks. The Drug in Me Is You was chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011. It is the only album that features founding bassist Nason Schoeffler and drummer Scott Gee."

It is Lucassen's first solo album since 1993's Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy, released 18 years earlier under the name Anthony, before he reached fame with his progressive metal/rock opera project Ayreon. Lucassen wrote all the songs, sings lead vocals and performs most instruments himself, including all guitars, bass and keyboards. As with Ayreon, it is a concept album. It follows the story of Mr. L (voiced by Lucassen), a modern-day man revived in a distant future where everything has changed. Although the story is not a part of the Ayreon storyline, it is set within the same fictional universe: the character of Mr. L had previously appeared in the song \"The Truth is in Here\" from 01011001, while the cover art includes the Dream Sequencer from the Ayreon album Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer. The album also prominently features spoken vocals performed by actor Rutger Hauer as Mr. L's appointed psychological advisor, Voight-Kampff, in reference to the eponymous fictional polygraph-like device in Blade Runner, in which Hauer starred. Music videos were released for \"Pink Beatles in a Purple Zeppelin\" and \"E-police\". Lucassen also released a music video for \"Lost in the New Real\", which also acts practically as an introduction to the album."

Most of the songs are political in nature, but a Christmas song, \"We\u2019re Following the Wrong Star\", is also included. Describing why he decided to release this album, Bragg said... \"Since I started giving away music for free on the internet in 2002 with The Price of Oil, I\u2019ve felt a little bit like I\u2019ve been pissing in the wind, so to speak, that the ideas that I\u2019ve been putting out there have not really been in keeping with what\u2019s going on in the music industry. But the last couple of years, since the crash in 2008, I think the idea of polemical songs has become more and more relevant, so it now seems like a good time to collect these together and make them available for people who may only have tuned in a few years ago.\""

The song reached #6 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart and #40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965; it was Sherman's last top-40 hit.

At first, the parents are relieved that they can now use the phone and the bath tub but, as the hours pass, they get increasingly nervous. Meanwhile their offspring  frug to the songs of Petula Clark while they are downtown. Eventually, the parents take Miltown in order to calm themselves down. However the father gets a phone call telling him that their children have been arrested as the result of a car accident, prompting him to angrily borrow someone else's car to get his sons home. He then vows to ground the teenagers and go downtown with his wife, where he promises to do \"very nice dances\" including the tango, waltz, foxtrot, and bunny hop, instead of the dances of the younger generation such as the Frug, the Swim, the Mashed Potato or the Jerk."

It was produced by Danger Mouse, with additional production from Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The album was announced at an Apple Inc. product launch event and released the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. It was exclusive to iTunes, iTunes Radio, and Beats Music until 13 October 2014, when it received a physical release on Island and Interscope Records. The digital release made the record available to more than 500\u00a0million iTunes customers, for what Apple CEO Tim Cook marketed as \"the largest album release of all time\". After the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of their previous record, No Line on the Horizon (2009), lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty about the band's ability to remain musically relevant. During the five-and-a-half-year gestation period for Songs of Innocence\u2014the longest gap between albums of their career\u2014the group reportedly worked on several projects with multiple producers, including an aborted companion to their previous record called Songs of Ascent. However, they struggled to complete an album to their satisfaction and continually delayed a release. After working with Danger Mouse for two years, the group collaborated with Flood, Epworth, and Tedder to complete Songs of Innocence. Thematically, it revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to musical inspirations Ramones and the Clash. Bono described it as \"the most personal album we've written\". The lead single \"The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)\" was featured in an Apple television advertisement as part of a promotional campaign for the band on which the company reportedly spent US$100\u00a0million. Approximately 81\u00a0million iTunes users listened to the album in its first month of release, 26\u00a0million of whom downloaded the entire record. Songs of Innocence received generally mixed reviews and drew criticism for its digital release; the album was automatically added to users' iTunes accounts, which for many triggered an unprompted download to their electronic devices. Upon its commercial release, Songs of Innocence sold just 101,000 copies in North America and charted for just eight and nine weeks in the US and UK, respectively. The group's press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident. The record received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Album. U2 supported the album with the successful Innocence + Experience Tour in 2015, and followed it up with a companion record, Songs of Experience, in 2017."
