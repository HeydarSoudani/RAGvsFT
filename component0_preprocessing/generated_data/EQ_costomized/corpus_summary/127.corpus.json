        "content": "Holden, formerly known as General Motors-Holden, was an Australian automobile marque owned by General Motors and as well a former automobile manufacturer, which manufactured cars in Australia before switching to importing cars under the Holden brand. It was headquartered in Port Melbourne. The company was founded in 1856 as a saddlery manufacturer in South Australia. In 1908, it moved into the automotive field before later becoming a subsidiary of the United States\u2013based General Motors (GM) in 1931, when the company was renamed General Motors-Holden's Ltd. It was renamed Holden Ltd in 1998, adopting the name GM Holden Ltd in 2005. In the past, Holden has offered badge-engineered models due to sharing arrangements with Chevrolet, Isuzu, Nissan, Opel, Suzuki, Toyota, and Vauxhall Motors. In previous years, the vehicle lineup consisted of models from GM Korea, GM Thailand, GM North America, and self-developed models like the Holden Commodore, Holden Caprice, and the Holden Ute. Holden also distributed the European Opel brand in Australia in 2012 until its Australian demise in mid-2013. Holden briefly owned assembly plants in New Zealand during the early 1990s. The plants had belonged to General Motors  from 1926 until 1990 in an earlier and quite separate operation from GM's Holden investment in Australia. From 1994 to 2017, all Australian-built Holden vehicles were manufactured in Elizabeth, South Australia, and engines were produced at the Fishermans Bend plant in Melbourne. Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland states of Australia. The consolidation of final assembly at Elizabeth was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at Dandenong, Victoria until 1994. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability . From 2010, Holden incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and reductions of government grants and subsidies. This led to the announcement, on 11 December 2013, that Holden would cease vehicle and engine production by the end of 2017. On 20 October 2017, the last existing vehicle plant, located in Elizabeth, was closed as the production of the Holden Commodore ended. On 17 February 2020, General Motors announced that the Holden brand would be retired by 2021. It has been replaced by GM Specialty Vehicles (GMSV), which imports the Chevrolet Silverado and will also import the Chevrolet Corvette."

Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016. The company was founded as Activision, Inc. on October 1, 1979 in Sunnyvale, California, by former Atari game developers upset at their treatment by Atari in order to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The 1983 video game crash, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games and forced the company to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself to Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around  by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991. Kotick drastically revamped and restructured the company to get it out of debt: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from its former financial troubles, started acquiring numerous studios and various types of intellectual property over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series. A holding company was formed as Activision's parent company to manage both its internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding company merged with Vivendi Games (the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision manages numerous third-party studios and publishes all games besides those created by Blizzard."

It was the home ballpark of the New York Yankees, one of the city's Major League Baseball franchises, from 1923 to 2008, except for 1974-75 when the stadium was renovated. It hosted 6,581 Yankees regular season home games during its 85-year history. It was also the home of the New York Giants National Football League (NFL) team from 1956 through September 1973. The stadium's nickname, \"The House That Ruth Built\", is derived from Babe Ruth, the baseball superstar whose prime years coincided with the stadium's opening and the beginning of the Yankees' winning history. It has often been referred to as \"The Cathedral of Baseball\". The stadium was built from 1922 to 1923 for $2.4\u00a0million ($345\u00a0million in 2019 dollars). Its construction was paid for entirely by Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert, who was eager to have his own stadium after sharing the Polo Grounds with the New York Giants baseball team the previous ten years. Located only a half-mile (0.8\u00a0km) north of the upper Manhattan location of the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium opened for the 1923 season and was hailed at the time as a one-of-a-kind facility in the country. Over the course of its history, Yankee Stadium became one of the most famous venues in the United States, having hosted a variety of events and historic moments during its existence. While many of these moments were baseball-related\u2014including World Series games, no-hitters, perfect games, and historic home runs\u2014the stadium also hosted boxing matches, the 1958 NFL Championship Game (referred to as The Greatest Game Ever Played), college football, concerts, Jehovah's Witnesses conventions (see record attendance), and three Papal Masses. The stadium went through many alterations and playing surface configurations over the years. The condition of the facility worsened in the 1960s and 1970s, prompting its closure for renovation from October 1973 through 1975. The renovation significantly altered the appearance of the venue and reduced the distance of the outfield fences. In 2006, the Yankees began building a new $2.3\u00a0billion stadium in public parkland adjacent to the stadium, which included $1.2\u00a0billion in public subsidies. The design includes a replica of the frieze along the roof that had been part of the original Yankee Stadium. Monument Park, a Hall of Fame for prominent former Yankees, was relocated to the new stadium. Yankee Stadium closed following the 2008 season and the new stadium opened in 2009, adopting the \"Yankee Stadium\" moniker. The original Yankee Stadium was demolished in 2010, two years after it closed, and the  site was converted into a public park called Heritage Field."

The British branch of the label was founded on 8 August 1923 as the Parlophone Company Limited (the Parlophone Co. Ltd.), which developed a reputation in the 1920s as a jazz record label. On 5 October 1926, the Columbia Graphophone Company acquired Parlophone's business, name, logo, and release library, and merged with the Gramophone Company on 31 March 1931 to become Electric & Musical Industries Limited (EMI). George Martin joined Parlophone in 1950 as assistant to Oscar Preuss (who had set up the London branch of the company in 1923), the label manager, taking over as manager in 1955. Martin produced and released a mix of recordings, including by comedian Peter Sellers, pianist Mrs Mills, and teen idol Adam Faith. In 1962, Martin signed the Beatles, a beat group from Liverpool who earlier that year had been rejected by Decca Records. During the 1960s, when Cilla Black, Billy J. Kramer, the Fourmost, and the Hollies also signed, Parlophone became one of the world's most famous labels. For several years, Parlophone claimed the best-selling UK single, \"She Loves You\", and the best-selling UK album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, both by the Beatles. The label placed seven singles at number 1 during 1964, when it claimed top spot on the UK Albums Chart for 40 weeks.

Newton returned here in 1666 when Cambridge University closed due to the plague, and here, he performed many of his most famous experiments, most notably his work on light and optics. This is also said to be the site where Newton, observing an apple fall from a tree, was inspired to formulate his law of universal gravitation. Now in the hands of the National Trust and open to the public all year round, it is presented as a typical seventeenth century yeoman's farmhouse (or as near to that as possible, taking into account modern living, health and safety requirements and structural changes that have been made to the house since Newton's time). New areas of the house, once private, were opened up to the public in 2003, with the old rear steps (that once led up to the hay loft and grain store and often seen in drawings of the period) being rebuilt, and the old walled kitchen garden, to the rear of the house, being restored.

In its first three years, Susning.nu ran as an open wiki that anyone could edit. Susning did not have a pronounced ambition and could be compared in scope to Everything2; Aronsson's stated original aim for Susning was \"to make it into whatever the users want it to be\". As such, Susning was an encyclopedia, a dictionary, and a discussion forum about any concept of interest to its users. Because of this, Susning grew and became Sweden's biggest and the world's next biggest wiki. At its peak in April 2004, Susning had over 60,000 articles on various topics, which was more than any other Swedish wiki at that time. During its first few years, it was in direct competition with the Swedish Wikipedia. However, because of the website's popularity, Susning was highly affected by vandals. In attempt at preventing vandalism, many efforts were made by Susning's founder Lars Aronsson, which were mostly unsuccessful. Users who regularly edited at Susning were called \"susare\"."

        "content": "The Saturn Corporation, also known as Saturn LLC, was an American automobile manufacturer, a registered trademark established on January 7, 1985, as a subsidiary of General Motors. The company was an attempt by GM to compete directly with Japanese imports and transplants, initially in the US compact car market. The brand marketed itself as a \"different kind of car company\" and operated quasi-independently from its parent company, \u2014 comprehensively introducing a new car, dealer network, pricing structure, workforce and independently managed manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The first cars themselves launched five years after the company's inception, and they advanced GM's spaceframe construction \u2014 manifesting Saturn's market proposition with their dent-resistant polymer exterior panels. Over time, as Saturn drained resources from GM's extensive brand network and as GM struggled with the 2008 economic collapse, the parent company curtailed Saturn's development budgets \u2014 leaving Saturn to badge engineer products from other divisions, notably a series of federalized models from Opel.  With this, Saturn gradually lost its unique selling proposition, and the market lost interest.  Annual sales achieved their highest level in 1994, with 286,003 vehicles marketed. Following a failed attempt by Penske Automotive to acquire Saturn in September 2009, GM ended production in October of 2009, ended outstanding franchises in October of 2010 and discontinued the brand \u2014 25 years after it began."

Even after the release of the Pentium 4 in late 2000, the Pentium III continued to be produced with new models introduced until early 2003, and were discontinued in April 2004 for desktop units, and May 2007 for mobile units."

It was founded by Berry Gordy Jr. as Tamla Records on January 12, 1959, and incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960. Its name, a portmanteau of motor and town, has become a nickname for Detroit, where the label was originally headquartered. Motown played an important role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned label that achieved  crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including Tamla Motown, the brand used outside the US) were the most of the Motown sound, a style of soul music with a mainstream pop appeal. Motown was the most successful soul music label, with a net worth of $61 million. During the 1960s, Motown achieved 79 records in the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 1969. Following the events of the Detroit Riots of 1967, and the loss of key songwriting/production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland that year over pay disputes, Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles, California. Motown expanded into film and television production. It was an independent company until MCA Records bought it in 1988. PolyGram purchased the label from MCA in 1993, followed by MCA successor Universal Music Group, which acquired PolyGram in 1999. Motown spent much of the 2000s headquartered in New York City as a part of the UMG subsidiaries Universal Motown and Universal Motown Republic Group. From 2011 to 2014, it was a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group division of Universal Music. In 2014, however, UMG announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam, and Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the Capitol Music Group, now operating out of the Capitol Tower. In 2018, Motown was inducted into Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in a ceremony held at the Charles H. Wright Museum."

At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Walt Disney Studios as one of Hollywood's major film studios. Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, the others being 20th Century Studios, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and Searchlight Pictures.

        "content": "Leicester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Leicester in the East Midlands, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of England's football league system, and plays its home matches at the King Power Stadium. The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C., playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football League in 1894 and adopted the name Leicester City in 1919. They moved to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002, which was renamed the King Power Stadium in 2011. Leicester won the 2015\u201316 Premier League, their first top tier title, becoming one of seven clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. A number of newspapers described Leicester's title win as the greatest sporting shock ever; multiple bookmakers had never paid out at such long odds for any sport. As a result, the team was dubbed \"The Unbelievables\", a spin-off harking back to Arsenal's undefeated team \"The Invincibles\". The club's previous highest ever league finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928\u201329, then known as the First Division. Leicester holds a joint-record of seven second-tier titles and have competed in the FA Cup final five times, winning their first title in 2021. They have also won the League Cup three times, in 1963\u20131964, 1996\u20131997 and 1999\u20132000. The club has played in six European competitions to date, notably reaching the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals in 2016\u20132017."

Primarily a video game publisher, it internally developed many of the video games it released while outsourcing others to external companies. It is known for series such as Bomberman, Adventure Island, Star Soldier, and Bonk. Hudson also developed video games released by other publishers such as the Mario Party series from Nintendo. Hudson Soft made the TurboGrafx-16 in association with NEC, to compete against Nintendo, Sega, and SNK, while continuing making games on other platforms, as a third-party developer. The mascot of the company is a bee named Hachisuke. Hudson Soft ceased to exist as a company on March 1, 2012, and merged with Konami Digital Entertainment, which was the surviving entity.

It is part of the Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum Complex, with the adjacent Oakland Arena, near Interstate 880. The Coliseum is the home ballpark of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball. In 2017, the playing surface has been dedicated as Rickey Henderson Field in honor of Major League Baseball Hall of Famer and former Athletics left fielder Rickey Henderson. As a multi-purpose stadium, it was the former home of the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League from 1966 until 1981 (when the team moved to Los Angeles), and again from 1995 until 2019 (when the team moved to Las Vegas). Since then, the stadium has been primarily used for baseball. It was the last remaining stadium in the United States shared by professional baseball and football teams. It has also occasionally been used for soccer, including hosting selected San Jose Earthquakes matches in 2008 and 2009, and during the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The Coliseum has a seating capacity of up to 63,132 depending on its configuration; an upper deck dubbed \"Mount Davis\" by fans was added as part of a 1996 renovation for the Raiders' return to Oakland. In 2006, citing a desire to provide a more \"intimate\" environment, the Athletics blocked off the entirety of the Coliseum's third deck during its games, which artificially limited its capacity to 34,077 (making it the smallest stadium in Major League Baseball). In 2013, the Raiders also began to restrict their use of Mount Davis due to the NFL's blackout rules, reducing football capacity by around 11,000. On April 11, 2017, with Dave Kaval as the then-new team president, the Athletics began to reopen some of the sections in the third deck, and open the Mount Davis deck for selected marquee games. While an NFL venue, the stadium was the second-smallest NFL stadium, larger only than Dignity Health Sports Park, the former temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers."

        "content": "The Blackwall Tunnel is a pair of road tunnels underneath the River Thames in east London, England, linking the London Borough of Tower Hamlets with the Royal Borough of Greenwich, and part of the A102 road. The northern portal lies just south of the East India Dock Road (A13) in Blackwall; the southern entrances are just south of The O2 on the Greenwich Peninsula. The road is managed by Transport for London (TfL). The tunnel was originally opened as a single bore in 1897 by the then Prince of Wales, as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's East End, and supported a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and vehicular traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate, and consequently a second bore opened in 1967, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handles northbound. The northern approach takes traffic from the A12 and the southern approach takes traffic from the A2, making the tunnel crossing a key link for both local and longer-distance traffic between the north and south sides of the river. It forms part of a key route into Central London from South East London and Kent and was the easternmost all-day crossing for vehicles before the opening of the Dartford Tunnel in 1963. It remains the easternmost free fixed road crossing of the Thames, and regularly suffers congestion, to the extent that tidal flow schemes were in place from 1978 until controversially removed in 2007. Given the very high traffic volumes at the crossing (and the height restrictions of the Victorian bore) the crossing is being supplemented by the Silvertown Tunnel, currently under construction. When the Silvertown Tunnel is completed in 2025, both it and the Blackwall Tunnels will be tolled. The tunnels are no longer open to pedestrians, cyclists or other non-motorised traffic, and the northbound tunnel has a  height limit. The London Buses route 108 between Lewisham and Stratford runs through the tunnels."

The bastion fort was built to guard a portage known as the Oneida Carry during the French and Indian War. Fort Stanwix National Monument, a reconstructed structure built by the National Park Service, now occupies the site. Fort Stanwix is historically significant because of its successful defense by American troops during an August 1777 siege. The fort had been built by the British in 1758 at a strategic site along the water route from Lake Ontario to the Hudson River. After American forces captured and rebuilt the fort during the American Revolutionary War, they were besieged by a British army that invaded from Canada via Lake Ontario, hoping to reach the Hudson River. The British force abandoned the siege, a consequence that helped lead to the defeat of a larger British army during the Saratoga campaign. Fort Stanwix was also the site of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix between Britain and Native American tribes, as well as of the  1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix between the tribes and the American government. Besides the fort reconstruction itself, the national monument includes three short trails that encircle it, one of which follows a portion of the Oneida Carry.  The Marinus Willett Collections Management and Education Center preserves the monument's 485,000 artifacts and documents, displays exhibits about Fort Stanwix and the Mohawk Valley, and serves as a regional tourism center."

It serves as a northern bypass of Detroit, connecting its northern suburbs. The state trunkline highway is also known as the Walter P. Reuther Freeway, named for the prominent auto industry union head by the Michigan Legislature in 1971. I-696 is a bypass route, detouring around the city of Detroit through the city's northern suburbs in Oakland and Macomb counties. It starts by branching off I-96 and I-275 at its western terminus in Farmington Hills, and runs through suburbs including Southfield, Royal Oak and Warren before merging into I-94 at St. Clair Shores on the east end. It has eight lanes for most of its length and is approximately  north of downtown Detroit. I-696 connects to other freeways such as I-75 (Chrysler Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway). Local residents sometimes refer to I-696 as \"The Autobahn of Detroit\". Planning for the freeway started in the 1950s. Michigan state officials proposed the designation I-98, but this was not approved. Construction started on the first segment in 1961, and the Lodge Freeway was designated Business Spur Interstate\u00a0696 (BS I-696) the following year. The western third of the freeway opened in 1963, and the eastern third was completed in January 1979. The central segment was the subject of much controversy during the 1960s and 1970s. Various municipalities along this stretch argued over the routing of the freeway such that the governor locked several officials into a room overnight until they would agree to a routing. Later, various groups used federal environmental regulations to force changes to the freeway. The Orthodox Jewish community in Oak Park was concerned about pedestrian access across the freeway; I-696 was built with a set of parks on overpasses to accommodate their needs. The Detroit Zoo and the City of Detroit also fought components of the freeway design. These concessions delayed the completion of I-696 until December 15, 1989. Since completion, the speed limit was raised from . In addition, some interchanges were reconfigured in 2006."

The modern castle dates from between the 15th and early 17th centuries, when the successive ruling families of the Herberts and the Somersets created a luxurious, fortified castle, complete with a large hexagonal keep, known as the Great Tower or the Yellow Tower of Gwent. Surrounded by parkland, water gardens and terraces, the castle was considered by contemporaries to be the equal of any other in England or Wales. During the English Civil War the castle was held on behalf of Charles I but was taken by Parliamentary forces in 1646. In the aftermath, the castle was slighted, or deliberately put beyond military use; after the restoration of Charles II, the Somersets declined to restore the castle. Raglan Castle became first a source of local building materials, then a romantic ruin. It now attracts visitors as a modern tourist attraction."

In 1980, the club shut down after its founders were convicted for evading taxes. They sold the club to Mark Fleischman, who reopened it, then sold it in 1984 to new owners, who closed it in 1986.

Also a component of the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east\u2013west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north\u2013south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway\u00a0127 (US\u00a0127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. Construction of I-496 started in 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of downtown Lansing were built in the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since."

Originally designed as a baseball venue, the stadium was expanded in later years to accommodate the addition of a professional football team to the city, the Denver Broncos, as well as to improve Denver's hopes of landing a Major League Baseball team. Although the stadium was originally built as a baseball-specific venue, it became more popular as a pro-football stadium despite hosting both sports for a majority of its life. The Broncos called Mile High Stadium home from their beginning in the AFL in 1960 until 2000. The Bears, who changed their name to the Zephyrs in 1985, continued to play in the stadium until 1992 when the franchise was moved to New Orleans. The move was precipitated by the awarding of a Major League Baseball franchise to the city of Denver, and in 1993 the Colorado Rockies season opened in Mile High.

Its address is 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. The building was completed in 1977 with a total of  of working space. It houses the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, the United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Honolulu Division), the offices of Hawaii's U.S. Senators, the offices of Hawaii's U.S. Representatives for Hawaii's 1st congressional district and Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, and branch offices of the United States Secret Service, United States Probation and Pretrial Services System, Department of Homeland Security, United States Department of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, among other entities. The building was named after Prince Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole, heir to the throne of the overthrown Kingdom of Hawaii, who served as Republican territorial delegate to the United States Congress from 1903 through 1922. It was built on part of the former US Army Fort Armstrong, which was named for Samuel C. Armstrong (1839\u20131893), son of Hawaiian missionaries. Across Ala Moana Boulevard is the Aloha Tower at the Honolulu harbor. Other parts of Fort Armstrong became a container terminal for military supplies. The Prince K\u016bhi\u014d Building was constructed to replace the aging Federal Court, Customs House and Post Office building fronting \u02bbIolani Palace and adjacent to Alii\u014dlani Hale which had been built in 1922 and expanded in 1931. After being mostly vacant, the old building was renovated and put up for sale. The old building was given back to the state of Hawaii and was renamed the King David Kal\u0101kaua Building in December 2003. Construction of the Prince K\u016bhi\u014d Federal Building was not without controversy. The General Services Administration wanted a simple tall office tower, while local architects argued for a building more appropriate to Hawaii. Statutes provided that all buildings between the shoreline and the foot of Punchbowl Crater could not be taller than the Hawaii State Capitol. The federal government, not legally limited by local statutes, defied the statutes and constructed the building as the tallest structure in the path of the capitol building's view of the shoreline. The complex includes ten stories of offices (including a penthouse level), connected by an enclosed bridge to a six-story courthouse building (including basement). The Prince K\u016bhi\u014d Federal Building was designed by Joseph G.F. Farrell's firm Architects Hawaii. Other government buildings designed by the firm include the capitol building of Palau, which opened in 2006. The building was selected for $121 million of renovations as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The plan is to make the building more efficient by upgrading its mechanical, electrical, fire-safety, and plumbing systems. It had already been cited as an efficient building by the Energy Star program. Traces of asbestos were discovered during the first phase. The second phase of construction was approved in March 2011."

Campbell Stadium), popularly known as \"Doak\", is a football stadium on the campus of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. It is the home field of the Florida State Seminoles football team of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Opened in 1950, it was originally named Doak Campbell Stadium in honor of Doak S. Campbell, the university's first president. On November 20, 2004, the Florida Legislature added longtime head football coach Bobby Bowden to the stadium name to become Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium. A petition in June 2020 sought to remove Campbell's name, as he resisted racial integration while serving as President of Florida State University. FSU President John E. Thrasher asked Athletics Director David Coburn \"to immediately review this issue and make recommendations to me.\" As of January 2021 no recommendations have been made. The stadium is part of the University Center complex, a mixed-use facility encompassing university office space, university classrooms, the university's Visitor's Center, souvenir store, The University Center Club, and skyboxes and press boxes for use during football games. With a stadium capacity of 79,560, it is the largest continuous brick structure in the United States, the 49th-largest stadium in the world, the second-largest stadium in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and the 18th largest stadium in the NCAA."

It is located some  north-west of Paris and  from Rouen. Construction began in 1196 under the auspices of Richard the Lionheart, who was simultaneously King of England and feudal Duke of Normandy. The castle was expensive to build, but the majority of the work was done in an unusually short period of time. It took just two years and, at the same time, the town of Petit Andely was constructed. Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard has a complex and advanced design, and uses early principles of concentric fortification; it was also one of the earliest European castles to use machicolations. The castle consists of three enclosures separated by dry moats, with a keep in the inner enclosure. Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard was captured in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands several times in the Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to be a threat to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey is open to the public from March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year."

Games played there are said to be played \"between the hedges\" due to the field being surrounded by privet hedges, which have been a part of the design of the stadium since it opened in 1929.

Published by Dow Jones & Company (a News Corp company), it formed part of the business publication franchise which included The Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal Asia, and The Wall Street Journal Online (WSJ.com).  The final print edition of the newspaper was published on 29 September 2017. Founded in 1983, The Wall Street Journal Europe was printed in nine locations throughout the region \u2013 Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the U.K. and Israel.  The paper was distributed in more than 60 countries with almost 80% of its subscribers European citizens. The Wall Street Journal Europe drew on the Dow Jones network of more than 1,900 editors and reporters worldwide, including more than 400 in Europe alone, operating from 30 news bureaus across the EMEA region. Its website, offered news and analysis, opinion, market data and multimedia features tailored for a European audience by a London-based editorial team.  Blogs include New Europe  covering Eastern and Central Europe; Iain Martin's blog on U.K. Politics The Source; and Real Time Brussels, offering analysis on events through the European business day. Content was also available via mobile devices, including a Europe edition of the WSJ.com Blackberry Reader; and a mobile-optimized website which provided continually updated news, information and analysis from Europe.WSJ.com, via any web-enabled mobile device or smartphone. Growth figures for circulation of The Wall Street Journal Europe may not be directly comparable to that of other newspapers beginning January 2008 due to the Journal's contract with Executive Learning Partnership (ELP) of the Netherlands.  This agreement involved ELP's purchasing copies of the newspaper at between 1\u00a2 and 5\u00a2 cents a copy, well below normal market price.  These copies, given at no cost to students, represented 41% of The Wall Street Journal Europe circulation by 2010.  Since ELP received payments from the Journal through intermediary companies, some journalists and a whistleblower then employed by the Journal alleged that the newspaper was secretly boosting circulation figures by buying its own papers.  This could have had a positive impact on the newspaper's advertising revenues.  The contract also committed the Journal to publishing articles that reportedly promoted ELP's activities.  While maintaining that the arrangement was legitimate and appropriate, the European managing director of the Journal's parent Dow Jones & Company, Andrew Langhoff, resigned in October 2011.  Les Hinton, who was chief executive officer of Dow Jones & Company  and who was reportedly advised of the arrangement with ELP, resigned July 2011 in conjunction with the unrelated News International phone hacking scandal."

The station consists of two separate sections, one for each line, at the same level and 150 metres apart. The north\u2013south platforms, which opened in 1978, were originally planned as a separate station, but the TTC decided to join to the existing 1966 east\u2013west station with a pedestrian tunnel containing a pair of long moving walkways. The cost of the moving walkways themselves became an issue when they became due for refurbishment or replacement, and they were shut down and ultimately removed in 2004, leaving the corridor as a simple underground walkway. The former location of the moving walkways remains visible because the tiles used to cover their removal are noticeably different. Warnings to hold the handrails are still embossed on the walls where the ends of the moving walkways were once located. An underground loop for the 510 Spadina streetcar was added in 1997 near the east end of the east\u2013west platforms. The streetcar platform adds Postmodern finishes to the station's mix of styles. These range from the basic Modernist tiles of the Bloor\u2013Danforth line platform, to the more intricate round tiles and backlit signage of the Yonge\u2013University line platform.

The Foothill Freeway name is a reference to Foothill Boulevard and the San Gabriel Mountains, both of which the freeway runs parallel to for most of its length. The freeway follows the foothills of these mountains, connecting the northeastern suburbs of Los Angeles with the Inland Empire. Historically, the Foothill Freeway spanned multiple numerical designations. Additionally, the I-210 designation has changed routings, previously including a portion of what is now the Orange Freeway (SR\u00a057). East of Pasadena, the Foothill Freeway parallels, and in some parts replaced, the route of former U.S. Route\u00a066. The portion between I-5 and SR\u00a0259 in San Bernardino was up to Interstate Highway standards by 2007, but the eastern segment remains signed as a state route because the portion between SR\u00a0259 and I-10 does not meet those standards.

The tree cathedral was planned by Edmond Blyth in the 1930s as an act of \"Faith, hope and reconciliation\" in response to his memories of World War I. As a cadet at Sandhurst in 1916 Blyth had made close friends called Arthur Bailey, John Bennett and Francis Holland who were all killed prior to the end of the war. In 1930 he paid a visit to Liverpool Cathedral, which was then under construction. Blyth wrote: \"As we drove south through the Cotswold hills on our way home... I saw the evening sun light up a coppice of trees on the side of a hill. It occurred to me then that here was something more beautiful still and the idea formed of building a cathedral with trees.\" Work began in 1932 and continued in stages. The site became overgrown during World War II, but development recommenced after the end of the war. The first religious service at the site was held in 1953, and services continue to this day. In 1960 the Tree Cathedral was accepted as a gift by the National Trust. The independent Whipsnade Tree Cathedral Fund is responsible for the religious use of the site. Services have been conducted by many different denominations. It is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Its construction is marked with a large copper cap that has oxidized brown.

The new arena opened in February 1973 and has an official capacity of 14,644 spectators. The elevation at street level is approximately  above sea level. The McKale Center was named in honor of J.F. \"Pop\" McKale, a major athletic figure at U of A from 1914 to 1957.  At one time, he was head coach of all of the school's athletic teams.  He was head basketball coach from 1914 to 1921, where he achieved a  record. He led the football team from 1914 to 1930, with an  record. It was McKale's first team that resulted in Arizona's teams being nicknamed \"Wildcats.\"  In 1914, Arizona's name meant very little in the college football world.  Although they lost to Occidental College in Los Angeles  a reporter for the Los Angeles Times was so impressed with Arizona's effort that he wrote, \"The Arizona men showed the fight of wild cats ...\"  Soon afterward, Arizona's student-athletes were nicknamed the Wildcats. Following a win over rival Arizona State on February 26, 2000, the university athletic department honored longtime head coach Lute Olson with a ceremony to name the McKale Center playing surface \"Lute Olson Court.\" Less than a year later, during a memorial service in January 2001 for Olson's late wife, Bobbi, it was renamed, \"Lute and Bobbi Olson Court\" in recognition of the couple's impact on the university and the city of Tucson. In 2002, the Eddie Lynch Athletics Pavilion, a state-of-the-art medical and strength/conditioning facility for Wildcat student athletes, was completed and opened. The pavilion (which cost $14 million) was a  addition to the north end of McKale Center. The upper level has a  museum-like display area, open to the public, showcasing the history of Arizona Wildcat athletics. In terms of capacity, McKale Center is the second-largest arena in the Pac-12 conference; Utah's Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City is first, but Arizona averages greater attendance.  Arizona has the current longest streak of leading its conference in attendance in conference history, going on 34 seasons & second in the country currently behind Kentucky at 40. The University's spring and winter commencement ceremonies were held at McKale Center from 1973 until 2012; the 2013 ceremonies returned to Arizona Stadium after an absence of thirty years."

It is home to the Louisiana State University Tigers and Lady Tigers basketball teams, the LSU Tigers women's gymnastics team and the LSU Tigers women's volleyball team.  It was originally known as the LSU Assembly Center, but was renamed in honor of Pete Maravich, a Tiger basketball legend, shortly after his death in 1988. Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer signed an act to rename the building in Maravich's honor (under Louisiana law, no LSU or state owned building may be named after a living person). Maravich never played in the arena as a collegian but played in it as a member of the Atlanta Hawks in a preseason game. But his exploits while at LSU led the University to build a larger home for the basketball team, which languished for decades in the shadow of the school's football program. The Maravich Center is known to locals as \"The PMAC\" or \"Pete's Palace\", or by its more nationally known nickname, \"The Deaf Dome\", coined by Dick Vitale. The Maravich Center's neighbor, Tiger Stadium is known as \"Death Valley\". The slightly oval building is located directly to the north of Tiger Stadium, and its bright-white roof can be seen in many telecasts of that stadium.  The arena concourse is divided into four quadrants: Pete Maravich Pass, The Walk of Champions, Heroes Hall and Midway of Memories. The quadrants highlight former LSU Tiger athletes, individual and team awards and memorabilia pertaining to the history of LSU basketball, gymnastics and volleyball. There are 11,230 permanent seats in the arena. 6,931 upper level seats, 4,299 lower level seats and 2,000 seats on retractable risers. The \"L\" Club meeting room and Tiger Athletic Foundation offices are also located in the arena. Prior to building the Assembly Center, LSU played its games at John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum (aka, the \"Cow Palace\"), located on the southeast corner of the campus."

        "content": "The Schuylkill Expressway , locally known as \"the Schuylkill\", is a two to eight lane freeway through southwestern Montgomery County and the city of Philadelphia, and the easternmost segment of Interstate 76 (I-76) in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It extends from the Valley Forge exit of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in King of Prussia, paralleling its namesake Schuylkill River for most of the route, southeast to the Walt Whitman Bridge over the Delaware River in South Philadelphia. It serves as the primary corridor into Philadelphia from points west. Maintenance and planning are administered through Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) District 6, with the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) maintaining the approach to the Walt Whitman Bridge. Constructed over a period of ten years from 1949 to 1959, a large portion of the expressway predates the 1956 introduction of Interstate Highway System; many of these portions were not built to contemporary standards. The rugged terrain, limited riverfront space covered by the route and narrow spans of bridges passing over the highway have largely stymied later attempts to upgrade or widen the highway. With the road being highly over capacity, it has become notorious for its chronic congestion. An average of 163,000 vehicles use the road daily in Philadelphia County, and an average of 109,000 use the highway in Montgomery County, making it the busiest road in Pennsylvania. Its narrow lane and left shoulder configuration, left lane entrances and exits (nicknamed \"merge or die\"), common construction activity and generally congested conditions have led to many accidents, critical injuries and fatalities, leading to the highway's humorous nickname of the \"Surekill Expressway\" or in further embellishment, the \"Surekill Distressway\" or the \u201cSurekill Crawlway\"."

In the US state of Michigan, it was a north\u2013south state trunkline highway that entered the state south of Kinderhook and ended south of Grayling. Its route consisted of a freeway concurrency with Interstate\u00a069 (I-69) from the state line north to the Lansing area before it followed its own freeway facility northward to St. Johns. From there north to Ithaca, US\u00a027 was an expressway before continuing as a freeway to a terminus south of Grayling. Created with the rest of the US Highway System on November 11, 1926, US\u00a027 replaced a pair of state highways between the state line and the Cheboygan area. For a time, US\u00a027 even extended from Cheboygan to St. Ignace over the Mackinac Bridge. The highway was converted into a series of freeways starting in the late 1950s. The northernmost section between Grayling and Mackinaw City, bypassing Cheboygan, became part of I-75, and US\u00a027 was truncated to Grayling. Starting in the 1960s, the southern sections were included in I-69. The last section of Interstate in Michigan was completed in 1992 when I-69/US\u00a027 opened southwest of Lansing. In the 1990s, a bypass of St. Johns north of Lansing was built, the last freeway segment of US\u00a027 to open under that designation. On April 16, 1999, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the removal of the US\u00a027 designation from the state of Michigan; this change was put into place when the highway number was removed from signage in 2002. Former segments of US\u00a027 from its pre-freeway configuration are still state highways in the form of M-27 between Indian River and Cheboygan or the various business routes in the state that previously bore Business US\u00a027 (Bus. US\u00a027) designations."

It was formed on 10 February 1931. Motto of this company was\u2013 Jivatang Jyotiretu Chhayam (Light infusing shadows with life). Sircar preferred to function roughly analogous to what in USA was known as an executive producer. He built a processing laboratory... and got around him a devoted band of people.... Having decided on or approved a story or a subject for a film and the team to make it [Sircar] ensured that adequate funds were provided... but refrained from interfering with its execution. He made New Theatres a symbol of Bengali cinema's artistic good taste and technical excellence. Dena Paona, a Bengali talkie, was produced by New Theatres and released in 1931. It was directed by Premankur Atarthi, with music composed by Raichand Boral. According to Kironmoy Raha, \"New Theatres made its reputation secure with Chandidas directed by Debaki Bose in 1932,\" after the studio had produced five talkies. In 1935, P.C. Barua directed and acted in Devdas, based on Saratchandra Chatterjee's novel Devdas, and this film became phenomenally successful in the industry. In 1935, playback singing was first used in India in the Bengali film Bhagya Chakra by Nitin Bose. The singers were K C Dey, Parul Ghosh and Suprabha Sarkar. Dhoop Chhaon, Hindi remake of this film, was the first Hindi film to use playback singing. Kanan Devi was the first popular star actress, who appeared in many films produced by New Theatres. Also there was a group of talented actors with New Theatres like K.L. Saigal, K. C. Dey, Prithviraj Kapoor, Chhabi Biswas, Bikash Roy, Pahari Sanyal, Basanta Choudhury.

The original label of the instrument was \"Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis faciebat Anno 1716\". The Booth Stradivarius has a two-piece back and has a body length of 35.4\u00a0cm. The Booth receives its name after a former owner, Madame Wilhelm von Booth who purchased the instrument in 1855 for her son Otto van Booth to be played in a Stradivari quartet. Otto van Booth sold the instrument in 1889 to George Hart, an instrument dealer in London, and the instrument has since been used in concerts. In 1930, Booth was sold at an auction by the American Art Association, New York to Rudolph Wurlitzer Company and played by the renowned Ukrainian-born violinist Mischa Mischakoff from 1931 to 1961. After 1961, the instrument became a part of the Henry Hottinger Collection in New York. Cho-Ming Sin from whom the instrument received one of its sobriquets owned the instrument until 1978. For a time, the instrument was owned and played by violinist Iona Brown, who after a 1998 Tokyo performance of The Lark Ascending, returned the instrument to its case declaring: \"It was received so rapturously by the audience that I went back to my dressing room, put my violin in its case and said: 'I'm not going to do it anymore.' I felt it was best to go out on a high note.\" (The Lark Ascending ends on one of the highest notes on the violin). She never played the violin again, citing her arthritis and age. She sold the instrument in 1999. Since 1999, The Booth is owned by the Nippon Music Foundation and loaned to distinguished violinists. After Iona Brown, the German violinist Julia Fischer played the instrument from 2000 to the summer of 2004, until when she purchased a 1742-made (1750-reworked) Guadagnini. After Julia Fischer, the Japanese violinist Shunske Sato played the instrument. The Booth is currently loaned to the German violinist Arabella Steinbacher."

The Laurel\u2013Fort Meade road was built as MD 602 for military access purposes in the mid-1940s, replacing the original highway between the two locations, MD 216. MD 198 was relocated through Laurel and extended east along MD 602 to Fort Meade in the early 1960s. The first divided highway portion of the highway was part of a relocation at the Interstate 95 (I-95) interchange in the early 1970s. The divided highway was extended west to Burtonsville in the mid-1980s and through Maryland City in the late 1980s. MD 198's eastern end was extended to MD 32 in the early 1990s and then moved again for its interchange with that highway in the early 2000s. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) plans to expand the remaining two-lane portions of MD 198 to a divided highway."

The Astronomical Observatory is located in Naples, Italy, on Capodimonte hill, where the splendid panorama of the city and bay of Naples from Vesuvius to Castel Sant'Elmo passing through Sorrento and Capri can be admired. The Observatory is engaged in several relevant international projects and researches, such as Solar Orbiter and ExoMars missions, gravitational waves studies, and observational instruments development for E-ELT, the next generation huge telescope. The Astronomical Observatory is the oldest scientific institution in Naples, and plays also an important role to promote and disseminate the scientific culture and the astronomical knowledge in the society. For this purpose it houses some outreach facilities like a planetarium and a 40-cm telescope, and owns an important collection of ancient astronomical instruments exhibited in the MuSA-Museum of Astronomical Instruments, and a rare and valuable old books preserved in the Ancient library. The Astronomical Observatory of Naples was established by Joseph Bonaparte with a decree dated 29 January 1807 in the ancient monastery of San Gaudioso on the Caponapoli hill. The astronomer Giuseppe Cassella was the first director of the Neapolitan specola. When Joachim Murat was appointed king of Naples, he approved 8 March 1812 the foundation of a new Observatory on the Miradois hill, a site not far from the royal palace of Capodimonte. The astronomer Federigo Zuccari and the architect Stefano Gasse conceived a monumental building in the neoclassical style, the first to be designed in the capital of the Kingdom of Naples. On 4 November 1812 the foundation stone of the new observatory was laid with a solemn ceremony presided over by Interior Minister Giuseppe Zurlo. Defined by the astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach \"The Vesuvius of Astronomy erupting gold\", the new observatory was equipped with a most advanced collection of new telescopes, like the Fraunhofer equatorial telescope with an objective of 17.5\u00a0cm, the biggest one ever made until that time, and two repeating circle realised by the Reichenbach & Utzschneider Company in Munich. In 1812 Zuccari established also an astronomical library in the san Gaudioso observatory. In four years the collection grew from 195 to 620 books. Zuccari acquired some of these books from the Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode, the secretary of Neapolitan embassy in Vienna Severo Gargani, and the Paris booksellers of the King of the Two Sicilies, Borel and Pichard. In the middle of 1815, Ferdinand I of Bourbon was back to being the king of Naples and he called in the capital the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi to supervise the conclusion of building works with the help of , the architect of Basilica of San francesco di Paola. The new observatory was completed in the autumn of 1819. The astronomer Carlo Brioschi made the first observation from the Observatory est dome in the night of 17 December 1819 observing the star \u03b1 Cassiopeia."

It was home to Manchester City F.C. and their predecessors from its construction in 1887 until 1923, when the club moved to Maine Road. It was named after Hyde Road, a road which begins at the east end of Ardwick Green South in Ardwick and runs east towards Hyde. At the boundary between Gorton and Denton it continues as Manchester Road. Before its use as a football ground, the site was an area of waste ground, and in its early days the ground had only rudimentary facilities. The first stand was built in 1888, but the ground had no changing facilities until 1896; players had to change in a nearby public house, the Hyde Road Hotel. By 1904 the ground had developed into a 40,000-capacity venue, hosting an FA Cup semi-final between Newcastle United and The Wednesday the following year. The stands and terraces were arranged in a haphazard manner due to space constraints, and by 1920 the club had outgrown the cramped venue. A decision to seek an alternative venue was hastened in November 1920, when the Main Stand was destroyed by fire. Manchester City moved to the 80,000-capacity Maine Road in 1923, and Hyde Road was demolished shortly afterward. One structure from the ground is still in use in the 21st century, a section of roofing which was sold for use at The Shay, a stadium in Halifax."

        "content": "StarMedia (stylized as starMedia) is a leading  Latin Internet brand, co-founded in August 1996 by Fernando Espuelas and Jack Chen as the first pan-regional Internet portal for Spanish and Portuguese speaking audiences.  During the dot.com boom of the 1990s, StarMedia raised the first dollar of venture capital for a Latin Internet company, and then did the first IPO in the sector, while becoming one of the top 10 biggest sites on the Internet, measured by audience, and the only one not in English. Under Espuelas' leadership, StarMedia launched a massive marketing effort to attract the very first Internet users, advertisers and e-commerce companies across the Latin world.  Called the \"Espuelas Effect\" by leading Brazilian news weekly Exame, StarMedia was the catalyst for the Internet industry throughout Latin America.  While Espuelas was CEO, Starmedia was the leading Latin portal,  serving over 25 million Spanish and Portuguese speakers every month across the Latin world. In total, StarMedia raised over $500 million in a series of private and public offerings, reaching a market capitalization of over $3.8 billion at its peak.  According to the Harvard Business School Case StarMedia: Launching a Latin American Revolution, by 1999 StarMedia was the Latin American market leader.  StarMedia is now owned by France Telecom subsidiary Orange, serving \"more than 24 million\" Hispanic Internet users per month, according to company statements in 2008. In 1996, Espuelas envisioned the portal that would \u201cunite\u201d Latin America: Starmedia. \"With the Internet, we're talking about a fundamental shift in the power structure from the institution to the individual,\" Espuelas said. After a frustrating year and a half of approaching venture capitalists to invest in his vision, only to have them uniformly refuse, many avowing that Latins \"did not like technology\" and would never use the Internet, the company went on to raise $2.5 million in 1997. It was the first venture capital ever invested in a Latin Internet company. Over the next 4 years, the company raised over $500 million in investments, including capital from Chase Manhattan Bank, GE Capital, eBay, the Hearst Corporation, Intel Capital, NBC and David Rockefeller. According to the New York City Investment Fund, \"[Espuelas]...spoke about the impact, similar to that of economic integration on European nations, that his business would have unifying Latin American people separated by national borders. A board member interrupted him. It was David Rockefeller, retired head of Chase Manhattan, brother of Nelson, and a longtime pillar-the pillar-of corporate involvement in New York City life. Rockefeller wanted to hear more. He invited Espuelas to his office.\" \"It was the most exciting thing in my life,\" says the entrepreneur. He recalls how the meeting went: \"I didn't close the sale with him until I showed him a map of Latin America without any borders. He said, 'Oh, that's good.'\" Rockefeller and the Fund became investors in StarMedia, which moved its headquarters from Connecticut to the city and quickly grew to more than 700 employees worldwide. Espuelas tells this story at a reception that New York's corporate elite was throwing for Rockefeller's 86th birthday. He introduces Rockefeller as his \"shareholder, partner, and inspiration.\" \"They have managed to come up with a pretty big capital raising at the intersection of two of the most volatile investment themes in America: the Internet and Latin America,\" said Lanny Baker, an analyst of on-line media industry for Salomon Smith Barney in San Francisco.\" In 1999, the company went public on the Nasdaq, the first Latin Internet company to do so, eventually reaching a market valuation of over $3.8 billion USD at its peak. Starmedia had over 1,200 employees in 18 offices across 12 countries in the Americas and Europe. Today, Starmedia is France Telecom's single largest Internet operation in the world, according to company statements. StarMedia, acquired by France Telecom in 2002, is a free-to-web global service connecting Spanish-speakers through the Internet as well as providing consumers relevant and extensive information and services.

It also played temporary host to Treviso for their first few matches in Serie A in the 2005\u201306 season, as their ground, Stadio Omobono Tenni, was deemed unfit; and to Cittadella, when playing her first two Serie B championships in the 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons. By 2010\u20132011 season it has been used also for the home matches of the second football team of the city, San Paolo Padova, playing in Serie D. Euganeo hosted the international rugby match Italy-Australia (20\u201330) on 8 November 2008, with an attendance of about 30,000 people, likely being the most attended rugby match in Italy. On 22 November 2014, it hosted Italy's end-of-year rugby union international against South Africa who won 22\u20136. The original Stadio Euganeo had previously hosted a rugby league international between Italy and Australia on 23 January 1960. Played as part of the 1959-60 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, the Kangaroos defeated the home side 37\u201315 in front of a modest crowd of 3,500 curious fans."

Space.com was founded by former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs and Rich Zahradnik, in July 1999. At that time, Dobbs owned a sizeable share of the company, and, in an unexpected move, left CNN later that year to become Space.com's chief executive officer. The company struggled to turn a profit in its early days and when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, many felt that it would collapse. Co-founder Rich Zahradnik left his position as president less than two months after the start of the company, former astronaut Sally Ride took his place but then stepped down in September 2000. As it expanded, it acquired other web sites such as Starport.com and Explorezone.com. It also acquired Sienna Software (the company which produced the Starry Night software) and Space News. Despite some growth, Space.com was never able to achieve what Dobbs had hoped for and in 2001, he returned to CNN.

        "content": "The Morupule Colliery is a coal mine located in Palapye, Botswana, and owned and operated by Debswana, a partnership between the government of Botswana and De Beers. Founded in 1973 to supply the Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd copper and nickel mine, operations have expanded considerably since then to supply regional power plants and industries, especially the nearby Morupule Power Station. A small wash plant, with a production capability of 120 tonnes per hour, was commissioned in January 2008 to supply a higher quality coal to local and regional consumers. This project was supported by the Botswana government as a means of stimulating the local economy, producing a less polluting form of coal than the run-of-mine coal, and to provide an alternative to the unsustainable use of wood for cooking and heating. A major expansion to the colliery is planned for 2010 and 2011. The primary purpose of the expansion is to supply coal to the adjacent Botswana Power Corporation B phase 1 power station (600 MW) that is under construction in 2010 and 2011. The power station is required to allow Botswana to become self-sufficient in power generation (in 2010, around 84% of the country's power needs were imported, mostly from Eskom in South Africa, and Eskom has indicated a phased reduction in power supply starting in 2008). The colliery expansion will see production levels increase from just under 1 million tonnes per annum to 2.8 million tons per annum. The project began with feasibility studies and designs in 2007, construction on site began in September 2010, and first coal from the expanded mine and plant is expected in November 2011. The project budget is some P1.47 billion. The colliery currently employs around 320 people (mostly drawn from the nearby town of Palapye) and after the expansion will provide permanent employment to around 480 people. The expanded mine consists of increasing the number of continuous miner sections from two to four, constructing a new crushing and screening plant to replace the existing plant, and upgrading or constructing new offices and workshops. New houses will be constructed to house the expanded workforce. A connecting pipeline has been constructed to the North-South Carrier water pipeline some 15\u00a0km away near Palapye in order to supply surface water to the mine. While any coal mine has a negative environmental impact, and the coal burnt in a power station results in carbon dioxide emissions, the colliery has taken steps to make the negative environmental impact as low as possible: the colliery received ISO 14001 certification in 2010, and activities are controlled using a formal Environmental Management System. All required environmental permitting is in place and EIAs are publicly accessible on the Expansion Project website*. Use of water in a water scarce country is reduced by performing dry screening in the plant, storm water is captured and re-used, and replenishable surface water from the North-South carrier is used. Care was taken during design to construct a plant with a small footprint and the plant will be placed on previously disturbed ground. Energy saving initiatives (energy efficient motors, lighting and solar water heating etc.) have been incorporated into the design. The mine does not produce any discards, does not deposit fines on a slimes dam (these are dispatched to BPC to be burnt in the power station) and does not discharge any effluent water into the environment. While the colliery has mining rights over an area of some 170 square kilometers, mining is conducted below surface, and current land-use owners' rights to farm and graze cattle on tribal land have not been affected. No forced relocation of people living within the mining area has occurred. The colliery operates a small game park of some 1700 hectares in the area around the mine village, and this is used for conservation and to provide people of the area with recreation and environmental education. The coalfield is composed of four main seams, only one of which, the No. 1 Seam, is currently being mined, below surface, using bord and pillar mining methods and continuous miners. No pillar extraction occurs, and the mine design is conservative to prevent surface subsidence. The No. 1 Seam has an average height of 8.5 meters (28\u00a0ft), an average CV of around 23.5 MJ/kg (air-dry) and is located at an average depth of 80 meters (260\u00a0ft) below surface. Production over a recent 7-year stretch averaged 877,000 tonnes per year. Overall coalfield resources within the mining lease area estimated at 5 billion tonnes of coal. In 2021, it was announced that the mine will develop a new open cast coal mine with Basil Read to increase output by 35%."

Known for much of their length as Philadelphia Road, there are five disjoint mainline sections of the highway totaling  that parallel U.S.\u00a0Route\u00a040 (US\u00a040) in Baltimore, Harford, and Cecil counties in northeastern Maryland. The longest section of MD\u00a07 begins at US\u00a040 just east of the city of Baltimore in Rosedale and extends through eastern Baltimore County and southern Harford County to US\u00a040 in Aberdeen. The next segment of the state highway is a C-shaped route through Havre de Grace on the west bank of the Susquehanna River. The third mainline section of MD\u00a07 begins in Perryville on the east bank of the Susquehanna River and ends at US\u00a040 a short distance west of the start of the fourth section, which passes through Charlestown and North East before ending at US\u00a040, just west of Elkton. The fifth segment of the highway begins at South Street and passes through the eastern part of Elkton before reconnecting with US\u00a040 east of Elkton and west of the Delaware state line. MD\u00a07 is the old alignment of US\u00a040 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid out early in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between Baltimore and Philadelphia (going further north to New York City and into New England to Boston) and between the northern and southern of the original Thirteen Colonies on the East Coast. The highway in Baltimore and Harford counties became a turnpike, constructed and operated  by a private stockholder company in the early 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission (established 1908 - now the Maryland State Highway Administration  within the Maryland Department of Transportation since the early 1970s) marked portions of what became known as the Philadelphia Road, close to Baltimore and between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated as US\u00a040 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the old Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway (named for the foreign  military volunteer of a Polish cavalry officer  Casimir Pulaski (1745-1779), who fought in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), which was constructed during the \"Great Depression\" years between 1935 and 1941. Old sections of US\u00a040 became segments of MD\u00a07 between 1938 and 1941 as portions of the new four-lane divided highway were opened from Baltimore to Elkton."

The reservoir covers an area of 25 hectares and has a capacity of 559 million gallons (2.11x109 litres) of water, the dam wall has a width of approximately 380 feet (349 m) with a height of 100 feet (30 m) 'Agden' means 'Valley of the Oak Trees' The reservoir is one of four built in the second half of the 19th century to satisfy the developing steel industry of Sheffield, collecting water from the moorlands around the village of Low Bradfield, west of Sheffield. The other three being Damflask, Dale Dike and Strines reservoirs. Agden was completed in 1869 and is fed by Hobson Moss Dike and Emlin Dike which flow off the Broomhead and Bradfield moors respectively. The reservoir is surrounded mainly by coniferous woodland, however, Sheffield City Council who own much of the woodland have started a policy of replanting and thinning to encourage broadleaved varieties of trees which give a better habitat for wildlife and also look more attractive. The reservoir is ringed by a popular walk which starts in the village of Low Bradfield and takes in Agden Bog which is a protected wetland area managed by the Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs past the eastern end of the dam. The former Keeper's cottage is at the western side of the dam wall, now a private home, and Agden Lodge built in 1870 for Samuel Fox of Stocksbridge, remains as a private residence. There are also remnants of old farm dwellings around the reservoir - the Water Authorities allegedly had a policy of buying any available property around their reservoirs, solely for demolition, claiming they were a source of possible water contamination. Many fine old buildings were lost to this rationale, including Frost House early-1950s, Rocher Head Farm early-1960s and the 17thC Agden House on the western side, demolished 1972, although it's barn survives.

In the mid 1970s, Bogart's opened in the space after an extensive remodeling as a 250-seat club and restaurant, expanded around 1980 and then further expanded to 1,500 seats in 1993. In 1997, Nederlander Concerts assumed management of Bogart's. SFX (now Live Nation) bought many of Nederlander's concert operations in 1999. Prior to its 1980 expansion, Bogarts hosted themed-party nights, such as a Casablanca club theme when the venue opened. It hosted a wide variety of comedians, ranging from Billy Crystal to Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, national recording artists and bands that gained fame through their appearances at Bogart's, such as Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers. In its early years, Bogart's was the proving ground for many up-coming metal bands. The intimate setting offered an up-close experience, often allowing the crowd to flow onto the stage with performers such as Testament, Slayer, Death, Dark Angel, Overkill, W.A.S.P. and others. While metal bands appeared frequently, Bogart's offered performances of several music styles each week. The venue remains under management of Live Nation and has two levels: a pit, and a balcony which is open for larger events."

The ground was donated to the club by Frank Adams, a former Wanderers player who had bought the freehold on the ground from Lord Carrington in 1945. The club's present ground, Adams Park, was named in honour of Frank Adams. The most famous feature of the ground was the 11-foot slope across the pitch, running downhill from the main seated stand. The record attendance was 15,850 for an FA Amateur Cup Fourth Round tie on Saturday 25 February 1950, when Wycombe Wanderers beat St Albans City 4\u20131. It remains to this day the highest attendance for a Wycombe Wanderers home fixture. The ground comprised a wooden seated main stand (holding around 1,000 people) along the top (south) side of the ground, a covered stand opposite this with shallow terracing (affectionately known as the \"Cowshed\"), and open terraces with crowd barriers at each end. Arguably the most memorable match to be played at Loakes Park was in the FA Cup Third Round on Saturday 4 January 1975. At the time, Middlesbrough were near the top of the old Football League First Division (now the Premier League), and Wycombe (a non-league team at this time) held them to a 0\u20130 draw. The game was watched by 12,000 people. During the final season at Loakes Park, 1989\u201390, Wycombe Wanderers were still playing in the GM Vauxhall Conference. Three years later they won promotion to the Football League. The site of Loakes Park was redeveloped, partly as extra car parking for the nearby hospital, and partly as new housing. When the club moved to its new Adams Park ground, the original gates from Loakes Park were transferred to the new stadium."

The highway extends from an intersection with  in Kahlotus north through Lind, Odessa, Clark, Keller, Republic and Curlew before becoming  (BC\u00a041) at the Canada\u2013US border in Danville. SR\u00a021 is concurrent with  (US\u00a02) in Wilbur and  in Republic and has two diamond interchanges: at  in Lind and  (I-90) south of Odessa. Between Lincoln and Ferry counties, the roadway crosses Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake on the Keller Ferry, operated fare free by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the Department of Highways (DoH) since 1930. Since 1899, at least one segment of the current highway has been in the state highway system. In 1899, the Marble Mount Road was established and later numbered  in 1905 and renamed to the Sans Poil-Loomis Road in 1907. In 1915, a branch to the Canada\u2013US border was added to the highway, but was removed in 1923. In 1937, the Primary state highways were established and State Road\u00a04 became  (PSH\u00a04), while the former Canadian branch became Secondary State Highway\u00a04A (SSH\u00a04A). Another highway, extending from Lind to Wilbur, became SSH\u00a04B. In 1964, PSH\u00a04 was split into SR\u00a020 and SR\u00a021 while SSH\u00a02A and SSH\u00a02B also became SR\u00a021. In 1983, a road between Lind and Kahlotus became part of SR\u00a021. The Keller Ferry, which travels across the Columbia River at Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to connect the two segments of SR\u00a021, was originally a private cable ferry operated in the early 1890s. In 1929, the Ferry and Lincoln counties unveiled a new eight-car cable ferry, named the Keller of Seattle, which served the two counties until 1930. The state highway department took over operations of the ferry in 1930 and replaced the vessel with various boats until a permanent ferry, the Martha S., was launched in 1948. The Martha S. would go on to serve until 2013, when it was retired and replaced with the more modern ."

The route, located in western Culberson County, is largely isolated passing through no cities or towns beyond Van Horn and intersecting no other highways between Van Horn and its northern terminus. Within Van Horn, the route has intersections with Business Interstate 10-D and Farm to Market Road 2185. The route was established early in the history of the Texas highway system originally beginning in Alpine and ending at the New Mexico state line near Carlsbad, NM. The route's length and termini have changed over the years as have the roads with which it intersect largely due to two factors. First in the early years was the development of the United States Highway system which incorporated many parts of the former length of the route and even resulted in the brief elimination of SH 54 as well as other former state highways it intersected. Later was the construction of I-10 at Van Horn that caused SH 54 to be extended to meet the Interstate and resulted ultimately in the realignment and eventual decommissioning of US 80 in western Texas and changes in the designation of the former route of US 80 through the town."

        "title": "The Birth of Venus (Cabanel)_Summary",
        "content": "The Birth of Venus  (French: Naissance de Venus) is a painting by the French artist Alexandre Cabanel. It was painted in 1863, and is now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. A second and smaller version (85 x 135.9\u00a0cm) from ca. 1864 is in Dahesh Museum of Art. A third (106 x 182.6\u00a0cm) version dates from 1875; it is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Shown to great success at the Paris Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was immediately purchased by Napoleon III for his own personal collection. That same year Cabanel was made a professor of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Cabanel's erotic imagery, cloaked in historicism, appealed to the propriety of the higher levels of society. Art historian and curator Robert Rosenblum wrote of Cabanel's The Birth of Venus that \"This Venus hovers somewhere between an ancient deity and a modern dream\"; he described \"the ambiguity of her eyes, that seem to be closed but that a close look reveals that she is awake ...  A nude who could be asleep or awake is specially formidable for a male viewer\". Cabanel was a determined opponent of the Impressionists, especially \u00c9douard Manet, although the refusal of the academic establishment to realize the importance of new ideas and sources of inspiration would eventually prove to be the undoing of the Academy. At the Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was one of a multitude of female nudes. Bathed in opalescent colors, the goddess Venus shyly looks to the viewer from beneath the crook of her elbow. Two years later, Manet presented his now renowned painting Olympia at the Salon as well. Today both hang in the Musee\u2019d\u2019 Orsay. Unlike Venus's ethereal-like palette, Manet painted Olympia with pale, placid skin tone, and darkly outlined the figure. Her only seemingly modest gesture is her placement of her hand over her leg, though it is not out of shyness- one must pay before they can see. James Rubin writes of the two works: \u201cThe Olympia is often compared to Cabanel\u2019s Birth of Venus, for the latter is a far more sexually appealing work, despite its mythological guise\u2026 It is evident Manet\u2019s demythologizing of the female nude was foremost a timely reminder of modern realities. The majority of critics attacked the painting with unmitigated disgust\u2026: \u201cWhat is this odalisque with the yellow belly, ignoble model dredged up from who knows where?\u201d [And] \u201cThe painter\u2019s attitude is of inconceivable vulgarity.\u201d Cabanel depicts personality, but in subtle ways through her relaxed posture and sleepy expression. Jenna-Marie Newberry writes of Venus: \u201cThe lightest of color used in The Birth of Venus alludes to the lightness and enlightenment of relaxation, amplifying the reclining nude\u2019s placid demeanor and virginity. The contrapposto twist of the figure with the melodramatic swoop of the arm over the face comes directly from his previous paintings \u2026 Venus herself takes over the entire front of the picture plane. Her hair has been deepened, adding more to her allure and purity.\u201d It is as if the viewer is catching a glimpse of a goddess simply basking in the nature that enfolds her. She is calm, and asks nothing with her gaze. She is a part of her surroundings and the viewer is privy to behold upon the scene. By adhering to the accepted canon of the day, Cabanel produced a quite seductive painting of a mythological beauty presented in a calculated way that was acceptable for viewers at the time of its creation. Following the Salon it was said: \u201cHis dark-eyed heroines, thinly painted, usually in muted colors and immaculately drawn, were popular on both sides of the Atlantic\u201d. Over time, Cabanel developed what would become his signature style. It was his attention to detail that made him popular in the nineteenth century. Cabanel was schooled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts under the painter Fran\u00e7ois-Edouard Picot. Following his tutelage, he entered his first Salon in 1843 and won second place in the Prix de Rome in 1845. \u201cSeveral major decorative commissions followed including the ceiling in the Cabinet des Dessins in the Louvre, and are typical of Cabanel\u2019s talent for achieving sumptuous effects.\u201d Initially famous for his mythological paintings, Cabanel also made a name for himself in Europe and abroad through his portraits.  \u201cPraised as a portraitist of women, Cabanel expressed that he was particularly adept at painting portraits of American women.\u201d A portrait by Cabanel was a desirable commodity. He was a favored portraitist of the Emperor Napoleon himself, and he also refused to travel outside France to accept a commission. This required American elite to travel to Paris to sit for him. \u201cCabanel had the ability to lend his sitters an air of gentility and urbanity, and to give them an aristocratic allure.\"  C.H Stranahan summarized the appeal of Cabanel's style shortly before his death saying: \u201c\u2026He is especially the master of every grace attractive to woman; great judiciousness in rendering what his subtle reading of the human face gives him; great power and knowledge of hands, which leads to his throwing a veil of mystery over the expression, even leaving a softening vagueness\". Upon his death in 1889, \u201cJournals and dailies paid indulgent tribute to Cabanel in obituaries.\u201d In one, he was called \u201cthe most distinguished painter of the grand style,\u201d and \u201call commented on Cabanel\u2019s liberal teaching\"."

The 45-story structure was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and completed in 1974 as the last portion of the new Federal Center. It is  tall and with the Mies designed post office and plaza stands on the site previously occupied by the Chicago Federal Building by the architect Henry Ives Cobb. It was named in honor of U.S. Congressman John C. Kluczynski, who represented Illinois's 5th congressional district from 1951 to 1975 after his death that year. This is one of three buildings by van der Rohe in the Federal Center Plaza complex: the others are the Loop Station Post Office and the Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse. The Kluczynski Building is constructed of a steel frame and contains  of space.  The exterior is sheathed in bronze-tinted glass set into bright aluminum frames.  Beneath the windows are steel spandrel panels painted flat black and windows are separated horizontally by steel mullions of projecting steel I-beams also painted black.  The two-story lobby is recessed allowing for a colonnade or pilotis to encircle the building at street level.  The interior walls and floors of the lobby are covered in granite which extends to the plaza.  The lobby contains several commemorative tablets which were removed from the previous building. The entire complex is based on a  grid pattern so that seams of the granite pavers in the plaza extend into the building lobbies and up the sides to create unity among the three structures.  The Center is similar to  Mies' earlier Toronto-Dominion Centre and was expanded in 1991 with the addition of the 28-story Metcalfe Federal Building to the south across Jackson Boulevard. In 2009, GSA undertook a major project to improve energy efficiency which included solar film on windows, LED lighting upgraded HVAC and other mechanical systems. After the work, the building received a LEED Silver certification. Alexander Calder's sculpture Flamingo, a  red steel sculpture, was unveiled on the plaza October 24, 1974.  The sculpture was conserved and restored in 1998.  The plaza is also the site of a weekly farmers' market during the spring and summer seasons, open to the community. Federal agencies in the building include the Air Force Recruiting Service, the Department of State Passport Agency, Department of Labor, Internal Revenue Service, Office of Personnel Management, Consumer Product Safety Commission, General Services Administration and offices for both the U.S. senators from Illinois, Richard \"Dick\" Durbin and Tammy Duckworth. Following his election as president on November 4, 2008, Barack Obama established his administration's transitional offices in the federal building, prompting heightened security measures in the surrounding area."

Originally, most Pullmantur ships do not operate cruises for the company during the northern hemisphere winter season. Instead, they are either laid up or under charter to other cruise lines, such as the Brazil-based Viagens CVC. On 22 June 2020, due to the economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Pullmantur's owners announced they had filed for reorganization of Pullmantur under Spanish insolvency laws. Pullmantur under Administration review was hoping to restart some operations with MV Horizon, laid up in Eleusis Bay, and two Celebrity Millennium class cruise ships. By December 2020, a reorganization plan had been developed, to restart some cruises, with financial assistance from Royal Caribbean. Since mid July 2021 it was in process of liquidation."

Artists recording for the label included Al Wilson, Barbi Benton, Blue Ash, Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers, The Weapons of Peace, Brenda Patterson, Lois Fletcher, Jeanne French, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds, Ivory, Greg Kihn, The Rubinoos, Wynn Stewart, Mickey Gilley and Joey Stec. A notable LP was Hudson, the first album by the Hudson Brothers. Another notable artist is Jim Sullivan, whose second album (self titled) was released on Playboy.  Playboy also issued on LP the only full-length live concert recording by Lead Belly from a recording made in 1949, shortly before his death. Playboy Records was also home to the early 1972-1973 U.S. single releases by soon-to-be international superstars ABBA, licensed to the label by their Swedish label, Polar Music. Polar/ABBA manager Stig Anderson blamed the lack of greater U.S. success of their first single, \"People Need Love\", on the limited distribution resources of the label, as they were unable to meet the demand from retailers and radio programmers, and Polar changed distributors when ABBA won Eurovision in 1974, to Atlantic Records. The label's biggest hit was Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds' million-seller, \"Fallin' in Love\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975 (also reaching #24, R&B). Al Wilson also had a major hit for the label in 1976 when \"I've Got a Feeling\" reached #3 on the R&B chart (#29 pop). In addition to its own material, Playboy also acted as the distributor for the Beserkley Records label, which predominantly released music by power pop acts such as The Modern Lovers and The Greg Kihn Band. The label was originally independently distributed and towards the end of its life, CBS Records took over distribution. The original incarnation of the label folded in 1978, after which Elektra Records took over the distribution of Beserkley titles until that label dissolved in 1984. The label was relaunched in 2001 as a jazz imprint distributed by Concord Records. Sony Music's Legacy Recordings handles Playboy Records  catalog from the 1970s."

It was created in 1939 from a combination of three newspapers founded between 1869 and 1905, and was later acquired by the E. W. Scripps Company. Scripps traded the paper, along with The Monterey County Herald, to Knight Ridder in 1997, in exchange for the Boulder Daily Camera. The McClatchy Company took over the paper on June 27, 2006, when it acquired Knight Ridder, formerly the United States' second-largest chain of daily newspapers. The Tribune owns one weekly newspaper, The Cambrian, located in Cambria, California. A second weekly newspaper, The Sun Bulletin of Morro Bay, no longer publishes. According to McClatchy, the newspaper's daily circulation is 35,080 (2015), rising to 45,250 on Sundays (unknown date). Total readership is estimated at 90,800 on weekdays and 102,800 on Sunday (unknown date). In February 2015, the paper's publisher, Bruce Ray, announced his resignation; Fresno Bee president and publisher Tom Cullinan was named publisher for the paper. In late 2015, along with many other McClatchy newspapers, The Tribune went through a redesign, adopting a companywide design style for both print and online platforms.  Ken Riddick was named president and publisher of The Tribune in October 2017. The Tribune's longtime Executive Editor Sandra Duerr retired in December 2017. On February 13, 2020, the paper announced that its owner, The McClatchy Company, had declared bankruptcy. In an article by Kevin G. Hall, McClatchy claimed that bankruptcy was necessary in order to \"...shed costs of print legacy and speed shift to digital.\" Court filings revealed a plan that would turn over control to hedge fund management company, Chatham Asset Management. The family held company would have to give up its shares in McClatchy, which according to a press release, operates 31 newspapers from Miami to Sacramento California. No information was given about potential layoffs at that time."

During its first full year, the channel had average ratings of 0,0 minutes per day and person (Mediam\u00e4tning i Skandinavien). In February 2006, the Swedish government announced that the channel had received a license to broadcast unencrypted in the digital terrestrial network between 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The channel timeshares with ONE Television that broadcast between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Terrestrial broadcasting started in late May 2006. In February 2007, ONE Television was replaced by Kanal 9, which wanted to broadcast during other times than ONE Television did. The timeshare was altered so that Kanal 9 would broadcast from 5.40 p.m. to 5.40 a.m. on weekdays and from 2.30 p.m. to 2.30 a.m. on weekends, while The Voice TV would broadcast during the remaining time. During the channel's second full year, 2006, the ratings had increased slightly to 0,2 minutes per day and person. In 2007, it was viewed 0,3 minutes per day. In March 2008, The Voice TV received a new broadcast license running from 1 April 2008. The license stipulated that starting on 1 January 2009, The Voice TV would broadcast around the clock. This would be done using a new transmitter network that would use H.264 compression. In early September 2008 it was announced that The Voice TV would be closed down on 30 September. This was mostly because the channel would move to a new transmitter network. At the time, this network hadn't been built and few of the set-top-boxes on the market would be able to receive its broadcasts. On 8 September 2008 The Voice TV ended its transmissions in the terrestrial network. The programming consisted mainly of music videos and the channel is linked to the radio network The Voice Hiphop & RnB Sweden."

The towers are all of different heights, and differ slightly in their living accommodations. Tower B is the tallest of the three, at 22 stories. Tower A is 19 stories tall, and Tower C is 16 stories in height. Rooms in Towers A and B are the same size, roughly 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) by 11\u00a0ft (3.4\u00a0m).

Known for most of its length as Hanover Pike, the highway runs  from MD 140 in Reisterstown north to the Pennsylvania state line near Melrose, where the highway continues as Pennsylvania Route 94 (PA 94). MD 30 is a major, two-lane regional highway in western Baltimore County and northeastern Carroll County. Locally, the highway serves the towns of Manchester and Hampstead; the latter town is bypassed by the highway but served by a business route. Regionally, MD 30 connects Reisterstown and Baltimore with Hanover, Pennsylvania. MD 30 originated in the colonial era as part of a wagon road connecting the fledgling port of Baltimore with the new settlement that was to become Hanover. This highway was improved as a turnpike in the 19th century. MD 30 was constructed as a state road by the Maryland State Roads Commission in the late 1910s and early 1920s, and it became one of the original state-numbered highways in 1927. The state highway was relocated and widened near Reisterstown in the late 1930s and along the rest of its route in the early 1950s. The Hampstead Bypass was planned as early as the 1960s to ameliorate the increasing congestion along the MD 30 corridor that was only exacerbated when I-795 was completed to Reisterstown in the late 1980s. However, the construction of the bypass was continually delayed due to environmental issues and politics. The bypass was finally constructed between 2006 and 2009; the old highway through Hampstead became MD 30 Business. A MD 30 bypass of Manchester has also been discussed since the 1960s, but the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) has no plans to construct the new highway in the foreseeable future."

U.S. and Interstate Highways are classified as state routes in New York; however, a letter (\"U\" or \"I\", respectively) is suffixed to the number of the route. As a result, there is apparent duplication between U.S. Routes, Interstate Highways and state routes. The New York state highway system is supplemented by the state's county route system, which comprises a series of highways numbered and maintained by the individual county highway departments. While neighboring New Jersey employs a statewide numbering system, no such system exists in New York. Instead, each county numbers its highways independently of other counties. As a result, county routes typically change numbers when they cross county lines. In some cases, the state highway and county highway systems overlap. More specifically, some portions of U.S. Routes and state routes in New York are signed as U.S. Routes or state routes but are maintained by the county that the route lies within. These county-maintained segments also carry a county route designation that may or may not be posted alongside the U.S. or state designation, depending on the signing practices of the county. Some state routes, such as New York State Route\u00a0148 in Niagara County, are entirely county-maintained."

The tunnel was constructed during 1845\u201346 by the contractors Ross and Mitchell, to a design by John Miller, who was the Engineer to the North British Railway. Upon completion, the tunnel was inspected by the Inspector-General of Railways, Major-General Charles Pasley, on behalf of the Board of Trade. The tunnel consisted of a single bore,  long, containing two running lines. During its 134-year existence, the tunnel was the location of two incidents investigated by HM Railway Inspectorate. The first was in 1949, when a serious fire destroyed two carriages of a south-bound express from Edinburgh. Seven passengers were injured, but there were no deaths. The second incident occurred on 17 March 1979 when, during improvement works, a length of the tunnel collapsed. Two workmen were killed, and 13 others managed to escape. Later it was determined that the ground was not stable enough to excavate and rebuild the tunnel, so it was sealed up and a new alignment was made for the railway, in a cutting to the west of the hill. The tunnel was also affected by the August 1948 floods. The damage caused by these floods led to the abandonment of much of the railway network in the south east of Scotland."

Geilston Garden was developed more than two hundred years ago with a date given for its development being 1797, combining several features (traditional walled garden, kitchen garden, wooded area). The walled garden has a dominating 100-foot Wellingtonia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in the centre of the lawn. The Geilston burn wends its way through the north of the estate towards the River Clyde in Cardross. The origins of the garden were most likely a result of the 1770 Montgomery Act, which saw the land around the house enclosed and planting undertaken. Geilston was opened to the public with the death of the last resident, Margaret Bell, who was a friend of Elizabeth Hendry, the owner of Geilston who bequeathed the house to the National trust for Scotland and gave her friend life rent of the house. The Hendrys moved into Geilston as tenants but the family bought the house from the Geils in 1922. The garden as it appears today was mostly laid out by Elizabeth Hendry and Margaret Bell. A cannon within the garden is said to have been a trophy from the Battle of Corunna brought to the Garden by Major General Geils, a previous owner of Geilston. The kitchen garden is the most labour-intensive area. It springs to life in April with the first sowings of carrots, parsnips and beetroot closely followed by transplanted brassicas. Visitors can buy in-season produce from a small stand at the garden's entrance. The walled garden is the focus of spring colour with azaleas, heathers and unusual shrubs such as Cornus kousa 'Satomi'. Summer colour is provided by the spectacularly vigorous species in the long herbaceous border \u2013 Thalictrum, Filipendula, Eupatorium, Helenium, Phlox and Sidalcea dominate the display. The garden is open from April to October daily. The adjacent Geilston House is not open to the public."

Wickersham was the second vessel, after the , in the Alaska Marine Highway fleet to not have been constructed specifically for AMHS, but was rather acquired for from the Stena Line, where it was known as the Stena Britannica and served the Kiel, Germany\u2013Gothenburg, Sweden route. Constructed just one year prior to its purchase by AMHS in April 1968, her arrival and status as an \"oceangoing\" vessel allowed AMHS to expand the southern terminus of its route system south to Washington and the Port of Seattle. Due to the Passenger Services Act and laws of cabotage, however, the Wickersham could only undergo its Washington-Alaska voyages with an intermediate stop in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Further complicating her service was her complicated bow unloading system which was only compatible with AMHS ports in Haines, Juneau, Ketchikan, and Sitka, in addition to the ports of Seattle and Prince Rupert. Her large size and draft which served her well in the turbulent waters of Dixon Entrance and other exposed portions of the Alaska-Washington voyage, were too great to slip through passages of water such as Peril Strait en route to Sitka, which forced her to approach Sitka from the outer coast of Baranof Island and through the Pacific Ocean. With the debut of the , the marine highway's new flagship vessel, in 1974, the Wickersham was sold to the Finland-based Rederi Ab Sally as the Viking 6, where she sailed from Stockholm to Helsinki under the Viking Line brand."

The CEO was Jim Stewart, previously of the parent bank's First USA division. The bank began operations on June 24, 1999, with the marketing slogan \"If your bank could start over, this is what it would be.\" An aggressive online marketing campaign was carried out to promote the bank, which also received wide coverage in mainstream financial press. The venture also benefited from its parent's existing marketing agreements with major web portals such as America Online, MSN, and Excite. A marketing agreement was also entered into with then-major search engine/portal Lycos. An additional incentive was the promise of a $100 reward to the first 10,000 customers. There was also an introductory 10% interest for a short period when opening a new checking account. Despite being owned by Bank One, an existing brick and mortar banking institution based in Chicago, Wingspan was branded wholly separately and with minimal acknowledgment of the relationship. As a result, Wingspan's online-only operation effectively competed with Bank One's own online presence, particularly as the online bank's lack of physical presence allowed it to provide better fees and rates for customers. The bank provided most traditional financial services from interest-bearing checking accounts to credit cards, Individual Retirement Accounts and HELOCs. It also provided bill pay, with on-time payment guarantee, although the payment was physically done via the bank mailing a check to the payee in most cases. The lack of physical presence was ultimately a negative for the bank. While customers were able to use Bank One ATMs for free, they could not use any physical bank branches. Non-electronic deposits had to be made via postal mail. The bank refunded up to $5 in ATM fees per month for customers not living in Bank One's footprint. By September 2001, Bank One discontinued the Wingspan brand and rolled the online bank's customers into Bank One's existing online service as regular account holders. The parent company cited the online bank's inability to attract a sufficient number of customers as the reason for its closure. The reintegration of Bank One's online venture followed a similar action by Citibank with its Citi/fi brand, and other online banks such as Telebank merged with or entered into service agreements with physical banks. CEO Jim Stewart left Wingspan in late 1999 to form Juniper Financial."

The football field had a conventional north-south orientation, at an approximate elevation of  above sea level.

In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN acquired FiveThirtyEight, hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ESPN.com; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014. Since then, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property ABC News (also under parent The Walt Disney Company). During the presidential primaries and general election of 2008 the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in sabermetrics to \"balance out the polls with comparative demographic data\". Silver weighted \"each poll based on the pollster's historical track record, sample size, and recentness of the poll\". Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles\u2014typically creating or analyzing statistical information\u2014on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the Senate; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for health care reform, global warming legislation and LGBT rights; elections around the world; marijuana legalization; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the 2012 presidential election in which FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. FiveThirtyEight has won numerous awards. These include Bloggie Awards for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as Webbies for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013.

It is owned and maintained by Andreas Heldal-Lund, who has stated that he supports the rights of all people to practice Scientology or any religion. Operation Clambake has referred to the Church of Scientology as \"a vicious and dangerous cult that masquerades as a religion\". The website includes texts of petitions, news articles, expos\u00e9s, and primary source documents. The site has been ranked as high as the second spot in Google searches for the term \"Scientology\". The term for the organization refers both to a traditional clam bake, as well as the notion from L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology: A History of Man that humans follow a \"genetic line\" which includes clams, and that the psychological problems afflicting humans are impacted by past experiences. The domain name xenu.net is a reference to the character Xenu from secretive \"OT III\" Scientology documents. In 1996, the site was one of the first locations on the internet to host secret Scientology documents pertaining to Xenu and OT III. Shortly thereafter, the Church of Scientology attempted to get this material removed from Operation Clambake and other internet sites, through letters written by counsel, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After receiving a DMCA takedown notice, Google removed many Xenu.net pages from its indexes, which decreased the site's page rank in searches for \"Scientology\". This inspired Google to contribute to the Chilling Effects archive, informing others about material missing from Google indexes due to DMCA takedown notices and other legal threats. Operation Clambake has been consulted by news media organizations and other groups for information on Scientology and related organizations. Dateline NBC cited the organization in a 1998 investigative journalism piece, as have other publications including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Associated Press. During the Spring 2002 semester, Xenu.net was included as required reading in a New York University course on \"Copyright and Censorship\", and in 2003 webmaster Andreas Heldal-Lund received the 2003 Leipzig Human Rights Award by the European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the US, an organization opposed to the Church of Scientology."

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made the sinking possibly one of the deadliest for a single ship up to that time. It remains to this day the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship. The disaster drew much public attention, provided foundational material for the disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic works. RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of threes operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, who was the chief naval architect of the shipyard at that time, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants, and opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's operational use. The Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors. The ship was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each of which were capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats; the Titanic carried only 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while the ship was sinking. Together, the 20 lifeboats were capable of holding 1,178 people\u2014which was only about half the number of passengers on board, and only one-third of the number of passengers that the ship could have carried at full capacity (this was consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). In addition, when the ship sank, many of the lifeboats that had been lowered were only about half full. Titanic had departed from Southampton on 10 April 1912, then stopped at Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, before heading west towards New York. On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about  south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40\u00a0pm ship's time. The collision caused the hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard (right) side and laid five of her sixteen watertight compartments open to the sea; she had been designed to survive the flooding of up to four compartments. Some passengers and crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a \"women and children first\" protocol for loading lifeboats. In 2022, Claes-G\u00f5ran Wetterholm, an author and expert on the Titanic, said it was \"not true\" that women and children survived thanks to the gallantry of men. Of the last survivors escaping on the final lifeboats leaving the starboard side of the ship, he said, the majority were men. At 2:20\u00a0am, the ship broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after Titanic sank, the Cunard liner  arrived on the scene, and took on board an estimated 710 survivors. The disaster was met with worldwide shock and outrage, both at the huge loss of life and at the regulatory and procedural failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of the most important results of the inquiries was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. In addition, there was an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications that had increased the number of fatalities, and as a result, several new wireless regulations were put in place around the world. The wreck of Titanic was discovered in 1985 by a Franco-American expedition sponsored by the United States Navy. The ship was split in two and is gradually disintegrating at a depth of . Thousands of artefacts have been recovered and displayed at museums around the world. Titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history, depicted in numerous works of popular culture, including books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials. Titanic is the second-largest ocean liner wreck in the world, only being surpassed by her sister ship ; however, she is the largest sunk while in service as a liner, as Britannic was in use as a hospital ship at the time of her sinking. The final survivor of the sinking, Millvina Dean, aged two months at the time, died in 2009 at the age of 97; there are no survivors of the Titanic that are still alive today."

The site was launched by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins in 2003 as a multilingual effort aiming to cover all the globe's destinations. In 2006, Internet Brands bought the trademark and servers and later introduced advertising to the website. This move met opposition from users, with many German and Italian editors leaving in December 2006 for a newly established wiki, Wikivoyage. In 2006, Wikitravel launched a free media repository known as Wikitravel Shared, and in 2007, it received a Webby Award for Best Travel Website. The same year, Wikitravel's founders began Wikitravel Press, a now-defunct project that published printed travel guides based on the website's content. The first print guides were released on February 1, 2008. In 2012, in response to sustained dissatisfaction with Internet Brands' commercialization and technical support, a large portion of the editing community, including the founders, left and transferred their contributions to the Wikivoyage travel guide, which was relaunched as a Wikimedia Foundation\u2013hosted project in January 2013. Since then, Wikivoyage has surpassed Wikitravel in edit count, page count, and global viewership."

Gibson owned the dog when he was previously a member of 106 Squadron. Nigger often accompanied Gibson on training flights and was a great favourite of the members of both 106 and 617 Squadrons. He was noted for his liking of beer, which he drank from his own bowl in the Officers' Mess. Nigger died on 16 May 1943, the day of the famous \"Dam Busters\" raid, when he was hit by a car.  He was buried at midnight as Gibson was leading the raid. \"Nigger\" (Morse code: -. .. --. --. . .-. ) was the codeword Gibson used to confirm the breach of the M\u00f6hne Dam. Nigger's grave is at Royal Air Force station Scampton, Lincolnshire. In July 2020 the headstone was replaced, with his name removed. The RAF said it \"did not want to give prominence to an offensive term that went against its ethos\"."

T\u00e9oz services were not universally liked as they required compulsory reservation but went little faster than the traditional services they replaced. Since December 2011 the Teoz brand has been abandoned and all SNCF long distance services have been assimilated into the Intercit\u00e9s brand, along with the overnight sleeper trains which have also lost their previous branding (Lun\u00e9a). There was an \u00c9co train, which was running once a day on the line from the Gare d'Austerlitz in Paris to Toulouse. In 2nd class, passengers could choose between reclining seats in an open carriage, or six-person couchette compartments with the couchettes folded to form benches.

These additions included videos by choreographer Marie Chouinard and filmmaker Xavier Dolan. The soundtracks for each section change according to the time and weather on the mountain. As of May 2011, photos and videos from the site are being displayed on a giant screen in an arrival hall at Montr\u00e9al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, as part of an exhibition of NFB works at the airport."

        "content": "The Prussian Homage () is an oil on canvas painting by Polish painter Jan Matejko painted between 1879 and 1882 in Krak\u00f3w (then part of Austria-Hungary). The painting depicts the \"Prussian Homage,\" a significant political event from the time of the Renaissance in Poland in which Albrecht of Hohenzollern, the Duke of Prussia paid tribute and swore allegiance to King Sigismund I the Old in Krak\u00f3w's market square on 10 April 1525. Matejko depicted over thirty important figures of the Polish Renaissance period, taking the liberty of including several who were not actually present at the event. The painting glorifies this event in Poland's past and its culture, and the majesty of its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland in the late eighteenth century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others about the history of the no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing fates of history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces."

Other new features included a new scoreboard, press box, dugouts, bullpens, and batting cages.

Spycker Castle is the oldest profane structure on the Baltic Sea island of R\u00fcgen. Spycker was first recorded in 1318. It belonged at that time to the Stralsund patrician family, the von K\u00fclpens. In 1344 a daughter from the House of von K\u00fclpen married the Jasmunds. As a result, the Spyker branch of the von Jasmunds was founded which died without issue in 1648. As a result of the Thirty Years' War, Pomerania, and hence R\u00fcgen, fell to Sweden under the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. As a reward for his wartime services, Queen Christine of Sweden gave the now empty seat of Spycker in 1649 to the Swedish field marshal and later governor-general of Swedish Pomerania, Carl Gustav Wrangel. The castle, originally furnished with a defensive moat, was remodelled after 1650 into its present appearance as a Renaissance schloss and painted in Swedish Falu red, which was atypical of R\u00fcgen. Fully sculptured stucco ceilings, unique in the Baltic region, date to around 1652. After the death of Carl Gustav Wrangel in 1676, the property passed to his daughter Eleanora-Sophia, wife of the Lord of Putbus. Eleanora-Sophia died in 1687, and the property went to the Swedish family of Brahe, with whom her older sister was connected by marriage. After its occupation by the Napoleonic troops in 1806/07 Spycker temporarily became the seat of the French governor of R\u00fcgen. In 1815, R\u00fcgen, which had hitherto been Swedish, was handed over to Prussia. Magnus Fredrik Brahe sold Spycker in 1817 and it came into the possession of Prince Wilhelm Malte I of Putbus. Until the land reform in the Soviet Occupation Zone in 1945, the estate remained in the possession of the von Putbus family. In subsequent years, the castle was left to decay. From the 1960s until 1989, the East German trade union federation, FDGB,  used the castle as a holiday home. Since 1990, the castle has been used as a hotel and, in 1995, it was restored in line with its historical appearance. The hotel has 32 guest rooms. In March 2006, the castle and its 67,000-square-foot estate was purchased at a forced sale by the present owner. The buyer was the architect, Dominik von Boettinger, who, in addition to the hotel and restaurant operation of the castle, also wants to use it as a cultural centre with exhibitions, concerts, readings, and a sculpture park."

North of the stadium is separated by a concrete wall from Lim River, while the south side has a concrete wall with a gate for the eastern stand. West has a main gate plus a small side gate. The condition of the stands is decent, there is a few holes on the west, but overall the stands are durable, unlike some Serbian SuperLiga stadiums that are basically caving in. The current decent condition is mainly thanks to the way the stands were built. Separate blocks cover the cement base, instead of it being made of cement only (West). East is made of cement only and currently is in horrible shape. Grass surface is also getting worse by every season. The stadium needs a renovation as soon as possible, with a possibility of only fixing the western stands, as they are not that bad. Eastern stand has to be completely rebuilt, as it is a practical ruin. But dreams of getting a new stadium in Priboj will probably be left as just that, dreams."

The line remains under construction. The station will be built at a site on Andover's Roseville Road, about  from U.S. Route 206 and about  from County Route 517. On the rail line, it will be located about  west of Port Morris Junction. Anticipated construction at the site includes a station and platform between the track and Roseville Road with 65 parking spaces initially, with room to expand to 125 spaces. Preparation to restore trackage between Port Morris and Andover was originally to begin in 2010 but was delayed until early 2011 due to a dispute over the exact location of the Andover Station area. Another delay was caused while environmental permits were sought. In August 2017, an agreement with a local landowner appeared to have cleared the way for the necessary environmental permits. At the time, service was projected to start in 2020, though in March 2020 it was pushed back to 2025.

The facility was to be privately owned and financed with an approximate size of 500,000 square feet and an 18,000 seat capacity. By early 2018, the proposed arena was cancelled by the City of Virginia Beach. The arena was projected to host events including major concerts, ice shows, trade shows, monster truck rallies, circuses and sporting events. It was to include NCAA/NBA/NHL-ready core features to enable future support of collegiate tournaments and a professional sports franchise. The developer contended that many major events currently bypass Hampton Roads because existing indoor venues, with lower seating capacities, are too small and lack the necessary staging capabilities for large-scale performances. The proposed Virginia Beach Arena would have been the largest in Virginia capable of staging these events. Projected to employ hundreds of full and part-time staff, the Arena's estimated cost was $210 million. The Virginia General Assembly passed legislation that allows the City to dedicate its portion of the Arena-generated state sales tax to satisfy project-related debt. In addition, the City of Virginia Beach, under a plan yet negotiated, will return \"but for\" taxes generated by admissions, food & beverage, and merchandise sales, as well as 1% of the existing hotel tax. The City of Virginia Beach was expected to contribute approximately $52 million to create the infrastructure needed to directly support the Arena. The City would finance this through its existing Tourism Investment Project (TIP) fund. Construction was estimated to take two years after the necessary agreements and permits are in place."

The men featured in the foreground are from left to right Ensign Lambert Woutersz (with orange flag), Sergeant Gabriel Loreyn, Colonel Johan Claesz Loo, Lieutenant Francois Woutersz, Captain Michiel de Wael, Lieutenant Cornelis Coning, Captain Florens van der Hoeff, Captain Nicolaes Grisz Grauwert, Sergeant Lucas van Tetterode, Captain Quirijn Jansz Damast, Ensign Dirck Dicx (with blue flag), and Ensign Pieter Schout (with white flag). The men in the background are from upper left, Sergeant Pieter de Jong, Frans Hals (self-portrait), Ensign Jacob Druyvesteyn, Lieutenant Hendrik Gerritsz Pot, Sergeant Nicolaes van Loo, Sergeant Abraham Cornelisz van der Schalcken, and Lieutenant Hendrick Coning. Though a member of the militia, Frans Hals was never assigned the rank of an officer, though he was clearly admired as an important local artist, as was his fellow portraitist Pot, also portrayed in the rear lineup (and who features in two schutterstukken for the other militia in town - the St Adriansdoelen, or Cluveniers). Historians have speculated whether the self-portrait is indeed Hals, or another absent officer (none of the schutterstukken Hals painted were complete representations of all officers; the men paid for their portraits and some men \"skipped\" a painting). By the time Hals painted this painting, he had been a soldier of the guard for 25 years, and it had been 23 years since he completed his first schutterstuk for this militia, a highly unusual length of time between commissions for any artist of his time. Artist lineup? Besides showing local painters Hals and Pot, two other men in the rear lineup were relatives of local painters; Lieutenant Cornelis Coning was an engraver, Ensign Jacob Druyvesteyn was the son of Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn, and Sergeant Abraham Cornelisz van der Schalcken was the father of Cornelis Symonsz van der Schalcke, who some say painted the original landscape in this painting, though this was partially overpainted in 1702. This was done by local artist Dirk Maas, whose overpainting may have been meant to honor the local artist-architect Pieter Post. Another artist featured in this painting in the foreground is Quirijn Jansz Damast, a respected designer of fine-woven linen, whose work also featured in the tablecloth of Hals' first work for the militia, The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616."

        "content": "The New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung is a newspaper based in New Braunfels, Texas, covering the Comal County area of Central Texas. It publishes five days a week (excluding Sunday and Monday). It is owned by Southern Newspapers. Early Texas German settler and botanist Ferdinand Lindheimer was the first editor when the newspaper began as the weekly German-language publication Neu-Braunfelser Zeitung in 1852. The enterprise, begun to boost the reputation of the city and attract settlers, was backed by political activist Adolph Douai. Subsequent editors throughout the 19th century included Anselm Eiband, Ernest Koebig and Ludolph LaFrentz. After the Zeitung Publishing Company formally organized to run the paper in the late 19th century, G.F. Oheim bought the property in 1899 and was editor/publisher until the time of his death in 1947. Oheim's son, Frederic, succeeded him as owner/editor and added English-language content in 1948 in response to declining numbers of German-language subscribers. In 1954, the newspaper became the Zeitung-Chronicle after merging with the Comal County Chronicle. The weekly English-language New Braunfels Herald (est. 1892), under the long-time leadership of Charles Scruggs, bought the Zeitung-Chronicle in 1957 and the German-language portion was dropped. The company continued to publish both newspapers separately once a week. In 1967, the separate editions were dropped and the merged newspaper published as the English-only weekly Herald and Zeitung. The name was changed to Herald-Zeitung in 1979. Taylor Communications bought the newspaper in 1980, when it became a five-day daily. They sold the Herald-Zeitung to Southern Newspapers in 1984, and it became a morning newspaper in 1986. Charles Scruggs' son, Claude, led the paper from the time of the merger until 1986. He was followed by Susan Haire and then editor/publisher David Sullens (1991\u201396). Under publisher Doug Toney (1996-2012), the Herald-Zeitung won over 100 statewide awards across all departments. A serious flood damaged the company's offices, archives and Goss press in 1998, leading to a relocation of the printing facilities. A Saturday edition was added in 2000."

Officially unveiled on March 9 and launched on April 7, 2015 the service allows subscribers on-demand access to HBO's library of original programs, films and other content on personal computers, smartphones, tablet devices and digital media players. Unlike HBO Go, HBO's online video on demand service for existing subscribers of the linear television channel, HBO Now was available as a standalone service and does not require a television subscription to use, targeting cord cutters who use competing services such as Netflix and Hulu. As of February 2018, HBO Now had 5 million subscribers. HBO Now was succeeded on May 27, 2020 by HBO Max and became deprecated soon after the latter's launch. Subscribers of the linear HBO television service and HBO Now were able to migrate to HBO Max at no additional cost, although some providers did not immediately reach such agreements (Amazon did not reach an agreement until mid-November, while Roku would not reach a deal until mid-December 2020). The \"HBO Now\" branding was dropped at the end of July, while the service and app remained available for Roku and select TiVo users; support for the HBO streaming app was formally sunset on December 17, 2020, when Roku replaced it with HBO Max."
