The monument is located within Deland Park along the Lake Michigan shoreline of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, which contains one of the larger Hmong communities in the United States. It was dedicated on July 15, 2006. Sheboygan was among the first United States cities to accept Hmong asylum seekers and immigrants in late 1976, after the victory of a communist government in Laos.\nThe memorial is intended to honor and memorialize all the Hmong who fought against communism. It includes 24 panels dedicated to military personnel who were a part of the Hmong Secret Guerrilla Unit Army that fought against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in the Secret War, as well as all civilian participants. The monument was vandalized in 2008. In June 2010, a painted centerpiece (pang dao) was added, consisting of a green circle with traditional white needlework.The United States did not acknowledge the Secret War until 1997, under the administration of President Bill Clinton, as a result of Hmong and Congressional pressure. In 2004, following several years of pressure from a coalition of U.S. conservatives and liberal human rights activists, the U.S. government reversed a policy of denying immigration to Hmong who had fled Laos in the 1990s for refugee camps in Thailand. In a major victory for the refugees, the US government recognized some 15,000 Hmong as asylum seekers and afforded them expedited U.S. immigration rights."

        "content": "The Bull Stone House is located in the Town of Hamptonburgh, New York. It is a ten-room stone house built in the 1720s by William Bull and Sarah Wells, pioneer settlers of Central Orange County, NY. It is one of the few homes in America still owned and occupied by the same family. The current resident is a ninth generation descendant of the couple.\nBull, a stonemason, met and married Wells in the Wawayanda Patent (much of the present day towns of Goshen, Hamptonburgh, Minisink, and Warwick) while they were both working for the patent proprietors.\nSarah Wells, an orphan, arrived in the area as the Goshen's first female settler in 1712. She came there to work as an indentured house servant at the age of sixteen.  In 1715 Bull arrived in North America from Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England and also came to work on the Wawayanda Patent, where they met. He was the hired mason for Daniel Crommelin, a French immigrant and New York City merchant.\nTheir marriage in 1718, was the first between European settlers in Goshen. Building the house was a joint effort between husband and wife. William bought 100 acres in 1718 adjacent to Christopher Denne's land. Denne was Sarah Wells' master. Eventually, the widow Elizabeth Denne sold 100 acres to William and Sarah's first son, John, when he was just 8 years old. It is family lore that the widow was fulfilling a promise Denne made to Sarah to convince her to act as his land agent in the land claim. The Bull Stone House still stands today and is in the possession of the William Bull and Sarah Wells Stone House Association.\nWhen construction began, Sarah carried some of the stones to the site and William cut and laid them, while they lived in a temporary log cabin. It took thirteen years to complete, surviving a 1727 earthquake in the process. (Other sources place the date of the house's construction as 1722 or 1727). The completed building stands 40 feet square (1,600 sq ft (150 m2)) and has walls 2 feet thick.The house was reportedly used as a safe haven during the seven years of the French and Indian War though no known fighting or battle was waged on the property. Sarah and William raised 12 children to adulthood in the house. Each of the children married and had children of their own.\nWilliam built many stone houses around what is now known as Orange County. In the last year of William's life, 1756, he completed a stone house in New Windsor now called Knox Headquarters, which was the headquarters of several American generals during the American Revolution.\nTheir descendants dispersed within the adjacent region, with the houses of Thomas (now a county museum) and William III also on the National Register. The family has lent its name to the hamlet of Bullville and Thomas Bull Memorial Park.\nSarah Wells survived William Bull, who died in 1755\u201356. She remarried Johannes Miller sometime between 1756 and 1769, but separated from him in 1770. She moved back to her Stone House, where she died at the age of 100 years and 15 days, leaving 335 direct descendants. The county government has renamed Orange County Route 8, near the house, to Sarah Wells Trail, in her honor. The local Girl Scouts council was named for her as well.Both Sarah and William are buried on the property next to Hamptonburgh Cemetery on Sarah Wells Trail.\nThe house and surrounding property have remained in the Bull family's ownership. In 1920 the family incorporated as an association of descendants. Today a ninth-generation descendant lives at the house as the resident family caretaker. Tours are available for the general public for a small fee. Descendants from all over the United States have returned to the house every year since 1868 for a family reunion. The house has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1974.\nThe 120-acre (49 ha) William Bull and Sarah Wells homestead boasts another historical structure of significance, a New World Dutch barn."

It is open weekday mornings, but reservations must be made in advance and an admission fee is charged.\nThe garden's site was formerly a Royal palace of Portici built 1738-1748 by Charles III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily. After the Bourbons' departure in 1860, today's gardens were founded in 1872 with the Royal Higher School of Agriculture. The park was enlarged by a further 36 hectares at that time, and two ornamental gardens (about 9000 square meters) created, which were then transformed into botanical gardens by Nicola Antonio Pedicino, the school's first botany professor. In 1935 the school became part of the University of Naples, and subsequently occupied by allied troops during World War II, destroying many plants, but from 1948 its collections have been restored and enlarged.\nThe gardens currently contain over 4000 specimens representing about 1000 species. The most important collection are desert plants, which include over 600 species from Agavaceae, Aizoaceae, Cactaceae (about 400 species), Didiereaceae, and Euphorbiaceae.

To cater to workers of the Tangguh LNG plant, the airport was reactivated and developed after years of lying dormant. The development not only consist of paving the airport runway, but also defusing no fewer than 360 active bombs scattered in the airport area left by the Dutch on the midst of the Pacific War during World War II. The defusing of the bombs, which was assisted by the Indonesian Army Combat Engineers, took place in 2002.

The station also operates a rebroadcast transmitter (CKEM-DT-1, channel 4) in Red Deer.\nCKEM was built as part of A-Channel, the regional television service constructed by Craig Broadcast Systems in 1997. Broadcasting from studios downtown in the historic Hudson's Bay Building, it was the first new commercial TV station in Edmonton since 1974; its style of news and programming was young and aggressive. The station also broadcast Edmonton Oilers hockey for its first several years on air. Ratings settled into third place, above the CBC but behind the established stations in town, CFRN and CITV. However, the station lost ratings momentum following a five-month strike by unionized employees.\nCraig, overextended by its launch of Toronto 1 in 2003, sold itself to CHUM Limited, then-owner of Citytv, in 2004. CHUM moved other media properties into the Hudson's Bay Building, including a new radio station and Access Media Group; in 2005, the A-Channel stations took on the Citytv brand. Due to poor ratings and as part of a wave of layoffs, CHUM reduced the size of its local operation in Edmonton in 2006, cancelling the station's evening newscast. CHUM sold most of its assets to Bell Globemedia that same year; as Bell owned the CTV Television Network, the Citytv stations were spun off to Rogers. The station continued producing a morning newscast under the Breakfast Television brand until 2015 and reinstated evening local news programs in 2017."

It is built on a group of 126 islands that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions of the city are linked by 472 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 51,000 live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for almost a millennium, from 810 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce\u2014especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. For centuries Venice possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen today. The Venetian Arsenal is considered by several historians to be the first factory in history, and was the base of Venice's naval power. The sovereignty of Venice came to an end in 1797, at the hands of Napoleon. Subsequently, in 1866, the city became part of the Kingdom of Italy.Venice has been known as \"La Dominante\", \"La Serenissima\", \"Queen of the Adriatic\", \"City of Water\", \"City of Masks\", \"City of Bridges\", \"The Floating City\", and \"City of Canals\". The lagoon and the historic parts of the city within the lagoon were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, covering an area of 70,176.4 hectares (173,410 acres). In view of the fact that Venice and its lagoon are under constant threat in terms of their ecology and the safeguarding of the cultural heritage, Venice's UNESCO listing has been under constant examination by UNESCO. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. Venice is known for several important artistic movements \u2013 especially during the Renaissance period \u2013 and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music; it is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi.In the 21st century, Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city in the world. It has been described by The Times as one of Europe's most romantic cities and by The New York Times as \"undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man\". However, the city faces challenges including an excessive number of tourists, pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing too close to buildings."

A 600 feet (180 m) high, narrow escarpment extends south then southeastwards for a total of 55 kilometres (34 mi) from a short distance east of the border. It hems in east-facing small harbour town of as-Salum, continuing as an east-facing sea cliff further north. Land to the east is lower than that to the west and the east side has steep slopes. \nThe pass is centred 1.6 miles (2.6 km) inland from the closest part of the shore. It makes for a subtle wind gap in the escarpment for the east-west land route. It made for the southern Mediterranean coastal road useful to Mediterranean civilizations until the pass at as-Salum was enlarged after World War II.\nAmong veterans of Allied forces from 15 June 1941 and thereafter it was nicknamed Hellfire Pass.\nThe escarpment is known as Akabah el-Kebir \"great ascent\". To El-Edrisi it was known as \u02bfAqaba as-Sall\u016bm \"graded ascent\", whence the modern name of the gulf/bay and the town of Salum. To ancient Rome it was known as Catabathmus Magnus, in the peak of whose empire it divorced Aegyptus from Marmarica.

It drains more than one-quarter of the country as it winds along the northern edge of the Maya Mountains to the sea just north of Belize City (17\u00b032\u2032N 88\u00b014\u2032W). The Belize river valley is largely tropical rainforest.\nAlso known as the Old River, the Belize River begins where the Mopan River and Macal River join just east of San Ignacio, Belize (17\u00b011\u2032N 89\u00b004\u2032W). The Belize River \u2013 Mopan River Catchment contains over 45 percent of the population of Belize. The Belize River, in spite of 78 runs or rapids, is passable via the Mopan to the Guatemalan border. It served as the main artery of commerce and communication between the interior and the coast until well into the twentieth century, and has long been associated with forestry, of logwood (for dye) and of mahogany which survives in small stands.:\u200a111\u200aEarly on, loggers using the river encountered the Maya and had conflicts with them and with the Spaniards. In 1807 there was a request for \"arms and ammunitions\" for the loggers. In the late 1820s, the Methodist minister Thomas Wilkinson found three to four thousand men working at camps most of the year.:\u200a55\u200a By the late 19th century there were over 130 small settlements along the river. Burrell Boom just above Belize Town served as a catch-point for logs.\nToday the Belize River is a vital source of drinking water and other domestic use for the populations living along the river; however, water quality is degraded from sediment, nutrient loading, pesticides and other toxins. The major source of degradation is the extensive deforestation in the upper reaches of the Mopan River and non-sustainable agriculture. Karper and Boles have asserted: \"The greater Mopan/Belize River Catchment provides a prime example of a watershed under stress from extensive non-sustainable agricultural practices that have occurred within the region over the past three decades.\" Traditional slash and burn agricultural practices also contribute to watershed degradation."

Located in western Abruzzo in central Italy, the town of Avezzano lies to the northwest, Ortucchio to the southeast, and Trasacco to the southwest of the historic lake. Once the third largest lake in Italy after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore, it was finally drained in 1878.The plain is a geographical depression of tectonic origin formed during the Apennine orogeny between the Pliocene and Quaternary.To the west, Fucino borders the Palentini plains, while the Giovenco, Vallelonga, and Roveto valleys converge towards the Fucine plain. Due to the absence of outlets and the sudden variations in the water level causing floods or unhealthy drying, it was the subject of numerous attempts at regulation. The first partial draining of the endorheic basin was carried out by the Roman emperor Claudius in 52 CE. \nThe total draining of the Fucian basin was undertaken in the second half of the 19th century by Jean Fran\u00e7ois Mayor de Montricher, who expanded the hydraulic works of the Roman era by increasing the number of wells and expanding the vents and underground canals. These works and others drained Lake Fucino by 1878.\nAn improvement in socio-economic conditions followed its draining and the resultant plain is one of the most fertile vegetable growing areas in Italy. Products that have obtained European Protected geographical indication marks include the Fucino potato and the Fucino plateau carrot.Along the former Fucino shoreline, in addition to Avezzano (the largest city), are other populous municipalities including Celano and Pescina.\nIn addition to agriculture, the plain also hosts the Fucino Space Centre. The teleport commenced construction in 1963 by the Telespazio company and is used for the ground management of artificial satellites in orbit for telecommunications."

President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, ordering people of Japanese ancestry to be incarcerated in what were euphemistically called \"relocation centers\" like Topaz during World War II. Most of the people incarcerated at Topaz came from the Tanforan Assembly Center and previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. The camp was opened in September 1942 and closed in October 1945.\nThe camp, approximately 15 miles (24.1 km) west of Delta, Utah, consisted of 19,800 acres (8,012.8 ha), with a 640 acres (259.0 ha) main living area. Most internees lived in the main living area, though some lived off-site as agricultural and industrial laborers. The approximately 9,000 internees and staff made Topaz into the fifth-largest city in Utah at the time. The extreme temperature fluctuations of the arid area combined with uninsulated barracks made conditions very uncomfortable, even after the belated installation of pot-bellied stoves. The camp housed two elementary schools and a high school, a library, and some recreational facilities. Camp life was documented in a newspaper, Topaz Times, and in the literary publication Trek. Internees worked inside and outside the camp, mostly in agricultural labor. Many internees became notable artists.\nIn the winter of 1942\u20131943, a loyalty questionnaire asked prisoners if they would declare their loyalty to the United States of America and if they would be willing to enlist. The questions were divisive, and prisoners who were considered \"disloyal\" because of their answers on the loyalty questionnaire were sent to the Tule Lake Segregation Camp. One internee, James Wakasa, was shot and killed for being too close to the camp's fence. Topaz prisoners held a large funeral and stopped working until administrators relaxed security.\nIn 1983, Jane Beckwith founded the Topaz Museum Board. Topaz became a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2007. After many years of organizing, fundraising, and collecting information and artifacts, the Topaz Museum was built in Delta and debuted with a display of the art created at Topaz. Permanent exhibits, installed in 2017, chronicle the people who were interned there and tell their stories."

However, deregulation in 1978 changed the competitive landscape and realities, as noted by Smithsonian Airline Historian R. E. G. Davies, \"Unfortunately, the policies that had been successful for more than forty years under (Robert) Six's cavalier style of management were suddenly laid bare as the cold winds of airline deregulation changed all the rules\u2014specifically, the balance between revenues and expenditures.\"In 1981, Texas International Airlines acquired a controlling interest in Continental.  The companies were merged in 1982, moved to Houston, and grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial and labor issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.\nContinental and United Airlines merged in an $8.5 billion all-stock merger of equals on October 1, 2010. Continental's shareholders received 1.05 per share in United stock for each Continental share they owned. Upon completion of the acquisition, UAL Corporation changed their name to United Continental Holdings. During the integration period, each airline ran a separate operation under the direction of a combined leadership team, based in Chicago. The integration was completed on March 3, 2012. Although the merged airline retained the United name, it uses Continental's operating certificate and livery. On June 27, 2019, United changed its parent company name from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings."

Inside the tunnel, at 1,237 metres (4,058 ft) elevation, is the highest point on the Norwegian railway network.The tunnel was constructed to increase the regularity of the line past the Finse peak which was often blocked by snow. Planning started during the 1980s to remove this section that was regularly snowed down, and at the same time reduce the length and increase the speed of the railway. Construction started in 1990, and it was opened by King Harald V on 16 May 1993. Following the construction of the tunnel, 32 kilometres (20 mi) of railway around this area was also rebuilt to achieve higher train speeds, a shorter overall distance, and to maximize the natural protection from the weather.  This was built in five stages, opening between 1995 and 1998."

It stands directly in front of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka.\nEdwin Lawson Koch was born on 29 November 1838 in Jaffna, the son of John Godfried Koch, a local proctor and Angenita Dordthea Aldons. Koch originally qualified at the Bengal Medical College in Calcutta before obtaining his Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Aberdeen.

Koch was one of the first lecturers at the Colombo Medical School when it opened in 1870 and succeeded Dr. James Loos as principal in 1875. On 20 December 1877 he died of sepsis from a wound he received whilst performing an autopsy. He is recorded to have been \"a bold Surgeon, a successful Physician and an expert Obstetrician\". Through the efforts of Dr. J. L. Vanderstraaten (one of the other lecturers at Colombo Medical School) Rs 3,000 was raised by public subscription for the construction of a clock tower, with Sir James Longden, the Governor at the time, on behalf of the government, donating the clock, which cost Rs. 5,000.\nThe plaque on the clock tower carries the inscription: \"In memory of E. L. Koch, M.D. Principal Medical College Erected by Public Subscription and Civic Medical Officers 1881\".\nThe clock and tower were recently restored with gratitude for great genes by the great great grand children of E.L.

The uprising was put down by Colonel H\u00e9ctor Benigno Varela's 10th Cavalry Regiment of the Argentine Army under the orders of President Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen. Approximately 300-1,500 rural workers were shot and killed by the 10th Cavalry Regiment in the course of the operations, many of them executed by firing squads after surrendering. Most of the executed were Spanish and Chilean workers who had sought refuge in Argentina's Patagonia after their strike in the city of Puerto Natales in southern Chile in 1919 was crushed by the Chilean authorities, at the cost of four carabiniers killed and the offices of their union were burned by the civilians, policemen and the militaries in Punta Arenas on July 27, 1920. At least two Argentine soldiers (privates Fernando Pablo Fischer and Domingo Montenegro), three local policemen (sergeant Tom\u00e1s Rosa and constables Ernesto Boz\u00e1n and Juan Campos) and a number of ranch owners and their relatives also died during the strife.

The group is based around a wiki, which enables people to register their own tree planting events, to find like-minded friends in their region, and to network with foresters and other tree experts. As of 2016, events have taken place in Berlin, Brandenburg, G\u00f6ttingen, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany as well as in H\u00eerbov\u0103\u021b in Moldova. It is hoped that the idea will spread, with further volunteers getting involved in organising tree planting events using the WikiWoods software as a coordinating platform.\nWikiWoods plants according to a set of sustainability guidelines that were specially developed for the group. The events that have been carried out so far include afforestation, the conversion of monoculture coniferous forests into mixed woodland, the planting of hedges and forest edges, as well as the planting, harvesting, and pruning of fruit trees.\nIn order to ensure the future protection of the trees that are planted, WikiWoods works with environmental partners who provide the land and take responsibility for their ongoing care. Partner organizations include WWF, BUND, NABU National Heritage Foundation (NABU-Stiftung Nationales Naturerbe), and the Lower Oder Valley National Park.\nWikiWoods is supported by sponsor organization Active Commons e.V., which provides funds for planting projects and the operation of the Internet platform. WikiWoods is a member of the Climate-Alliance Germany."

It has since been involved in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest, campaigns to improve working conditions and immigrant worker empowerment in various Korean ethnic industries, the living wages campaign, and Koreatown's multi-ethnic community developments.\nKIWA is perhaps best known recently for its long campaign against Assi Market, the largest ethnic Korean-owned supermarket of the United States, located in Koreatown. Started in the late 1990s, KIWA demands that Assi management rehire dozens of fired Latino and Korean workers who were fired for trying to organize a trade union.\nAlthough initially staffed mostly by ethnic Koreans, KIWA grew to encompass Asian-Pacific American and Latino organizers and members. The Spanish language \"Alianza de trabajadores inmigrantes del Barrio Coreano\" had been in common use since the early 2000s; however the English language name was officially changed in March 2006 from Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates to Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance. The Korean language \"\ud55c\uc778\ub178\ub3d9\uc0c1\ub2f4\uc18c\" (Korean Worker's Center) has been changed to \ud55c\uc778\ud0c0\uc6b4 \ub178\ub3d9\uc5f0\ub300 to signify its geographical focus rather than on an ethnic group.\nKIWA is a member organization of MIWON (Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers Alliance [1]), an alliance of four (formerly five) immigrant worker centers in the Los Angeles area, and ENLACE, a U.S.-Mexico network of worker centers."

The city is situated around Kings Bay, which is spring-fed so it keeps a constant 72 \u00b0F (22 \u00b0C) temperature year round. A cluster of 50 springs designated as a first-magnitude system feeds Kings Bay. A first-magnitude system discharges 100 cubic feet or more of water per second, which equals about 64 million gallons of water per day. Because of this discharge amount, the Crystal River Springs group is the second largest springs group in Florida, the first being Wakulla Springs in Wakulla County near Tallahassee. Kings Bay can be home to over 400 manatees during the winter when the water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico cools, and is the only place in the United States where people can legally interact with them in their natural conditions without that interaction being viewed as harassment by law enforcement agencies. Tourism based on watching and swimming with manatees is the fastest growing contribution to the local economy.

While Napoleon's army mauled an Allied army under Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher, the main Allied army commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, advanced to a position dangerously close to Paris. Gathering up his outnumbered forces, Napoleon rushed his soldiers south to deal with Schwarzenberg. Hearing of the approach of the French emperor, the Allied commander ordered a withdrawal, but on 17 February saw his rear guards overrun or brushed aside.\nOrdered to hold Montereau until nightfall on 18 February, the Crown Prince of W\u00fcrttemberg posted a strong force on the north bank of the Seine River. All morning and past noon, the Allies stoutly held off a series of French attacks. However, under increasing French pressure, the Crown Prince's lines buckled in the afternoon and his troops ran for the single bridge to their rear. Brilliantly led by Pierre Claude Pajol, the French cavalry got among the fugitives, captured the spans over both the Seine and Yonne Rivers and seized Montereau. The Allied force suffered heavy losses, and the defeat confirmed Schwarzenberg's decision to continue the retreat to Troyes."

The money for these subsidies was generated through an exclusive tax on companies which processed farm products. The Act created a new agency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, also called \"AAA\" (1933\u20131942), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to oversee the distribution of the subsidies. The Agriculture Marketing Act, which established the Federal Farm Board in 1929, was seen as an important precursor to this act. The AAA, along with other New Deal programs, represented the federal government's first substantial effort to address economic welfare in the United States."

The museum is located at the Henry Clay Frick House, a Beaux-Arts mansion designed for Henry Clay Frick. The Frick also houses the Frick Art Reference Library, an art history research center established by Frick's daughter Helen Clay Frick in 1920, which contains sales catalogs, books, periodicals, and photographs.\nThe museum dates to 1920, when the trustees of Frick's estate formed the Frick Collection Inc. to care for his art collection, which he had bequeathed for public use. After Frick's wife Adelaide Frick died in 1931, John Russell Pope converted the Frick House into a museum, which opened on December 16, 1935. The museum acquired additional works of art over the years, and it expanded the house in 1977 to accommodate increasing visitation. Following fundraising campaigns in the 2000s, a further expansion was announced in the 2010s. The museum was temporarily housed at 945 Madison Avenue from 2021 to 2024, during the renovation of the Frick House.\nThe Frick has about 1,500 pieces in its collection as of 2021. Artists with works in the collection have included Bellini, Fragonard, Goya, Holbein, Rembrandt, Titian, Turner, Vel\u00e1zquez, Vermeer, and Thomas Gainsborough. The museum has gradually acquired additional pieces over the years to supplement the paintings in Frick's original collection. In addition to its permanent collection, the museum has hosted small temporary exhibitions on narrowly defined topics, as well as  academic symposiums, concerts, and classes. The Frick Collection typically accommodates up to 300,000 annual visitors and has an endowment fund to support its programming. Commentary on the museum over the years has been largely positive, particularly in relation to the works themselves and their juxtaposition with the Frick House."

Ravenna Creek's current source is a wetland in the northwest corner of Cowen Park, at NE 62nd Street and Brooklyn Avenue NE. It is also fed by springs throughout Ravenna Park, and is joined there by a second branch which begins near the intersection of NE 65th Street and 23rd Avenue NE. Until 2006, the creek ended at a sewer grate where the park's trail system opened into a soccer field.\nA daylighting project completed in May 2006 disconnected the creek from the sewer system and extended its bed 650 feet (200 m) towards the southeast corner of Ravenna Park, at which point it enters a pipeline. This pipeline, which runs southward along 25th Avenue NE to the NE 45th Street viaduct, empties into University Slough, thereby reconnecting Ravenna Creek to Lake Washington.\nIn 2008, a major sewage spill of 8,000,000 US gallons (30,000,000 L) of raw sewage flooded the creek in an accident caused by King County utility crews working nearby."

Selena Etc. finished its building on January 27, 1994, in Corpus Christi, Texas, which was the headquarters. \nSelena opened another boutique in San Antonio, Texas, around the same time the headquarters building was complete; both were equipped with in-house beauty salons.Among the employees there was the president of her fan club, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, who had been promoted to manager of her two boutiques, as well as controlling Selena's business checking accounts. However, she would lose this position after several employees began to approach Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, and they informed him that they had overdue payments on their payrolls, so upon initiating an investigation in this regard, Quintanilla was convinced that Sald\u00edvar was embezzling money.On March 9, 1995, Abraham, Selena, and her sister Suzette confronted Sald\u00edvar and accused her of stealing money from the boutiques and the fan club, firing her immediately, although Selena continued to contact her due to the fact that she had several financial documents in her possession that she needed to have back. Another boutique was planned to open in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1995, but on March 31 of that year, Sald\u00edvar would murder Selena by shooting her in the back after asking her to meet at the Days Inn motel in order to return her the financial records and documents she still had. After her death, Chris P\u00e9rez, Selena's widower, took over the business. The San Antonio boutique was closed sometime after 1999.After the 16th anniversary of the opening of the Corpus Christi boutique, the store was officially closed as of July 1, 2009. A week after the store closed, P\u00e9rez placed a \"for sale\" sign in front of the building. The appraised price of the land and structure was USD$91,454 according to the Nueces County Appraisal District. Perez' asking price for the property was $165,000. The Selena Etc. store had a full-service salon, as well as Selena memorabilia. They also sold jewelry, hats and other accessories. Soon after the foreclosure, due to the low economy, all merchandise and accessories began selling at the \"Selena Museum\", located several miles from where the Selena Etc. building once was.\n\n\n== References =="

The house was bought by the Bolivian explorer and entrepreneur Antonio Vaca Diez.\n\nLa Casa de Fierro is one of the finest as well as best-preserved samples of civil architecture in Peru. The walls, ceiling, and balcony are plastered in rectangular sheets of iron. It is said to be the first prefabricated house in the Americas. Although popularly said to have been designed by the French architect Gustave Eiffel, there is no evidence at all that this is true; the building does not reflect his architectural style. Since 2011 well substantiated claims prove it was built in the Belgian workshops of Les Forges d'Aiseau (Joseph Danly process). Rubber baron Anselmo del Aguila bought it at the International Exposition of Paris in 1889. Once dismantled, it was brought in pieces to Iquitos (the metal sheets were carried by hundreds of men through the jungle), and assembled there in 1890.Since 1985, it is being administered by the Club Social de Iquitos; which has contributed in its restoration. Its second floor now has a restaurant. Today the house servers as a restaurant in the second, La Casa de Fierro Restaurante, and stores in the ground level.\nA fully different story of the origin of the house is told in Mario Vargas Llosa's Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (Pantale\u00f3n y las visitadoras), a comic novel."

The license is held by Fondation Radio-Enfant, a non-profit educational agency. CJEU\u2019s transmitter is located off of Chem des Terres in Musee, Quebec.\nFondation Radio-Enfant was originally granted a short-term license, with the call sign CIRC, on 96.5 FM for the duration of the Rendez-vous de la Francophonie in 2002 and in 2003, Fondation Radio-Enfant was also granted to operate at 1250 kHz on the AM dial (formerly used by CBOF), however, due to possible technical issues, the station never went on the air. The 96.5 frequency in Gatineau was later reassigned to CFTX-FM, and Fondation Radio-Enfant was granted a permanent AM license in early 2007 to operate at 1670 kHz.Initially, CJEU played music mainly in French and sung by children. Most of the music that is played, however, was not professionally recorded.In late 2010, the station was renamed as Radio Oxyg\u00e8ne, expanding its programming to include programs for teenagers and young adults. Programming for younger listeners was renamed Radio-Enfant-Ado. At one point, the station was known as Radio Jeunesse.\nIn 2015, the CRTC approved an ownership change for CJEU from Fondation Radio Enfant du Canada to Radio Communautaire Enfant-Ado de Gatineau-Ottawa.On August 15, 2019, the CRTC issued a short-term license renewal for CJEU from September 1, 2019 to August 31, 2023.  The short-term renewal would allow for an earlier review of the licensee\u2019s compliance with regulatory requirements. The broadcasting status of CJEU is currently unknown. On March 25, 2024, after being off the air for a year and a half and while waiting for funding to get their transmitter repaired, CJEU briefly returned to the air at 1670 AM and then went off the air again on March 27 due to technical difficulties. More funding and transmitter repairs will be required. The station, Radio Jeunesse had been streaming live online over the internet only."

        "content": "The Embargo Act of 1807 was a general trade embargo on all foreign nations that was enacted by the United States Congress. As a successor or replacement law for the 1806 Non-importation Act and passed as the Napoleonic Wars continued, it represented an escalation of attempts to persuade Britain to stop any impressment of American sailors and to respect American sovereignty and neutrality but also attempted to pressure France and other nations in the pursuit of general diplomatic and economic leverage.\nIn the first decade of the 19th century, American shipping grew. During the Napoleonic Wars, rival nations Britain and France targeted neutral American shipping as a means to disrupt the trade of the other nation. American merchantmen who were trading with \"enemy nations\" were seized as contraband of war by European navies. The British Royal Navy had impressed American sailors who had either been British-born or previously serving on British ships, even if they now claimed to be American citizens with American papers. Incidents such as the Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair outraged Americans.\nCongress imposed the embargo in direct response to these events. President Thomas Jefferson acted with restraint, weighed public support for retaliation, and recognized that the United States was militarily far weaker than either Britain or France. He recommended that Congress respond with commercial warfare, a policy that appealed to Jefferson both for being experimental and for foreseeably harming his domestic political opponents more than his allies, whatever its effect on the European belligerents. The 10th Congress was controlled by his allies and agreed to the Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 1807.\nIn terms of diplomacy, the Embargo failed to improve the American diplomatic position, and sharply increased international political tensions. Both widespread evasion of the embargo and loopholes in the legislation reduced its impact on its targets. British commercial shipping, which already dominated global trade, was successfully adapting to Napoleon's Continental System by pursuing new markets, particularly in the restive Spanish and  Portuguese colonies in South America. Thus, British merchants were well-positioned to grow at American expense when the embargo sharply reduced American trade activity.\nThe Act's prohibition on imports stimulated the growth of nascent US domestic industries across the board, particularly the textile industry, and marked the beginning of the manufacturing system in the United States, reducing the nation's dependence upon imported manufactured goods.Americans opposed to the Act launched bitter protests, particularly in New England commercial centers. Support for the declining Federalist Party, which intensely opposed Jefferson, temporarily rebounded and drove electoral gains in 1808 (Senate and House). On  March 1, 1809, the Replacement legislation for the embargo was enacted during the last days of Jefferson's presidency. Tensions with Britain continued to grow and eventually led to the War of 1812."

For the one-way portions of Charles Street, the street is functionally complemented by the parallel St. Paul Street, including St. Paul Place and Preston Gardens, Maryland Avenue, Cathedral Street, and Liberty Street.\nThough not exactly at the west\u2013east midpoint of the city, Charles Street is the dividing line between the west and east sides of Baltimore.  On any street that crosses Charles Street, address numbers start from the unit block on either side, and the streets are identified as either \"West\" or \"East,\" depending on whether they are to the west or east of Charles.The west and east designations also apply to streets that do not cross Charles Street, but exist on both sides of it. The entire length of Charles Street is a National Scenic Byway known as Baltimore's Historic Charles Street."

The park covers one city block, bounded by Main, Capitol, Walnut, and Washington Streets.The park was renamed \"Confederate Park\" in 1923, at request of United Daughters of the Confederacy.The park contains several historic structures, including a Victorian-era gazebo near the corner of Walnut Avenue and Washington Street, the Demopolis City Hall, built in 1869\u201370 as a courthouse annex, and the old Presbyterian Church, built in 1843 and now known as Rooster Hall.  The former church served as the Marengo County Courthouse from 1868 until 1871, when the county seat was temporarily moved from Linden. The park's center features a large cast iron fountain that was installed in 1895. The park is often used for the city's festivals, most notably for many of the Christmas on the River events.  The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 29 November 1975.\n\n\n== References =="

The exterior is composed entirely of cream colored terra cotta. Dentil ornamentation is found across the top of the building. Initially, the building was a single story with 25-foot (7.6 m) ceilings, but it was altered to its present form in 1956. The glass wall of the main facade was also added at that time.

The first secessions in 1841 took place in Michigan although the new church group was formalized in Utica, New York. In November 1842, Orange Scott, La Roy Sunderland and J. Horton seceded from the Methodist Episcopal Church for reasons given in their publication of the True Wesleyan. The first general conference was held in Utica, NY, in October 1844.\nThe Wesleyan Methodist Church fell into the category of Holiness Methodist Pacifists, as it opposed war as documented in its Book of Disciplines, which stated that the Gospel is in \"every way opposed to the practice of War in all its forms; and those customs which tend to foster and perpetuate war spirit, [are] inconsistent with the benevolent designs of the Christian religion.\"  They also cited tolerance of the Methodist Episcopal Church of \"so horrible a crime\" as slavery as a reason for their secession.The Wesleyan Methodist Church merged with the Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1968, and became known as The Wesleyan Church. This was largely driven by the trend toward denominational mergers during the 1960s and the belief their similarities were greater than their differences.  As such, they believed they could be more effective becoming one group. Several conferences in both merging denominations refused to be a part of the merged church over differences about modesty and worldliness (some of the conferences did not permit their members to have television sets, and required the women to have uncut hair in keeping with their interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:15). One of the largest conferences which refused to join the merger was the Allegheny Conference with over 100 churches. It became the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection of Churches, and most of the churches are still known as Wesleyan Methodist, e.g. Salem Wesleyan Methodist Church. Other Wesleyan Methodists who dissented with the merger organized into the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches and the Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee."

        "content": "The Francization of Brussels refers to the evolution, over the past two centuries, of this historically Dutch-speaking city into one where French has become the majority language and lingua franca. The main cause of this transition was the rapid, compulsory assimilation of the Flemish population, amplified by immigration from France and Wallonia.The rise of French in public life gradually began by the end of the 18th century, quickly accelerating as the new capital saw a major increase in population following Belgian independence. Dutch \u2014 of which standardization in Belgium was still very weak \u2014 could not compete with French, which was the exclusive language of the judiciary, the administration, the army, education, high culture and the media. The value and prestige of the French language was so universally acknowledged that after 1880, and more particularly after the turn of the century, proficiency in French among Dutch-speakers increased spectacularly.Although the majority of the population remained bilingual until the second half of the 20th century, the original Brabantian dialect was often no longer passed on from one generation to another, leading to an increase of monolingual French-speakers from 1910 onwards. This language shift weakened after the 1960s, as the language border was fixed, the status of Dutch as an official language was confirmed, and the economic center of gravity shifted northward to Flanders.However, with the continuing arrival of immigrants (most either from French-speaking countries or more familiar with French) and the post-war emergence of Brussels as a center of international politics, the relative position of Dutch continued to decline. Simultaneously, as Brussels' urban area expanded, a further number of Dutch-speaking municipalities in the Brussels periphery also became predominantly French-speaking. This phenomenon of expanding Francization (dubbed the \"oil slick\" by its opponents), remains, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in Belgian politics and public discourse."

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its architectural significance.Attorneys for the construction, plumbing and electrical companies that had previously won a court judgment for unpaid work at the museum joined to purchase the property for $1.3 million: the total amount a judge found that they are owed. The group was the sole bidder at the public auction.\nBeginning in 2008, the Minnesota African American Museum and Cultural Center occupied the structure. The museum began a $6 million fundraising effort to renovate it. Although the museum spent several million dollars on improvements, its fundraising effort failed to cover the cost of renovations. Creditors won a lawsuit in September 2015 evicting the museum. The creditors now jointly own the property. In 2016, the property and adjoining carriage house were divided into 9 apartments."

Reservations in the new territory were then opened to settlement in a series of land runs in 1890, 1891, and 1893.\nSeven counties were defined upon the creation of the territory. They were originally designated by number and eventually became Logan, Cleveland, Oklahoma, Canadian, Kingfisher, Payne, and Beaver counties. The Land Run of 1893 led to the addition of Kay, Grant, Woods, Garfield, Noble, and Pawnee counties. The territory acquired an additional county through the resolution of a boundary dispute with Texas, which today is split into Greer, Jackson, Harmon, and part of Beckham counties."

Surrounded by high mountains, it is roughly 15 miles due north of the city, which makes this mountain the most popular climb in Bolivia. The normal ascent route is a fairly straightforward glacier climb, with some crevasses and a steep climb to the summit. However, the other side of the mountain\u2014Huayna Potos\u00ed West Face\u2014is the biggest face in Bolivia. Several difficult snow and ice routes ascend this 1,000-meter-high face.\nThe first ascent of the normal route was undertaken in 1919 by Germans Rudolf Dienst and Adolf Schulze. Some climbing books report this mountain as the \"easiest 6,000er in the world\", but this claim is debatable. The easiest route entails an exposed ridge and sections of moderately steep ice, with a UIAA rating of PD. There are many 6,000 m mountains that are easier to climb in terms of technical difficulty. Perhaps therefore, the main reason Huayna Potos\u00ed has been referred to as the easiest 6,000 m climb is that the elevation gain from trailhead to summit is less than 1,400 m; with easy access from La Paz. Since La Paz is at 3,640 m, climbers have an easier time acclimatizing."

It was the tenth race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 51st French Grand Prix as part of the series. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher won the 72-lap race starting from second position. Ralf Schumacher finished second for the Williams team with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari.\nRalf Schumacher led the opening 23 laps before he made his first pit stop and Michael Schumacher assumed the lead after the first round of pit stops. His nearest championship rival David Coulthard of the McLaren outfit served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 32 for an earlier transgression of speeding at the pit lane exit. Michael Schumacher pulled away from the slower car of Ralf Schumacher who baulked his teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, until his second pit stop on the 44th lap. Montoya led laps 46 to 50 before he ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, who maintained it to take his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career.\nThe result enabled Michael Schumacher to increase his Drivers' Championship lead over Coulthard in second to 31 points. Ralf Schumacher's second-place finish moved him past Barrichello for third. Although he retired from the event, Montoya kept fifth. Ferrari further extended their Constructors' Championship advantage to 52 points over the McLaren team in second.

This would create a disk of electrons over the United States that would overload the electronics on the Soviet warheads as they descended. It was also possible to use the effect to blind Soviet radars, meaning that any Soviet missile-based ABM system would be unable to attack the US counterstrike.\nThe tests demonstrated that the effect did occur, but that it dissipated too rapidly to be very effective.

Among local people today, \"Craigavon\" refers to the area between the two towns. It is built beside a pair of artificial lakes and is made up of a large residential area (Brownlow), a second smaller one (Mandeville), plus a central area (Highfield) that includes a substantial shopping centre, a courthouse and the district council headquarters. The area around the lakes is a public park and wildlife haven made up of woodland with walking trails. There is also a watersports centre, golf course and ski slope in the area. In most of Craigavon, motor vehicles are completely separated from pedestrians, and roundabouts are used extensively. It hosted the headquarters of the former Craigavon Borough Council.\nCraigavon sometimes refers to the much larger Craigavon Urban Area, a name used by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, which includes Craigavon, Lurgan, Portadown and Aghacommon."

Bodelschwinghsche Anstalten Bethel) is a diaconal (i.e. Protestant charitable) psychiatric hospital in Bethel, formerly a town, today a neighbourhood of Bielefeld, Germany.\n\nThe healthcare foundation was established in 1867 as Evangelische Heil- und Pflegeanstalt f\u00fcr Epileptische (Protestant institute of healing and care for epileptics) in Gadderbaum, today a locality of Bielefeld. In 1872 Pastor Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Senior, a proponent of the inner mission within the then Evangelical State Church in Prussia became its director. He massively strengthened and extended the institution, with more premises also for the poor and at other locations, and renamed it after Bethel in 1874. The name Bethel was also started being used for the neighbourhood, which developed outside the hospital. Later Bodelschwingh's name was compounded to the institution's name. In 1910 Bodelschwingh, Senior, died and the leadership passed on to his son Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Junior, who led the institution until his death in 1946.The institution is notable for its resistance against the Nazi Germany era. In August 1933, some six months after Hitler had become Reich Chancellor, Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, met with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and a few others to draft a new confession of faith, clarifying the grounds for resisting the Nazification of Germany, the Bethel Confession Betheler_Bekenntnis. The resulting document, the Barmen Declaration, was an early form of resistance to Hitler, a rejection of Christian anti-Judaism and racist anti-Semitism, though in practical terms it did nothing to impede the Nazis. During the course of the T-4 Euthanasia Program, which ran in 1940 and 1941 and was aimed at exterminating physically and mentally disabled people, the staff at the institution were mainly in opposition to that crime of the National Socialist party. In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the gassing of all mental patients. The director of the hospital, pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, resisted.\n\"You can put me into a concentration camp if you want, that is your affair.  But as long as I am free, you do not touch one of my patients.  I cannot change to fit the times or the wishes of the F\u00fchrer.  I stand under orders from our Lord Jesus Christ.\" - Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior Parts of the hospitals were destroyed in a British Royal Air Force air raid in 1940. In religious respect the Bethel Institution is related to the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, the Westphalian regional successor of the old-Prussian Church. In 1946 Bodelschwingh, Junior, died and Friedrich von Bodelschwingh (1902\u20131977), nephew of Bodelschwingh, Junior, and grandson of the Senior, started managing the part of the Bethel Institution located at Gadderbaum, serving as the general director of all the Bethel Institutions between 1959 and 1969. The Bethel Institution is currently still being used as a mental hospital."

It is in the Mahakoshal region in the geographic center of India.Many ancient temples can be found here. Near to Barman town is Rajmarg national highway.\nBarman is surrounded by Bitli ki pahadi, one of the major hills in Narsinghpur district.\nBarman is education center for surrounding villagers.\nBarman is situated 15 km from a small Town called Kareli. A square has been named as \"Barman Chowk\" in Kareli.\nBarman is the holy place,Barman has two main ghat- one is the bramhan ghat and other is retghat. In retghat every year a fair is organised in which thousands of people come from all over India\"\"cn\"\". The junction of the Narmada and Warahi rivers at Brahman is a sacred place and a large fair is held here in January. A number of temples have been constructed at Barmhan, and fine flights of steps leading up from the Narmada on the northern bank.The large temple on the southern bank of the river is called Rani Durgavati's, as it is supposed to have been built by the famous queen of the Gond-Rajput dynasty of Mandla. Another temple on this side is called the Pisanhari's, as it is supposed to have been built by a corn-grinder out of her small earnings. Another important temple is that of Lakshmi Narayan. At the top of the steps on the northern bank is a great gateway called the Hathi Darwaza, as elephants can pass through it. This was built by the Lodhi malguzar of Umaria. There are several temples on this side, the principal ones being the Bairagi's temple, built by a well-known Bairagi of Indore, and a temple of Rama and Lakshman with a large pillar of stone in front, on which are depicted the past and future Avatars of Vishnu. Nearly opposite to Barmhan there is an island in the Nerbudda, and at this place five kunds or small tanks are shown which are supposed to have been used by the Pandava brothers during their sojourn at Barmhan. There is also a foot-print of Bhima. The island contains a copper mine which was formerly worked by the Nerbudda Coal and Iron Company,but was abandoned as unprofitable. The fair is held in January and lasts for a month, the shops and booths being located in the bed of the Nerbudda. The attendance is heavy on the principal day of the festival of Til Sankrant. It is a very old fair and was formerly of great importance, as it was the annual occasion for the purchase of cloth, household utensils and other important commodities for the whole District. The merchandise brought to Barmhan in 1864 was estimated by the Deputy Commissioner to be worth more than 6 lakhs of rupees, of which more than half found a sale. The principal article of trade was English cloth of which two lakhs worth were received. Next to this lac ornaments and brass and copper utensils were the commonest goods. In 1892 the value of goods brought was Rs. 2-37 lakhs and that of the sales Rs. 1-57 lakhs. The total attendance is said to have been 450,000. In 1903-04 the total number of shops was 253, most of them being for the sale of cloth, metal vessels and utensils, and provisions. Statistics of the sales of produce are not available. An agricultural and cattle show is now also held and prizes aredistributed by the District authorities. The village of Barmhan is held revenue-free for the support of the temple of Lakshmi Narayan.[1]"

It was one of the four original coasters at Canada's Wonderland.The ride is built at the east end of the park in the Medieval Faire section. It is located adjacent to the parking lot, so it is one of the first coasters that is seen. The coaster has a green and yellow track with purple support poles. Since the removal of Drachen Fire from Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Dragon Fyre is also the only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counterclockwise-turning corkscrews.Dragon Fyre was designed to operate with three trains, which is made evident by the fact that the ride has a set of safety brakes following the corkscrews and before the helix. However, due to the ride's short duration, it would be very difficult for the ride staff to load a train in the station without having one train stop in the middle of the ride. Because of this, Dragon Fyre never used its third train. In 1987, the third train was modified for use on The Bat."

Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in October 2010 and in February 2012 sold the building and its adjacent campus to the Diocese of Orange for use as the diocese's new cathedral.

        "content": "Zamindawar is a historical region of Afghanistan. It is a very large and fertile valley the main sources for irrigation is the Helmand River. Zamindawar is located in the greater territory of northern Helmand and encompasses the approximate area of modern-day Baghran, Musa Qala, Naw Zad, Kajaki and Sangin districts. It was a district of hills, and of wide, well populated, and fertile valleys watered by important tributaries of the Helmand. The principal town was Musa Qala, which stands on the banks of a river of the same name, about 60 km north of the city of Grishk.This region was headquarters to the Durrani Pashtun tribe of the Alizai. The region is also home to Nurzai, Barakzai and Alakozai tribes, as well as other Durrani tribes and Kuchis. It was from Zamindawar that much of the strength of the force which besieged Kandahar under Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1880 was derived; and it was the Zamindawar contingent of tribesmen who so nearly defeated Sir Donald Stewart's force at the Battle of Ahmed Khel previously. The control of Zamindawar was regarded by the British-Indian forces as the key to the position for safeguarding the route between Herat and Kandahar during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.Zunbils ruled Zamindawar before Islamization of the area. The title Zunbil can be traced back to the Middle-Persian original Z\u016bn-d\u0101tbar, \"Zun the Justice-giver\". The geographical name Zamindawar would also reflect this, from Middle-Persian Zamin-i d\u0101tbar (Land of the Justice-giver)."

The epicenter was near the town of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Ouest department, approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.\nBy 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000, although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. Haiti's history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster.The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, H\u00e9di Annabi.Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called \"Hope for Haiti Now,\" raising US$58 million by the next day. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in mass graves.As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors."

It rises in central York County and flows generally south past North Berwick and joins the tidal part of the Salmon Falls River at South Berwick.\nThe native Newichawannock band of Abenaki called it the Asbenbedick. In July 1634, William Chadbourne, James Wall and John Goddard arrived from England aboard the ship Pied Cow with a commission to build a sawmill and gristmill  at the river's Assabumbadoc Falls.   The sawmill they built, thought to be the first over-shot water-powered site in America, was located in the \"Rocky Gorge\" below today's Brattle Street bridge.  Their sawmill was rebuilt with up to 20 saws on what was then the \"Little River\" in 1651 by Richard Leader, an engineer granted exclusive right to the water power. It was thereafter called the \"Great mill workes,\" from which the Great Works River derives its present name."

The university relocated to Szeged in 1921, making it one of the oldest research universities in Hungary. It went through numerous changes throughout the 20th century and was eventually divided into distinct independent universities.\nThe current University of Szeged was formed in 2000 and is made up of twelve constituent faculties and nineteen doctoral schools, which consist of a range of departments and research groups. Each faculty functions autonomously. In addition to these, the university also operates the Health Centre of the University of Szeged, an extensive teaching hospital responsible for public regional healthcare, and three laboratory schools, which combine public education and teacher training responsibilities. The faculties and associated buildings do not form one single campus, as the buildings are scattered around downtown Szeged, although the Health Centre and the buildings of the Department of Arts are adjacent to each other. Being part of the Bologna zone, most majors are divided into a Bachelor's and Master's and PhD programmes, but the so-called one tyre-master (undivided) programmes are also.The university also operates the Klebelsberg Library, the largest university library in Central Europe, and six university presses. In the fiscal year of 2014, the university had an operating budget of US$220 million. The University of Szeged has educated a large number of notable alumni, including Nobel laureates Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi and Katalin Karik\u00f3, political scientist Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3, and poets Attila J\u00f3zsef and Gyula Juh\u00e1sz."

Founded in 2003 by then 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. The company claimed that it had devised blood tests that required very small amounts of blood and that could be performed rapidly and accurately, all using compact automated devices that the company had developed. These claims were proven to be false.A turning point came in 2015, when medical research professor John Ioannidis, and later professor of clinical biochemistry Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos's technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. By June 2016, Forbes estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to \"nothing\". After several years of struggle, lawsuits, and sanctions from CMS, what remained of the company was dissolved in September 2018.Theranos, Holmes and former company president Sunny Balwani were charged with fraud by the SEC in 2018. Holmes and Balwani were also charged with wire fraud and conspiracy, with Holmes being found guilty on four counts in January 2022 and sentenced that November to 11 years and 3 months in prison. Balwani was convicted on all 12 counts brought against him in July 2022, and in December 2022 was sentenced to 12 years and 11 months in prison and 3 years of probation."

In March 2016, it dissolved to merge into the Solidarity Movement.The two predecessors were considered the most nationalist, anti-Turkish and anti-immigrant among Greek Cypriot parties. Evroko had a hard-line stance on the Cyprus problem, rejecting any compromise with Turkey or the Turkish-dominated Northern Cyprus, as proposed by the Annan Plan for Cyprus. It supported European integration and maintaining Greek influence in Cyprus. The party supported free market economic policies similar to that of Democratic Rally and the Democratic Party. In electoral campaigns, Evroko stirred up xenophobic ressentiments, suggesting that Greek Cypriots would become a minority in their own country, endangered by criminal, illegal aliens who would steal their jobs.The party was a member of the European Democratic Party.\nIn the elections of 21 May 2006, the party won 5.8 percent and 3 out of 56 seats. In the 2009 European parliament election, Evroko won 4.12% of votes. In the 2011 legislative elections the party won 3.88 percent and 2 out of 56 seats. In 2013, Nikos Koutsou, one of the two members of parliament, left the party to become an independent due to disagreement. For the European Parliament election, 2014, the party formed an alliance with the Democratic Rally (DISY). Both seats won by the alliance went to DISY members."

Except for small areas, the Dresden Heath is considered part of the western Lusatian Highlands and, consequently, is one of the westernmost parts of the Sudetes. Though the rocky subsoil of the forest was raised during the tectonic formation of the Dresden Basin, the mixed woodland of the heath is largely characterized by dune-like sand deposits of the Wolstonian Stage and Elster glaciation. The proximity of the Dresden Heath to the centre of Dresden led to its use as a princely hunting ground, as well as its cultivation and cultural development."

It is an independent judicial body, with around 600 employees. Its current President is Kay Scheller.\n\nThe institution is a supreme federal authority only as far as it administers internal tasks such as personnel affairs, management of buildings or clearance of travel expenses and the like.\nProcessing its core duties - auditing, reporting and counseling as external financial controllers - it is not part of the executive branch of Germany, but is positioned beyond the three classical constitutional powers.\nThe Bundesrechnungshof is not subordinated to the federal government.\nEven the legislative (parliament) cannot instruct it. At best, the parliament can ask the authority to audit certain issues.\nFrom the third power, justice, it differs firstly by freely choosing the subject matters it intends to audit and secondly by not delivering legally binding rules, but by issuing recommendations.\nBundesrechnungshof\u2019s exact placement within a classical system of the division of powers is disputed."

        "content": "Like other parts of the world, climate in Idaho has changed dramatically over the geologic history of the Earth.  Paleo-climatic records give some indication of these changes.  The longest instrumented records of climate in Idaho extend back to the late 1800s.  Concern over human induced climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture and industry, are driving research efforts across the state at university, state, and federals levels to understand what the implications of climate change could be in Idaho.\nIn the big picture of greenhouse gas emissions, Idaho emits the least carbon dioxide per person of the United States, less than 23,000 pounds a year. It relies mostly on nonpolluting hydroelectric power from its rivers.Like other parts of the world, Idaho has seen significant temperature increases, especially in the last several decades.  From 1971 to 2005 the average annual observed temperature in the Snake River Plain, located in southern Idaho, has increased by 1.4 degrees Celsius based on data from 10 climate stations (Dubois, Ashton, Oakely, Pocatello, Aberdeen, Hazelton, Jerome, Boise, Nampa, and Payette).  Statistically the increasing temperature trends are most significant in the months of January, March, and April.  While precipitation has generally increased since the early 1900s, the high variability in precipitation makes the identification of precipitation trends statistically difficult.\nOver the course of the 21st century, climate in Idaho is expected to experience additional changes due both to 'natural' climate variability and due to feedbacks related to the interaction between climate variability and increasing greenhouse gases. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre\u2019s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in Idaho could increase by 5 \u00b0F (2.8 \u00b0C) (with a range of 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) to 9 \u00b0F (5.0 \u00b0C)) in winter and summer and 4 \u00b0F (2.2 \u00b0C) (with a range of 2 \u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C) to 7 \u00b0F (3.9 \u00b0C)) in spring and fall. Precipitation is estimated to change little in summer, to increase by 10% in spring and fall (with a range of 5-20%), and to increase by 20% in winter (with a range of 10-40%). Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The amount of precipitation on extreme wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible."

It is best known for its professional men's association football team, which plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Bayern is the most successful club in German football history, having won a record 33 national titles, including eleven consecutively since 2013, and 20 national cups, along with numerous European honours.\nBayern Munich was founded in 1900 by eleven players, led by Franz John. Although Bayern won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success in the mid-1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, they won the European Cup three consecutive times (1974\u20131976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the 2020 final as part of the Treble, after which it became the second European club to achieve the feat twice. Bayern has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally, and the only German club to have won both international titles. Bayern players have accumulated five Ballon d'Or awards, two The Best FIFA Men's Player awards, four European Golden Shoe and three UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards, including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.\nBy winning the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, Bayern Munich became only the second club to win the \"sextuple\" (winning the League, Cup, and Champions League in one season followed by the Domestic Supercup, UEFA Supercup and Club World Cup in the next season), or all trophies that a club competes for in a given calendar year. Bayern Munich are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, the only German club to achieve that. As of May 2023, Bayern Munich are ranked second in UEFA club rankings. The club has traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg.\nSince the beginning of the 2005\u201306 season, Bayern has played its home games at the Allianz Arena. Previously, the team had played at Munich's Olympiastadion for 33 years. The team colours are red and white, and the crest shows the white and blue flag of Bavaria. In terms of revenue, Bayern Munich is the largest sports club in Germany and the third highest-earning football club in the world, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, with a value of \u20ac634.1 million in 2021.

        "content": "Anogeia (\u0391\u03bd\u03ce\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) is a municipality in the Rethymno regional unit, Crete, Greece. The municipality has an area of 102.632 km2 (39.626 sq mi). Population 2,379 (2011).\nWhen exactly Anogeia was founded and by whom, is not accurately known. Many believe that the original settlement was founded by villagers from the village Axos, which is west of Anogia, where the Minoan city Oaxos was.\nAccording to a legend, a shepherd from Axos found one day on one of the slopes of Psiloreitis an icon depicting Saint John the Baptist. Pious as he was, he picked it up carefully, wrapped it in a towel, took it to his home and placed it there alongside the other icons. On the following day he was astonished to find out that the icon had disappeared. Terrified, he returned to the place he had found it the previous day, where he was exhilarated to discover the icon in the exact same place. This inexplicable phenomenon was considered to be an order from the heavens, to build there a temple dedicated to Saint John the Baptist.\nThe church of Saint John seems to be the first building of the settlement, which later came to be known as \"Anogia\". Within the temple of Saint John are remains of Byzantine drawings on the walls, which date to the 11th century.\nThe historian Stelios Spanakis, summarily provides geographical, as well as historical information about Anogia,: \u201cAnogia is a town \u2013municipality in the Mylopotamos Province of the Prefecture of Rethymno. In the 1981 census it numbered 2.449 citizens. It is in the northern reaches of Psiloreitis, at an altitude of 700-790 meters. When in 1182 Crete was divided among the 12 Young Princes of Byzantium, Anogia were given to the family of Fokas. Anogia are referred to by Venetian and Greek scholars and historians as Anogia, or Anoia. In 1593 it was already a significant settlement, numbering 911 citizens. Anogia are referred to as a revolutionary place during the years of Turkish occupation. In 1822, when the Anogians were fighting the Turks in Messara, Serif Pasha found the village empty and put it to the torch. In November 1866, during the Great Cretan Revolt, Resit Pasha tried to capture Anogia, but he was repulsed by the Anogians and other villagers from Mylopotamos.\u201d  This tradition continued during the German occupation and in August 1944 the village was once again razed to the ground in reprisal for the local's participation in the resistance.\nThe living conditions of the people of Anogia, as well as those of other mountain villages in Crete, were extremely difficult. Anogians of old times were mainly shepherds, goatherds and not so many of them were farmers. The barren soil, the harsh winters, the frequent revolts and the constant purges from the conquerors contributed to the primitive living conditions, to the great poverty and the lack of even the most basic of comforts.\nThe French historian Victor Berard (1897) during his journeys in Crete, dedicated but a few lines for the village of Anogia, where with a raw and laconic way describes the hopeless living conditions of the time: \u201cThe village Anogia, resembles the outposts on the remote peaks of old, where men and animals live together in miserable hovels\u201d.\nThe Italian Vittorio Simonelli who visited Crete in 1893, was much more generous in his descriptions. First, he was put up at a \u201ctolerable inn\u201d. As for the villagers themselves, both men and women, made a great impression on him, when on a Sunday he saw them going to the church. He wrote: \u201cAnogian women are beautiful, with red cheeks and faces that are lit up by eyes black and shiny, like agate. Their traditional clothing, accentuates the health and beauty that characterize the ancient Cretan archetype. The men are also handsome, being tall, lean, and easy in their movement, proud, but without even a trace of ferociousness\u201d.\nIn recent years, the Yakinthia (Hyacinthia) cultural festival is held at an altitude of 1200m in the Nida Plateau, south of Anogeia. The festival is held annually every July and focuses on the Cretan folk tradition and its blending with the traditions of Greece and the Mediterranean."
