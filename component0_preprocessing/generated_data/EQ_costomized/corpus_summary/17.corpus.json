        "content": "Venice ( ;  ;  or  ) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118\u00a0small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400\u00a0bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, 258,685\u00a0people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the historical city of Venice (centro storico). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6\u00a0million. The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th\u00a0century\u00a0BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important center of commerce\u2014especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial center, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th\u00a0century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire, until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866, following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence. Venice has been known as \"La Dominante\", \"La Serenissima\", \"Queen of the Adriatic\", \"City of Water\", \"City of Masks\", \"City of Bridges\", \"The Floating City\", and \"City of Canals\". The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and artwork. Venice is known for several important artistic movements\u2014especially during the Renaissance period\u2014and has played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi. Although the city is facing some challenges (including an excessive number of tourists and problems caused by pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing too close to buildings), Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city in the world. It has been described by the Times Online as one of Europe's most romantic cities and by The New York Times as \"undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man\"."

        "title": "Embargo Act of 1807_Summary",
        "content": "The Embargo Act of 1807 was a general trade embargo on all foreign nations that was enacted by the United States Congress. As a successor or replacement law for the 1806 Non-importation Act and passed as the Napoleonic Wars continued, it represented an escalation of attempts to coerce Britain to stop any impressment of American sailors and to respect American sovereignty and neutrality but also attempted to pressure France and other nations in the pursuit of general diplomatic and economic leverage. In the first decade of the 19th century, American shipping grew. During the Napoleonic Wars, rival nations Britain and France targeted neutral American shipping as a means to disrupt the trade of the other nation. American merchantmen who were trading with \"enemy nations\" were seized as contraband of war by European navies. The British Royal Navy had impressed American sailors who had either been British-born or previously serving on British ships, even if they now claimed to be American citizens with American papers. Incidents such as the Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair outraged Americans. Congress imposed the embargo in direct response to these events. President Thomas Jefferson acted with restraint, weighed public support for retaliation, and recognized that the United States was militarily far weaker than either Britain or France. He recommended that Congress respond with commercial warfare, a policy that appealed to Jefferson both for being experimental and for foreseeably harming his domestic political opponents more than his allies, whatever its effect on the European belligerents. The 10th Congress was controlled by his allies and agreed to the Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 1807. The embargo proved to be a complete failure. It failed to improve the American diplomatic position, highlighted American weakness and lack of leverage, significantly (and only) damaged the American economy, and sharply increased domestic political tensions. Both widespread evasion of the embargo and loopholes in the legislation reduced its impact on its targets. British commercial shipping, which already dominated global trade, was successfully adapting to Napoleon's Continental System by pursuing new markets, particularly in the restive Spanish and  Portuguese colonies in South America. Thus, British merchants were well-positioned to grow at American expense when the embargo sharply reduced American trade activity. The embargo undermined American unity by provoking bitter protests, particularly in New England commercial centers. Support for the declining Federalist Party, which intensely opposed Jefferson, temporarily rebounded and drove electoral gains in 1808 (Senate and House). The embargo simultaneously undermined Americans' faith that their government could execute laws fairly and strengthened the European perception that the republican form of government was inept and ineffectual. Replacement legislation for the ineffective embargo was enacted on March 1, 1809, in the last days of Jefferson's presidency. Tensions with Britain continued to grow and eventually led to the War of 1812."

        "content": "The Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) was a United States federal law of the New Deal era designed to boost agricultural prices by reducing surpluses. The government bought livestock for slaughter and paid farmers subsidies not to plant on part of their land. The money for these subsidies was generated through an exclusive tax on companies which processed farm products. The Act created a new agency, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to oversee the distribution of the subsidies. The Agriculture Marketing Act, which established the Federal Farm Board in 1929, was seen as an important precursor to this act. The AAA, along with other New Deal programs, represented the federal government's first substantial effort to address economic welfare in the United States."

According to the U.S Census estimates of 2018, the city had a population of 3,162. The city was incorporated in 1903 and is the self professed \"Home of the Manatee\". Crystal River Preserve State Park is located nearby, and Crystal River Archaeological State Park is located in the city's northwest side. Crystal River is at the heart of the Nature Coast of Florida. The city is situated around Kings Bay, which is spring-fed so it keeps a constant  temperature year round. A cluster of 50 springs designated as a first-magnitude system feeds Kings Bay. A first-magnitude system discharges 100 cubic feet or more of water per second, which equals about 64 million gallons of water per day. Because of this discharge amount, the Crystal River Springs group is the second largest springs group in Florida, the first being Wakulla Springs in Wakulla County near Tallahassee. Kings Bay can be home to over 400 manatees during the winter when the water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico cools, and is the only place in the United States where people can legally interact with them in their natural conditions without that interaction being viewed as harassment by law enforcement agencies. Tourism based on watching and swimming with manatee is the fastest growing contribution to the local economy. In 2005 there was a movement to dissolve the city which did not succeed, and the city has since grown by annexation."

The local chamber of commerce has described the city as the \"Seafood Capitol of Alabama\" for packaging seafood from hundreds of fishing boats. Bayou La Batre was founded in 1786, when French-born Joseph Bouzage (Bosarge) [1733-1795] was awarded a  Spanish land grant on the West Bank of the bayou (see history below). The modern City of Bayou La Batre was incorporated in 1955. Bayou La Batre was featured in the 1994 film Forrest Gump and the book upon which it is based. In April 2005, Disney Studios launched a secretly built pirate ship, the Black Pearl, out of Bayou La Batre for filming sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Bayou La Batre's seafood industry also serves as a centerpiece for the History channel's reality documentary series Big Shrimpin'. On August 29, 2005, the area was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, which produced the largest storm surge ever recorded in the area, reaching nearly  and pushing many shrimp boats and the cargo ship M/V Caribbean Clipper onto shore."

Continental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era that provided very fine, almost fancy, service against the larger majors in important point-to-point markets, the largest of which was Chicago/Los Angeles. However, deregulation in 1978 changed the competitive landscape and realities, as noted by Smithsonian Airline Historian R. E. G. Davies, \"Unfortunately, the policies that had been successful for more than forty years under (Robert) Six's cavalier style of management were suddenly laid bare as the cold winds of airline deregulation changed all the rules\u2014specifically, the balance between revenues and expenditures.\" In 1981, Texas International Airlines acquired a controlling interest in Continental.  The companies were merged in 1982, moved to Houston, and grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial and labor issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States. The airline was acquired by UAL Corporation, the parent company of United Airlines, in an all-stock transaction on October 1, 2010. Continental's shareholders received 1.05 per share in United stock for each Continental share they owned. Upon completion of the acquisition, UAL Corporation changed their name to United Continental Holdings. During the integration period, each airline ran a separate operation under the direction of a combined leadership team, based in Chicago. The integration was completed on March 3, 2012. Although the merged airline retained the United name, it uses Continental's operating certificate and livery. On June 27, 2019, United changed its parent company name from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings."

The tests were performed by the Defense Nuclear Agency. The tests were to study the Christofilos effect, which suggested it was possible to defend against Soviet nuclear missiles by exploding a small number of nuclear bombs high over the South Pacific. This would create a disk of electrons over the United States that would fry the electronics on the Soviet warheads as they descended. It was also possible to use the effect to blind Soviet radars, meaning that any Soviet missile-based ABM system would be unable to attack the US counterstrike. The tests demonstrated that the effect did indeed occur, but also revealed that it dissipated too rapidly to be very effective. Papers on the topic were published the next year, focusing on the events as purely scientific endeavors."

While Napoleon's army mauled an Allied army under Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher, the main Allied army commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, advanced to a position dangerously close to Paris. Gathering up his outnumbered forces, Napoleon rushed his soldiers south to deal with Schwarzenberg. Hearing of the approach of the French emperor, the Allied commander ordered a withdrawal, but 17 February saw his rear guards overrun or brushed aside. Ordered to hold Montereau until nightfall on the 18th, the Crown Prince of W\u00fcrttemberg posted a strong force on the north bank of the Seine River. All morning and past noon, the Allies stoutly held off a series of French attacks. However, under increasing French pressure, the Crown Prince's lines buckled in the afternoon and his troops ran for the single bridge to their rear. Brilliantly led by Pierre Claude Pajol, the French cavalry got among the fugitives, captured the spans over both the Seine and Yonne Rivers and seized Montereau. The Allied force suffered heavy losses and the defeat confirmed Schwarzenberg's decision to continue the retreat to Troyes."

They were originally designated by number and eventually became Logan, Cleveland, Oklahoma, Canadian, Kingfisher, Payne, and Beaver counties. The Land Run of 1893 led to the addition of Kay, Grant, Woods, Garfield, Noble, and Pawnee counties.

Ravenna Creek used to drain Green Lake into Lake Washington's Union Bay, but urban development and the lowering of the two lakes in 1911 and 1916 resulted in the disappearance of the creekbed between Green Lake and Cowen Park and between Ravenna Park and Union Bay. Ravenna Creek's current source is a wetland in the northwest corner of Cowen Park, at NE 62nd Street and Brooklyn Avenue NE. It is also fed by springs throughout Ravenna Park, and is joined there by a second branch which begins near the intersection of NE 65th Street and 23rd Avenue NE. Until 2006, the creek ended at a sewer grate where the park's trail system opened into a soccer field. A daylighting project completed in May 2006 disconnected the creek from the sewer system and extended its bed  towards the southeast corner of Ravenna Park, at which point it enters a pipeline. This pipeline, which runs southward along 25th Avenue NE to the NE 45th Street viaduct, empties into University Slough, thereby reconnecting Ravenna Creek to Lake Washington.

Established as the Jesuit Academy of Kolozsv\u00e1r in present-day Cluj-Napoca in 1581, the institution was re-established as a university in 1872 by Emperor Franz Joseph I. The university relocated to Szeged in 1921, making it one of the oldest research universities in Hungary. It went through numerous changes throughout the 20th century and was eventually divided into distinct independent universities. The current University of Szeged was formed in 2000 and is made up of twelve constituent faculties and nineteen doctoral schools, which consist of a range of departments and research groups. Each faculty functions autonomously. In addition to these, the university also operates the Health Centre of the University of Szeged, an extensive teaching hospital responsible for public regional healthcare, and three laboratory schools, which combine public education and teacher training responsibilities. The faculties and associated buildings do not form one single campus, as the buildings are scattered around downtown Szeged, although the Health Centre and the buildings of the Department of Arts are adjacent to each other. Being part of the Bologna zone, most majors are divided into a Bachelor's and Master's and PhD programmes, but the so called one tyre-master (undivided) programmes are also. The university also operates the Klebelsberg Library, the largest university library in Central Europe, and six university presses. In the fiscal year of 2014, the university had an operating budget of US$220 million. The University of Szeged has educated a large number of notable alumni, including Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi, political scientist Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3, poets Attila J\u00f3zsef and Gyula Juh\u00e1sz and biochemist Katalin Karik\u00f3.

It is the equivalent of what many cities call their downtown, although in New Orleans \"downtown\" or \"down town\" was historically used to mean all portions of the city downriver from Canal Street (in the direction of flow of the Mississippi River). In recent decades, however, use of the catch-all \"downtown\" adjective to describe neighborhoods downriver from Canal Street has largely ceased, having been replaced in usage by individual neighborhood names (such as Bywater). Originally developed as the largely-residential Faubourg Ste.

Ralf Schumacher led the opening 23 laps before he made his first pit stop and Michael Schumacher assumed the lead after the first round of pit stops. His nearest championship rival David Coulthard of the McLaren outfit served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 32 for an earlier transgression of speeding at the pit lane exit. Michael Schumacher pulled away from the slower car of Ralf Schumacher who baulked his teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, until his second pit stop on the 44th lap. Montoya led laps 46 to 50 before he ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, who maintained it to take his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career. The result enabled Michael Schumacher to increase his Drivers' Championship lead over Coulthard in second to 31 points. Ralf Schumacher's second-place finish moved him past Barrichello for third.

The Belize river valley is largely  tropical rain forest. Also known as the Old River, the Belize River begins where the Mopan River and Macal River join just east of San Ignacio, Belize (). The Belize River \u2013 Mopan River Catchment contains over 45\u00a0percent of the population of Belize. The Belize River, in spite of 78 runs or rapids, is passable via the Mopan to the Guatemalan border. It served as the main artery of commerce and communication between the interior and the coast until well into the twentieth century, and has long been associated with forestry, of logwood (for dye) and of mahogany which survives in small stands. Early on, loggers using the river encountered the Maya and had conflicts with them and with the Spaniards. In 1807 there was a request for \u201carms and ammunitions\u201d for the loggers. In the late 1820s, the Methodist minister Thomas Wilkinson found three to four thousand men working at camps most of the year.  By the late 19th century there were over 130 small settlements along the river. Burrell Boom just above Belize Town served as a catch-point for logs. Today the Belize River is a vital source of drinking water and other domestic use for local people living along the river; however, water quality is degraded from sediment, nutrient loading, pesticides and other toxins.  The major source of degradation is the extensive deforestation in the upper reaches of the Mopan River and non-sustainable agriculture.  Karper and Boles have asserted: \"The greater Mopan/Belize River Catchment provides a prime example of a watershed under stress from extensive non-sustainable agricultural practices that have occurred within the region over the past three decades.\" Traditional slash and burn agricultural practices also contribute to watershed degradation."

It was a district of hills, and of wide, well populated, and fertile valleys watered by important tributaries of the Helmand. The principal town was Musa Qala, which stands on the banks of a river of the same name, about 60 km north of the city of Grishk. This region was headquarters to the Durrani Pashtun tribe of the Alizai. The region is also home to Nurzai, Barakzai and Alakozai tribes, as well as other Durrani tribes and Kuchis. It was from Zamindawar that much of the strength of the force which besieged Kandahar under Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1880 was derived; and it was the Zamindawar contingent of tribesmen who so nearly defeated Sir Donald Stewart's force at the Battle of Ahmed Khel previously. The control of Zamindawar was regarded by the British-Indian forces as the key to the position for safeguarding the route between Herat and Kandahar during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Zunbils ruled Zamindawar before Islamization of the area. The title Zunbil can be traced back to the Middle-Persian original Z\u016bn-d\u0101tbar, \"Zun the Justice-giver\".

        "content": "The Bethel Foundation, officially the Bodelschwingh Foundation Bethel ( as of 2009, previously v. Bodelschwinghsche Anstalten Bethel) is a diaconal (i.e. Protestant charitable) psychiatric hospital in Bethel, formerly a town, today a neighbourhood of Bielefeld, Germany. The healthcare foundation was established in 1867 as Evangelische Heil- und Pflegeanstalt f\u00fcr Epileptische (Protestant institute of healing and care for epileptics) in Gadderbaum, today a locality of Bielefeld. In 1872 Pastor Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Senior, a proponent of the inner mission within the then Evangelical State Church in Prussia became its director. He massively strengthened and extended the institution, with more premises also for the poor and at other locations, and renamed it after Bethel in 1874. The name Bethel was also started being used for the neighbourhood, which developed outside the hospital. Later Bodelschwingh's name was compounded to the institution's name. In 1910 Bodelschwingh, Senior, died and the leadership passed on to his son Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Junior, who led the institution until his death in 1946. The institution is notable for its resistance against the Nazi Germany era. In August 1933, some six months after Hitler had become Reich Chancellor, Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, met with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and a few others to draft a new confession of faith, clarifying the grounds for resisting the Nazification of Germany. The resulting document, called the Bethel Declaration (Betheler Bekenntnis), was an early form of resistance to Hitler, a rejection of Christian anti-Judaism and racist anti-Semitism, though in practical terms it did nothing to impede the Nazis. During the course of the T-4 Euthanasia Program, which ran in 1940 and 1941 and was aimed at exterminating physically and mentally disabled people, the staff at the institution were mainly in opposition to that crime of the National Socialist party. In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the gassing of all mental patients. The director of the hospital, pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, resisted. \"You can put me into a concentration camp if you want, that is your affair.  But as long as I am free, you do not touch one of my patients.  I cannot change to fit the times or the wishes of the F\u00fchrer.  I stand under orders from our Lord Jesus Christ.\" - Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior Parts of the hospitals were destroyed in a British Royal Air Force air raid in 1940. In religious respect the Bethel Institution is related to the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, the Westphalian regional successor of the old-Prussian Church. In 1946 Bodelschwingh, Junior, died and Friedrich von Bodelschwingh (1902\u20131977), nephew of Bodelschwingh, Junior, and grandson of the Senior, started managing the part of the Bethel Institution located at Gadderbaum, serving as the general director of all the Bethel Institutions between 1959 and 1969. The Bethel Institution is currently still being used as a mental hospital."

According to some accounts, this Paradise garden, imitating paradise or heaven, was furnished with all luxuries of life, even a rivulet of wine and was used to recruit Sabah's assassins. The recruit was drugged to simulate \"dying,\" only to later awaken in a garden and be served a sumptuous feast by virgins. The supplicant was then convinced he was in Heaven and that Sabah was a minion of the divinity and that all of his orders should be followed, even to death. The novel Firdaus-e-Bareen, written by Indian Muslim novelist Abdul Halim Sharar, gives a biographical account of Hussain, a youth lured and captured by Sabah's men and then forced into his assassination machinery.

After looking at sites in Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Austin, Wichita Falls and Midland, three sites were established in 1917 in the Fort Worth vicinity (known as the \"Flying Triangle.\"), those being Hicks Field (#1), Barron Field (#2), and Benbrook Field (#3). Canadians named the training complex Camp Taliaferro after Walter Taliaferro, a US aviator who had been killed in an accident.

Huayna Potos\u00ed is the closest high mountain to La Paz.  Surrounded by high mountains, it is roughly 15 miles due north of the city, which makes this mountain the most popular climb in Bolivia. The normal ascent route is a fairly straightforward glacier climb, with some crevasses and a steep climb to the summit. However, the other side of the mountain\u2014Huayna Potos\u00ed West Face\u2014is the biggest face in Bolivia. Several difficult snow and ice routes ascend this 1000 meter high face. The first ascent of the normal route was undertaken in 1919 by Germans Rudolf Dienst and Adolf Schulze. Some climbing books report this mountain as the \"easiest 6000er in the world\", but this claim is debatable. The easiest route entails an exposed ridge and sections of moderately steep ice, with a UIAA rating of PD. There are many 6000m mountains that are easier to climb in terms of technical difficulty. Perhaps therefore, the main reason Huayna Potos\u00ed has been referred to as the easiest 6000m climb is that the elevation gain from trailhead to summit is less than 1400 m; with easy access from La Paz. Since La Paz is at 3640 m, climbers have an easier time acclimatizing."

It was composed of ministers and laypeople who withdrew from the Methodist Episcopal Church because of disagreements regarding slavery, church government, and interpretations of the doctrine of entire sanctification, according to the  Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection, although later editions of the Discipline cite only the first two reasons. The first secessions in 1841 took place in Michigan although the new church group was formalized in Utica, New York. In November 1842, Orange Scott, La Roy Sunderland and J. Horton seceded from the Methodist Episcopal Church for reasons given in their publication of the True Wesleyan. The first general conference was held in Utica, NY, in October 1844. The Wesleyan Methodist Church fell into the category of Holiness Methodist Pacifists, as it opposed war as documented in its Book of Disciplines, which stated that the Gospel is in \"every way opposed to the practice of War in all its forms; and those customs which tend to foster and perpetuate war spirit, [are] inconsistent with the benevolent designs of the Christian religion.\"  They also cited tolerance of the Methodist Episcopal Church of \"so horrible a crime\" as slavery as a reason for their secession. The Wesleyan Methodist Church merged with the Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1968, and became known as The Wesleyan Church. Several conferences in both merging denominations refused to be a part of the merged church over differences about modesty and worldliness (some of the conferences did not permit their members to have television sets, and required the women to have uncut hair). One of the largest conferences which refused to join the merger was the Allegheny Conference with over 100 churches. It became the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection of Churches, and most of the churches are still known as Wesleyan Methodist. Other Wesleyan Methodists who dissented with the merger organized into the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches and the Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee."

It supported European integration and maintaining Greek influence in Cyprus. The party supported free market economic policies similar to that of Democratic Rally and the Democratic Party. In electoral campaigns, Evroko stirred up xenophobic ressentiments, suggesting that Greek Cypriots would become a minority in their own country, endangered by criminal, illegal aliens who would steal their jobs.

President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, ordering people of Japanese ancestry to be incarcerated in what were euphemistically called \"relocation centers\" like Topaz during World War II. Most of the people incarcerated at Topaz came from the Tanforan Assembly Center and previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. The camp was opened in September 1942 and closed in October 1945. The camp, approximately  west of Delta, Utah, consisted of , with a  main living area. Most internees lived in the main living area, though some lived off-site as agricultural and industrial laborers. The approximately 9,000 internees and staff made Topaz into the fifth-largest city in Utah at the time. The extreme temperature fluctuations of the arid area combined with uninsulated barracks made conditions very uncomfortable, even after the belated installation of pot-bellied stoves. The camp housed two elementary schools and a high school, a library, and some recreational facilities. Camp life was documented in a newspaper, Topaz Times, and in the literary publication Trek. Internees worked inside and outside the camp, mostly in agricultural labor. Many internees became notable artists. In the winter of 1942\u20131943, a loyalty questionnaire asked prisoners if they would declare their loyalty to the United States of America and if they would be willing to enlist. The questions were divisive, and prisoners who were considered \"disloyal\" because of their answers on the loyalty questionnaire were sent to the Tule Lake Segregation Camp. One internee, James Wakasa, was shot and killed for being too close to the camp's fence. Topaz prisoners held a large funeral and stopped working until administrators relaxed security. In 1983, Jane Beckwith founded the Topaz Museum Board. Topaz became a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2007. After many years of organizing, fundraising, and collecting information and artifacts, the Topaz Museum was built in Delta and debuted with a display of the art created at Topaz. Permanent exhibits, installed in 2017, chronicle the people who were interned there and tell their stories."

KIWA was founded in 1992 by progressive minded Korean activists who saw class as the basic contradiction of the immigrant communities  in Koreatown. It has since been involved in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest, campaigns to improve working conditions and immigrant worker empowerment in various Korean ethnic industries, the living wages campaign, and Koreatown's multi-ethnic community developments. KIWA is perhaps best known recently for its long campaign against Assi Market, the largest ethnic Korean-owned supermarket of the United States, located in Koreatown. Started in the late 1990s, KIWA demands that Assi management rehire dozens of fired Latino and Korean workers who were fired for trying to organize a trade union. Although initially staffed mostly by ethnic Koreans, KIWA grew to encompass Asian-Pacific American and Latino organizers and members. The Spanish language \"Alianza de trabajadores inmigrantes del Barrio Coreano\" had been in common use since the early 2000s; however the English language name was officially changed in March 2006 from Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates to Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance. The Korean language \"\ud55c\uc778\ub178\ub3d9\uc0c1\ub2f4\uc18c\" (Korean Worker's Center) has been changed to \ud55c\uc778\ud0c0\uc6b4 \ub178\ub3d9\uc5f0\ub300 to signify its geographical focus rather than on an ethnic group.

The monument is located within Deland Park along the Lake Michigan shoreline of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, which contains one of the larger Hmong communities in the United States. It was dedicated on July 15, 2006. Sheboygan was among the first United States cities to accept Hmong asylum seekers and immigrants in late 1976, after the victory of a communist government in Laos. The memorial is intended to honor and memorialize all the Hmong who fought against communism. It includes 24 panels dedicated to military personnel who were a part of the Hmong Secret Guerrilla Unit Army that fought against the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in the Secret War, as well as all civilian participants. The monument was vandalized in 2008. In June 2010, a painted centerpiece (pang dao) was added, consisting of a green circle with traditional white needlework. The United States did not acknowledge the Secret War until 1997, under the administration of President Bill Clinton, as a result of Hmong and Congressional pressure. In 2004, following several years of pressure from a coalition of U.S. conservatives and liberal human rights activists, the U.S. government reversed a policy of denying immigration to Hmong who had fled Laos in the 1990s for refugee camps in Thailand. In a major victory for the refugees, the US government recognized some 15,000 Hmong as asylum seekers and afforded them expedited U.S. immigration rights."

When exactly Anogeia was founded and by whom, is not accurately known. Many  believe that the original settlement was founded by villagers from the village Axos, which is west of Anogia, where the Minoan city Oaxos was. According to a legend, a shepherd from Axos found one day on one of the slopes of Psiloreitis an icon depicting Saint John the Baptist. Pious as he was, he picked it up carefully, wrapped it in a towel, took it to his home and placed it there alongside the other icons. On the following day he was astonished to find out that the icon had disappeared. Terrified, he returned to the place he had found it the previous day, where he was exhilarated to discover the icon in the exact same place. This inexplicable phenomenon was considered to be an order from the heavens, to build there a temple dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. The church of Saint John seems to be the first building of the settlement, which later came to be known as \"Anogia\". Within the temple of Saint John are remains of Byzantine drawings on the walls, which date to the 11th century. The historian Stelios Spanakis, summarily provides geographical, as well as historical information about Anogia,: \u201cAnogia is a town \u2013municipality in the Mylopotamos Province of the Prefecture of Rethymno. In the 1981 census it numbered 2.449 citizens. It is in the northern reaches of Psiloreitis, at an altitude of 700-790 meters. When in 1182 Crete was divided among the 12 Young Princes of Byzantium, Anogia were given to the family of Fokas. Anogia are referred to by Venetian and Greek scholars and historians as Anogia, or Anoia. In 1593 it was already a significant settlement, numbering 911 citizens. Anogia are referred to as a revolutionary place during the years of Turkish occupation. In 1822, when the Anogians were fighting the Turks in Messara, Serif Pasha found the village empty and put it to the torch. In November 1866, during the Great Cretan Revolt, Resit Pasha tried to capture Anogia, but he was repulsed by the Anogians and other villagers from Mylopotamos.\u201d  This tradition continued during the German occupation and in August 1944 the village was once again razed to the ground in reprisal for the local's participation in the resistance. The living conditions of the people of Anogia, as well as those of other mountain villages in Crete, were extremely difficult. Anogians of old times were mainly shepherds, goatherds and not so many of them were farmers. The barren soil, the harsh winters, the frequent revolts and the constant purges from the conquerors contributed to the primitive living conditions, to the great poverty and the lack of even the most basic of comforts. The French historian Victor Berard (1897) during his journeys in Crete, dedicated but a few lines for the village of Anogia, where with a raw and laconic way describes the hopeless living conditions of the time: \u201cThe village Anogia, resembles the outposts on the remote peaks of old, where men and animals live together in miserable hovels\u201d. The Italian Vittorio Simonelli who visited Crete in 1893, was much more generous in his descriptions. First, he was put up at a \u201ctolerable inn\u201d. As for the villagers themselves, both men and women, made a great impression on him, when on a Sunday he saw them going to the church. He wrote: \u201cAnogian women are beautiful, with red cheeks and faces that are lit up by eyes black and shiny, like agate. Their traditional clothing, accentuates the health and beauty that characterize the ancient Cretan archetype. The men are also handsome, being tall, lean, and easy in their movement, proud, but without even a trace of ferociousness\u201d. In recent years, the Yakinthia (Hyacinthia) cultural festival is held at an altitude of 1200m in the Nida Plateau, south of Anogeia. The festival is held annually every July and focuses on the Cretan folk tradition and its blending with the traditions of Greece and the Mediterranean."

The house was bought by the Bolivian explorer and entrepreneur Antonio Vaca Diez. La Casa de Fierro is one of the finest as well as best-preserved samples of civil architecture in Peru. The walls, ceiling, and balcony are plastered in rectangular sheets of iron. It is said to be the first prefabricated house in the Americas. Although popularly said to have been designed by the French architect Gustave Eiffel, there is no evidence at all that this is true; the building does not reflect his architectural style. Since 2011 well substantiated claims prove it was built in the Belgian workshops of Les Forges d'Aiseau (Joseph Danly process). Rubber baron Anselmo del Aguila bought it at the International Exposition of Paris in 1889. Once dismantled, it was brought in pieces to Iquitos (the metal sheets were carried by hundreds of men through the jungle), and assembled there in 1890. Since 1985, it is being administered by the Club Social de Iquitos; which has contributed in its restoration. Its second floor now has a restaurant. Today the house servers as a restaurant in the second, La Casa de Fierro Restaurante, and stores in the ground level. A fully different story of the origin of the house is told in Mario Vargas Llosa's Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (Pantale\u00f3n y las visitadoras), a comic novel."

It was built for a local real estate developer in 1884 in the Eastlake Style of Queen Anne architecture. A carriage house in the Shingle Style was added in 1886. The house is located at 1700 3rd Avenue South in the Stevens Square neighborhood of Minneapolis. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its architectural significance. Attorneys for the construction, plumbing and electrical companies that had previously won a court judgment for unpaid work at the museum joined to purchase the property for $1.3 million: the total amount a judge found that they are owed. The group was the sole bidder at the public auction. Beginning in 2008, the Minnesota African American Museum and Cultural Center occupied the structure. The museum began a $6 million fundraising effort to renovate it. Although the museum spent several million dollars on improvements, its fundraising effort failed to cover the cost of renovations. Creditors won a lawsuit in September 2015 evicting the museum. The creditors now jointly own the property. In 2016, the property and adjoining carriage house were divided into 9 apartments."

Construction started in 1990, and it was opened by King Harald V on 16 May 1993. Following the construction of the tunnel,  of railway around this area was also rebuilt to achieve higher train speeds, a shorter overall distance, and to maximize the natural protection from the weather.

The word \"bossa\", which is sometimes translated as \"style, flair or attitude\" in Brazilian Portuguese, is commonly associated with Bossa Nova, a samba-influenced type of Brazilian music. The name Bossaball, therefore, expresses the aim to combine sports, music and positive vibrations.

        "content": "The Bull Stone House is located in the Town of Hamptonburgh, New York. It is a ten-room stone house built in the 1720s by William Bull and Sarah Wells, pioneer settlers of Central Orange County, NY. It is one of the few homes in America still owned and occupied by the same family. The current resident is a ninth generation descendant of the couple. Bull, a stonemason, met and married Wells in the Wawayanda Patent (much of the present day towns of Goshen, Hamptonburgh, Minisink, and Warwick) while they were both working for the patent proprietors. Sarah Wells, an orphan, arrived in the area as the Goshen's first female settler in 1712. She came there to work as an indentured house servant at the age of sixteen.  In 1715 Bull arrived in North America from Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England and also came to work on the Wawayanda Patent, where they met. He was the hired mason for Daniel Crommelin, a French immigrant and New York City merchant. Their marriage in 1718, was the first between European settlers in Goshen. Building the house was a joint effort between husband and wife. William bought 100 acres in 1718 adjacent to Christopher Denne's land. Denne was Sarah Wells' master. Eventually, the widow Elizabeth Denne sold 100 acres to William and Sarah's first son, John, when he was just 8 years old. It is family lore that the widow was fulfilling a promise Denne made to Sarah to convince her to act as his land agent in the land claim. The Bull Stone House still stands today and is in the possession of the William Bull and Sarah Wells Stone House Association. When construction began, Sarah carried some of the stones to the site and William cut and laid them, while they lived in a temporary log cabin. It took thirteen years to complete, surviving a 1727 earthquake in the process. (Other sources place the date of the house's construction as 1722 or 1727). The completed building stands 40 feet square () and has walls 2 feet thick. The house was reportedly used as a safe haven during the seven years of the French and Indian War though no known fighting or battle was waged on the property. Sarah and William raised 12 children to adulthood in the house. Each of the children married and had children of their own. William built many stone houses around what is now known as Orange County. In the last year of William's life, 1756, he completed a stone house in New Windsor now called Knox Headquarters, which was the headquarters of several American generals during the American Revolution. Their descendants dispersed within the adjacent region, with the houses of Thomas (now a county museum) and William III also on the National Register. The family has lent its name to the hamlet of Bullville and Thomas Bull Memorial Park. Sarah Wells survived William Bull, who died in 1755\u201356. She remarried Johannes Miller sometime between 1756 and 1769, but separated from him in 1770. She moved back to her Stone House, where she died at the age of 100 years and 15 days, leaving 335 direct descendants. The county government has renamed Orange County Route 8, near the house, to Sarah Wells Trail, in her honor. The local Girl Scouts council was named for her as well. Both Sarah and William are buried on the property next to Hamptonburgh Cemetery on Sarah Wells Trail. The house and surrounding property have remained in the Bull family's ownership. In 1920 the family incorporated as an association of descendants. Today a ninth-generation descendant lives at the house as the resident family caretaker. Tours are available for the general public for a small fee. Descendants from all over the United States have returned to the house every year since 1868 for a family reunion. The house has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1974. The  William Bull and Sarah Wells homestead boasts another historical structure of significance, a New World Dutch barn."

The park covers one city block, bounded by Main, Capitol, Walnut, and Washington Streets. The park was renamed \"Confederate Park\" in 1923, at request of United Daughters of the Confederacy. The park contains several historic structures, including a Victorian-era gazebo near the corner of Walnut Avenue and Washington Street, the Demopolis City Hall, built in 1869\u201370 as a courthouse annex, and the old Presbyterian Church, built in 1843 and now known as Rooster Hall.  The former church served as the Marengo County Courthouse from 1868 until 1871, when the county seat was temporarily moved from Linden. The park's center features a large cast iron fountain that was installed in 1895. The park is often used for the city's festivals, most notably for many of the Christmas on the River events.  The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 29 November 1975."

        "content": "The Francization of Brussels refers to the evolution, over the past two centuries, of this historically Dutch-speaking city into one where French has become the majority language and lingua franca. The main cause of this transition was the rapid, yet compulsory assimilation of the Flemish population, amplified by immigration from France and Wallonia. The rise of French in public life gradually began by the end of the 18th century, quickly accelerating as the new capital saw a major increase in population following Belgian independence. Dutch \u2014 of which standardization in Belgium was still very weak \u2014 could not compete with French, which was the exclusive language of the judiciary, the administration, the army, education, high culture and the media. The value and prestige of the French language was so universally acknowledged that after 1880, and more particularly after the turn of the century, proficiency in French among Dutch-speakers increased spectacularly. Although the majority of the population remained bilingual until the second half of the 20th century, the original Brabantian dialect was often no longer passed on from one generation to another, leading to an increase of monolingual French-speakers from 1910 onwards. This language shift weakened after the 1960s, as the language border was fixed, the status of Dutch as an official language was confirmed, and the economic center of gravity shifted northward to Flanders. However, with the continuing arrival of immigrants and the post-war emergence of Brussels as a center of international politics, the relative position of Dutch continued to decline. Simultaneously, as Brussels' urban area expanded, a further number of Dutch-speaking municipalities in the Brussels periphery also became predominantly French-speaking. This cultural imperialism phenomenon of expanding Francization  (dubbed the \"oil slick\" by its opponents), often imbued with a condescending attitude of some monolingual French-speaking communities towards Dutch \u2014 remains, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in Belgian politics and public discourse."

        "content": "CJEU is a Canadian radio station licensed to broadcast a French language children's radio format at AM 1670 in Gatineau, Quebec. The license is held by Fondation Radio-Enfant, a non-profit educational agency. Fondation Radio-Enfant was originally granted a short-term license, with the call sign CIRC, on 96.5 FM for the duration of the Rendez-vous de la Francophonie in 2002 and in 2003, Fondation Radio-Enfant was also granted to operate at 1250\u00a0kHz on the AM dial (formerly used by CBOF), however, due to possible technical issues, the station never went on the air. The 96.5 frequency in Gatineau was later reassigned to CFTX-FM, and Fondation Radio-Enfant was granted a permanent AM license in early 2007 to operate at 1670\u00a0kHz. Initially, CJEU played music mainly in French and sung by children. Most of the music that is played, however, was not professionally recorded. In late 2010, the station was renamed as Radio Oxyg\u00e8ne, expanding its programming to include programs for teenagers and young adults. Programming for younger listeners was renamed Radio-Enfant-Ado. At one point, the station was known as Radio Jeunesse. In 2015, the CRTC approved an ownership change for CJEU from Fondation Radio Enfant du Canada to Radio Communautaire Enfant-Ado de Gatineau-Ottawa."

It is in the Mahakoshal region in the geographic center of India.Many ancient temples can be found here. Near to Barman town is Rajmarg national highway. Barman is surrounded by Bitli ki pahadi, one of the major hills in Narsinghpur district. Barman is education center for surrounding villagers. Barman is situated 15\u00a0km from a small Town called Kareli. A square has been named as \"Barman Chowk\" in Kareli. Barman is the holy place,Barman has two main ghat- one is the bramhan ghat and other is retghat. In retghat every year a fair is organised in which thousands of people come from all over india\"\"cn\"\". The junction of the Narmada and Warahi rivers at Brahman is a sacred place and a large fair is held here in January. A number of temples have been constructed at Barmhan, and fine flights of steps leading up from the Narmada on the northern bank.The large temple on the southern bank of the river is called Rani Durgavati's, as it is supposed to have been built by the famous queen of the Gond-Rajput dynasty of Mandla. Another temple on this side is called the Pisanhari's, as it is supposed to have been built by a corn-grinder out of her small earnings. Another important temple is that of Lakshmi Narayan. At the top of the steps on the northern bank is a great gateway called the Hathi Darwaza, as elephants can pass through it. This was built by the Lodhi malguzar of Umaria. There are several temples on this side, the principal ones being the Bairagi's temple, built by a well-known Bairagi of Indore, and a temple of Rama and Lakshman with a large pillar of stone in front, on which are depicted the past and future Avatars of Vishnu. Nearly opposite to Barmhan there is an island in the Nerbudda, and at this place five kunds or small tanks are shown which are supposed to have been used by the Pandava brothers during their sojourn at Barmhan. There is also a foot-print of Bhima. The island contains a copper mine which was formerly worked by the Nerbudda Coal and Iron Company,but was abandoned as unprofitable. The fair is held in January and lasts for a month, the shops and booths being located in the bed of the Nerbudda. The attendance is heavy on the principal day of the festival of Til Sankrant. It is a very old fair and was formerly of great importance, as it was the annual occasion for the purchase of cloth, household utensils and other important commodities for the whole District. The merchandise brought to Barmhan in 1864 was estimated by the Deputy Commissioner to be worth more than 6 lakhs of rupees, of which more than half found a sale. The principal article of trade was English cloth of which two lakhs worth were received. Next to this lac ornaments and brass and copper utensils were the commonest goods. In 1892 the value of goods brought was Rs. 2-37 lakhs and that of the sales Rs. 1-57 lakhs. The total attendance is said to have been 450,000. In 1903-04 the total number of shops was 253, most of them being for the sale of cloth, metal vessels and utensils, and provisions. Statistics of the sales of produce are not available. An agricultural and cattle show is now also held and prizes aredistributed by the District authorities. The village of Barmhan is held revenue-free for the support of the temple of Lakshmi Narayan.[1]"

        "content": "Like other parts of the world, climate in Idaho has changed dramatically over the geologic history of the Earth.  Paleo-climatic records give some indication of these changes.  The longest instrumented records of climate in Idaho extend back to the late 1800s.  Concern over human induced climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and methane from agriculture and industry, are driving research efforts across the state at university, state, and federals levels to understand what the implications of climate change could be in Idaho. In the big picture of greenhouse gas emissions, Idaho emits the least carbon dioxide per person of the United States, less than 23,000 pounds a year. It relies mostly on nonpolluting hydroelectric power from its rivers. Like other parts of the world, Idaho has seen significant temperature increases, especially in the last several decades.  From 1971 to 2005 the average annual observed temperature in the Snake River Plain, located in southern Idaho, has increased by 1.4 degrees Celsius based on data from 10 climate stations (Dubois, Ashton, Oakely, Pocatello, Aberdeen, Hazelton, Jerome, Boise, Nampa, and Payette).  Statistically the increasing temperature trends are most significant in the months of January, March, and April.  While precipitation has generally increased since the early 1900s, the high variability in precipitation makes the identification of precipitation trends statistically difficult. Over the course of the 21st century, climate in Idaho is expected to experience additional changes due both to 'natural' climate variability and due to feedbacks related to the interaction between climate variability and increasing greenhouse gases. For example, based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the United Kingdom Hadley Centre\u2019s climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100 temperatures in Idaho could increase by  (with a range of  to ) in winter and summer and  (with a range of  to ) in spring and fall. Precipitation is estimated to change little in summer, to increase by 10% in spring and fall (with a range of 5-20%), and to increase by 20% in winter (with a range of 10-40%). Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The amount of precipitation on extreme wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extreme hot days in summer would increase because of the general warming trend. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible."

It is part of the Harrisburg\u2013Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area in the United States. It was named for Dr. Lewis Heck (b.1810 \u2013 26 Aug 1890 Heckton). Reared in Shippensburg, Dr. Heck settled here in 1832. He practiced medicine and served as a Representative in the Pennsylvania General Assembly during the American Civil War. He also operated a large steam sawmill nearby from 1843 until 1890 and that specific area was known as Heckton Mills. By 1899 the entire little community was known as Heckton. U.S. Routes 22 and 322 pass through Heckton as a four-lane expressway close to the Susquehanna River, with full access from PA 443 (Fishing Creek Valley Road). US 22/322 leads south about  to Harrisburg and northwest about  to the borough of Dauphin. Years ago, Heckton could be reached by travelling N Front Street/River Road (Old 22) about  from Harrisburg to Heckton Road. But Heckton Road was bisected when U.S. Routes 22 and 322 were expanded to a limited access expressway. So the Heckton Cemetery (old Riverview Cemetery) and Cemetery Road which parallels US 22/322 can be accessed from PA 443, just northeast of the US 22/322 interchange. The historic Heckton Church was erected in 1885 for use by Methodists. In 2009, it was moved by Fort Hunter Mansion and Park to its current location at 5264 North Front Street. The church is available for weddings."

        "content": "Selena Etc. was a South Texas-based boutique, salon, and clothing store, which was built by the late American singer, Selena. Selena Etc. was built and finished on January 27, 1994, in Corpus Christi, Texas, which was the headquarters building. Selena opened another boutique in San Antonio, Texas, around the same time the headquarters building was complete; both were equipped with in-house beauty salons. Selena began manufacturing clothing along with designer Martin Gomez with designs and styles of Latin American texture and exotic clothing styles which became her trademark on stage. Hispanic Business magazine reported that the singer earned over $5 million from these boutiques. Another boutique was due to open in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1995, but due to Selena's murder it was not opened. The San Antonio boutique was closed sometime after 1999. After Selena's death, Chris P\u00e9rez, Selena's widower, took over the business. After the 16th anniversary of the opening of the Corpus Christi boutique, the store was officially closed as of July 2009. A week after the store closed, P\u00e9rez placed a \"for sale sign\" in front of the building.  The appraised price of the land and structure was USD$91,454  according to the Nueces County Appraisal District. Perez' asking price for the property was $165,000. The Selena Etc. store had a full-service salon, as well as Selena memorabilia, which was scooped up by admirers of the singer. They also sold jewelry, hats and other accessories. Soon after the foreclosure, due to the low economy, all merchandise and accessories began selling at the Selena Museum, located several miles from where the Selena Etc. building once was."

It operated under the name Dragon Fyre from 1981 to 1997, when it was respelled to Dragon Fire. The name was quietly reverted to the original name in 2019. It was one of the four original coasters at Canada's Wonderland. The ride is built at the east end of the park in the Medieval Faire section. It is located adjacent to the parking lot, so it is one of the first coasters that is seen. The coaster has a green and yellow track with purple support poles. Since the removal of Drachen Fire from Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Dragon Fyre is also the only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counterclockwise-turning corkscrews. Dragon Fyre was designed to operate with three trains, which is made evident by the fact that the ride has a set of safety brakes following the corkscrews and before the helix. However, due to the ride's short duration, it would be very difficult for the ride staff to load a train in the station without having one train stop in the middle of the ride. Because of this, Dragon Fyre never used its third train. In 1987, the third train was modified for use on The Bat."

With so much industry and commerce, the Port of Manaus has become a sophisticated cosmopolitan center. Located next to the Amazon rainforest, it also attracts crowds of tourists who find a variety of land and boat trips into the jungle. Wildlife is plentiful, even within the city, and it is home to the pied tamarin, one of Brazil's most endangered primates.

Though mainly agricultural areas border the forest in the east, in all other directions the Dresden Heath is bordered by districts of the city and reaches nearly to the city centre in the southwest. The forest exhibits a transition, both in its geology and in its plant and animal life, between the North German Plain and the Central Uplands. Except for small areas, the Dresden Heath is considered part of the western Lusatian Highlands and, consequently, is one of the westernmost parts of the Sudetes. Though the rocky subsoil of the forest was raised during the tectonic formation of the Dresden Basin, the mixed woodland of the heath is largely characterized by dune-like sand deposits of the Wolstonian Stage and Elster glaciation. The proximity of the Dresden Heath to the centre of Dresden led to its use as a princely hunting ground, as well as its cultivation and cultural development."

        "content": "A catastrophic magnitude 7.0\u00a0Mw earthquake struck Haiti at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010. The epicenter was near the town of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Ouest department, approximately  west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. By 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000, although these latter figures are a matter of some dispute. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. The nation's history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs contributed to the existing poverty and poor housing conditions that increased the death toll from the disaster. The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other cities in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, H\u00e9di Annabi. Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. The most-watched telethon in history aired on 22 January, called \"Hope for Haiti Now,\" raising US$58 million by the next day. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritising flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in mass graves. As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January, the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day, the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors."

The Diocese of Cariboo was formed in 1914 and ceased operations on December 31, 2001 after being forced into bankruptcy when the financial strain of legal costs associated with damage suits brought by former students of the Anglican-run St George\u2019s Indian Residential School in Lytton, B.C., exhausted the diocese financially. The parishes that make up the Territory are overseen by Bishop Lincoln Mckoen who was elected at an Electoral Assembly on 25 January 2020 and consecrated Bishop at St. Paul's Cathedral Kamloops on 19 September 2020.  Bishop Lincoln succeeds the former Suffragan Bishops to the Metropolitan Barbara Andrews who served from 2009-2020, and Gordon Light who served from 2004 to 2008. On November 14, 2015, the Council of the Anglican Church of Canada's General Synod gave final approval to recognition of the Anglican Parishes of the Central Interior (APCI) as a \"recognized territory [with] the status of a diocese\" (but not called one) and the former territory of the former Cariboo diocese.

Koch (1838\u20131877), the second principal of the Colombo Medical School. It stands directly in front of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Edwin Lawson Koch was born on 29 November 1838 in Jaffna, the son of John Godfried Koch, a local proctor and Angenita Dordthea Aldons. Koch originally qualified at the Bengal Medical College in Calcutta before obtaining his Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Aberdeen. In July 1862 he entered the Ceylon Medical Service and was a surgeon at the Colombo General Hospital (now known as the 'National Hospital'). Koch was one of the first lecturers at the Colombo Medical School when it opened in 1870 and succeeded Dr. James Loos as principal in 1875. On 20 December 1877 he died of sepsis from a wound he received whilst performing an autopsy. He is recorded to have been \"a bold Surgeon, a successful Physician and an expert Obstetrician\". Through the efforts of Dr. J. L. Vanderstraaten (one of the other lecturers at Colombo Medical School) Rs 3,000 was raised by public subscription for the construction of a clock tower, with Sir James Longden, the Governor at the time, on behalf of the government, donating the clock, which cost Rs. 5,000. The plaque on the clock tower carries the inscription: \"In memory of E. L. Koch, M.D. Principal Medical College Erected by Public Subscription and Civic Medical Officers 1881\"."

The Act automatically affects all shipwrecks that meet the \"historic\" criteria (generally defined as vessels more than 75 years old, although newer ships with historic value may be placed under the Act) and are in Australian Commonwealth waters (between the low-tide mark and the edge of the continental shelf): complementary state and territory legislation protects shipwrecks in state and territory waters including rivers and bays. Of the estimated 8,000 shipwrecks in Australian waters, more than 6,500 are protected under this legislation. Most shipwrecks under the act can be accessed by the public, although no items may be removed from the wreck site without permission, and divers must take care not to damage or disturb the wreck. Any items removed from a protected wreck (including those removed before the Act came into effect) must be listed on a database maintained by the Federal department responsible for maintaining and preserving Australia's cultural heritage (the Department of the Environment and Energy). As of 2011, over 500,000 artefacts and relics are listed and recognised. Anyone disturbing a protected shipwreck can be fined up to A$10,000, or imprisoned for a maximum of five years. The Act was repealed by the provision of assent  on 24 August 2018 to the Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018 which  commenced on 1 July 2019."

The uprising was put down by Colonel H\u00e9ctor Benigno Varela's 10th Cavalry Regiment of the Argentine Army under the orders of President Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen. Approximately 300-1,500 rural workers were shot and killed by the 10th Cavalry Regiment in the course of the operations, many of them executed by firing squads after surrendering. Most of the executed were Spanish and Chilean workers who had sought refuge in Argentina's Patagonia after their violent strike in the city of Puerto Natales in southern Chile on 27 July 1920 was crushed by the Chilean authorities, at the cost of four carabiniers killed. At least two Argentine soldiers (Privates Fernando Pablo Fischer and Domingo Montenegro), three local policemen (sergeant Tom\u00e1s Rosa and constables Ernesto Boz\u00e1n and Juan Campos) and a number of ranch owners and their relatives also died during the strife. Several of the captured women were raped in the uprising as the rebel forces fought for control of the territory.

It is located in the Municipio de Tem\u00f3sachic at an altitude of  in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Many of the people of the region are members of the indigenous ethnic group called Mountain Pima or the Pima Bajo. They are related to the Pima and Papago (Tohono O'odham) of Arizona and northern Sonora, speaking a similar but distinct language. Most maps give the name as Yep\u00e1chic, but the citizens in the town and the road signs in the vicinity spell it Yepachi. The population in 2010 was officially listed as 851, but this number swells to a few thousand on the holidays when people from small hamlets in the surrounding region congregate in Yep\u00e1chic. The climate of the region is one of the coolest in all of Mexico. Snow is not uncommon for the region in the winter. Spring and Fall are dry seasons, with thunderstorms prevalent in late summer. Predominant vegetation in the region is a mixed forest of pine and oak. Mountains are frequently rather steep, often with loose crumbling soil preventing easy travel. South of Yep\u00e1chic, there is a deep canyon with thorny, scrub vegetation characteristic of more arid regions. Some of the flatter regions have been cleared for farming. The people of the region plant maize, beans, squash, potatoes, and various other crops. They also raise cattle, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and other livestock. The local people eat most of the crops themselves, but most of the cattle raised is sold to buyers from the lowlands. There is also lumbering in the region, a needed source of income for the people of the area."

The company claimed that it devised blood tests that required very small amounts of blood and could be performed rapidly, thanks to the small automated devices the company had developed. However, these claims were later proven to be false. Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. A turning point came in 2015, when medical research professor John Ioannidis, and later Eleftherios Diamandis, along with investigative journalist John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal, questioned the validity of Theranos's technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. After several years of struggle, lawsuits, and sanctions from CMS, what remained of the company was dissolved on September 4, 2018. On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani were charged with fraud by the SEC. On June 15, 2018, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges. Balwani was also indicted on the same charges. The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2020, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Holmes's pregnancy. Holmes's trial began on August 31, 2021, while Balwani's trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022. Holmes was found guilty on four counts on January 3, 2022."

To the right is the baroque church of San Martino. The frieze reads  Gentilibus suis Picolomineis (Family of Piccolomini). The design is attributed to Antonio Federighi. Construction began in 1462, and was completed within the year. The Via di Pantaneto flank of the loggia has a series of heraldic shields with the Piccolomini emblems, five supine crescent moons on a cross."

The reflective glass building, by the firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee Architects, seats 2,248 people. The church was touted as \"the largest glass building in the world\" when it was completed in 1981. The building has one of the largest musical instruments in the world, the Hazel Wright Memorial Organ. Until 2013, the building was the principal place of worship for Crystal Cathedral Ministries (now Shepherd's Grove), a congregation of the Reformed Church in America, founded in 1955 by Robert H. Schuller. Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in October 2010 and in February 2012 sold the building and its adjacent campus to the Diocese of Orange for use as the diocese's new cathedral. The building, especially the interior, was renovated by Johnson Fain to accommodate the Catholic liturgy. Following the completion of construction, the building was consecrated and formally renamed \"Christ Cathedral\", the seat of the Diocese of Orange, on July 17, 2019."
